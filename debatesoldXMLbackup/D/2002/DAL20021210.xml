    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council published a summary of the recommendations of its strategy report on 19 November and copies have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library. The report sets out an agreed approach to the economic and social contexts in which negotiations on a successor to the PPF should be set, the main challenges to be faced in the period ahead and the options or paths to be followed in tackling those challenges. I take this opportunity to commend those involved in the production of a high quality report that provides valuable guidance and direction on issues of major national importance.</P>
      <P>Formal meetings such as the PPF plenary session in Dublin Castle on 31 October complement the meetings which I hold with representatives of the social partners on a regular basis. In this context, I met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at its request on 20 November, along with my colleagues the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. The meeting provided an opportunity for an exchange of views on the social partnership process. I reiterated that it was important to recall that social partnership is a long-term process which has underpinned our progress over the past 15 years. The social partners have shared short, medium and long-term goals. The Government believes it is to the mutual benefit of the partners, particularly in a difficult environment, to seek to reach a common understanding of the problems and to develop jointly framed responses to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ICTU identified a number of issues, such as housing, health, public transport and caring, as being of concern to it in the context of the Estimates for 2003. I emphasised that in formulating <Col N="4" /> the Estimates for next year, the Government was guided by the need to ensure that the levels of public spending were consistent with actual and projected economic growth, which in turn affects revenue levels. During the growth period and continuing into this year, public expenditure rose sharply &ndash; the rate of increase in spending in 2001 and 2002 totals almost 40%. Much of this has gone into the expansion of services in recent years, particularly in the health and education sectors.</P>
    <P>Capital investment by Government under the national development plan has also increased significantly. However, we must protect our hard-won economic gains by being prudent in the management of the public finances. We will not repeat the mistakes of the past in terms of excessive borrowing and high levels of taxation. The Government regards social partnership as an important contribution to the governance process in this country. However, as in the past, there are times when it is essential that Government takes hard decisions in the interest of achieving widely shared goals, even though they may be difficult for the social partners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent asked for my views on the implications of this meeting for discussions on the successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. As the Deputy will be aware, I formally launched the talks at the last PPF plenary meeting in Dublin Castle. Following on from this, a series of bilateral meetings is now well under way and, as with previous agreements, the proceedings are subject to normal confidentiality arrangements in order to protect the negotiating positions of all. However, each of the social partner pillars, as well as the Government side, has made clear on many occasions in the recent past its own priorities and concerns.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government also indicated that the models of participation in the social partnership process would be reviewed, including an examination of ways of maximising the efficiency and effectiveness of the process and the potential contribution of the community and voluntary sectors. A number of organisations, including the Senior Citizens' Parliament, have applied for inclusion in the social partnership process. We are considering how we can achieve our objectives in the context of these applications and it is an inherent part of the process that any changes proposed will be discussed with the relevant social partner pillar. In this context, each applicant organisation has been asked to provide a formal statement of its case for inclusion in the social partnership process, and my Department is in contact with these organisations.</P>
    <P>The Government remains fully committed to seeking an appropriate basis for a new agreement between all of the social partners. I believe that the NESC analysis is helpful in this regard. All of the parties are aware that any new agreement will have to take account of the uncertain economic climate over the past year or so. As NESC has indicated, we will have to agree a suitably flexible <Col N="5" /> strategy which allows us to continue to tackle major national priorities such as health care, child care, education, equality, poverty, infrastructure and competitiveness in the context of our future economic performance as a nation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pay terms of any agreement, based on the exploratory contacts over recent days between Government, the employers and congress, I believe there is scope to agree a new deal. Both employers and unions have indicated a genuine willingness to enter serious and intensive negotiations to find a pay deal whose terms address their legitimate concerns about living standards, competitiveness and jobs. While any deal must address the needs of workers and employers in the private sector, similar concerns arise for Government, as an employer, and public servants. Any deal on pay will be reached in the context of commitments by employers, unions and Government in relation to the workplace environment and in the context of the wider strategy to tackle our shared economic and social priorities contained in the overall agreement.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leis an Taoiseach as ucht an freagra a thug sé. I was interested to hear the Taoiseach say that he would like to see a review of the talks process. What review or changes does he have in mind, other than obtaining a statement from each of the constituent partners? Might he consider the absent environmental pillar, which has not had a part in the partnership process so far? Does the Taoiseach agree that the budget has not helped raise hopes for a new partnership agreement? The failure to implement the national anti-poverty strategy, a key objective of the last agreement, will make it difficult for the Government to appear credible as it goes into this round of talks. Will the Taoiseach take on board the view of the ICTU that welfare increases should be linked to average earnings, as recommended in the strategy, or the CORI assessment that there should be an increase of &euro;18.70 per week in the next four budgets to meet the Government's commitments in the national anti-poverty strategy?</P>
      <P>How will the Government address inflation, which is heading towards three times the EU average, in the partnership talks? Will he ask the Competition Authority to investigate the pharmacies, drinks traders and other professions to root out anti-competitive and inflationary practices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of organisations applying to different pillars have put forward cases. The agreement over many years is that any new groups are discussed with the relevant pillar. To enable us to do that, we have asked for a formal statement of the case for inclusion in the process by the groups in question. Some, including the Senior Citizens' Parliament, have responded to the request already. Contact with the organisations and with the pillar they would like to join <Col N="6" /> is ongoing. I cannot, however, confirm any details for the environmental group. It is open for any group to join any pillar, and it may have applied because there are a number of organisations in each. We extended the number of pillars in the last round of negotiations. We do not want the organisation base to become unwieldy and we have succeeded with that so far. I have no difficulty with this. It might make negotiations slightly more cumbersome but different sectors are covered and that outweighs leaving out any groups.</P>
      <P>As in all cases, some people will be happier with the budget than others. Some will feel more could have been done for their sector. The Minister had to make decisions based on the resources available to him on the day and spread them in as even a way as possible, taking all issues into account.</P>
      <P>The revised national anti-poverty strategy, with its new targets for the reduction and, if possible, elimination of consistent poverty and the achievement of a rate of &euro;150 in 2002 terms, presents a challenge. Resources are also demanded by other related areas dealing with employment, education, health, housing and administration. Many related plans have been laid out under the PPF, such as the health strategy, the parallel primary care document, the national action plan against racism, reports on homelessness and the national anti-drugs strategy. They are all reviewed on an ongoing basis. The social economy group and all other groups in PPF try to make improvements in pay and in legislation. Many of the proposals have been already implemented. I hope they will continue in the future regardless of whether there is a programme in place. I think the NAPS strategy should remain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in 2000-01 &euro;1.5 billion or &euro;1.6 billion was spent on these categories under the PPF. The assessment was reported back to the PPF groups. There have been enormous financial resources put into this area. Funding will probably increase more slowly now, but I hope we can get back to a position where it will increase substantially. These are all policy areas which are listed and structured. I hope we will continue to make progress in this area under any partnership process, even though it may not happen as quickly in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Sorry, Deputy Sargent. Some 45 minutes is allowed for questions and we cannot allow the whole of the time for the Deputy's supplementary questions. I call Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach disagree with anything in SIPTU's statement on the budget making the securing of a new social con<Col N="7" /> tract virtually impossible? Does he disagree with SIPTU in regard to the inflationary impact of the VAT increases on excise duties, the lack of provision for child care facilities, the failure to index tax bands, the failure to increase tax credits in line with inflation, the achievement of bringing more people into the top rate of tax and the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant? All of these measures, together with a range of charges that increase the cost of living and take more take-home pay out of the pockets of workers make securing a new social contract immensely difficult. Is there anything in that menu on which the Taoiseach disagrees with SIPTU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy enough to look at a budget and say what is not included, what one would like to see included and what aspirations one would have. I disagree with many aspects but if one looks at individual areas one will see the progress being made in many areas. While the Exchequer provision for housing is down, the provision for Exchequer capital expenditure is &euro;932 million. This is more than double what it was when the PPF began and Exchequer funding was &euro;450 million. Non-Exchequer spending for local authority housing has increased to &euro;1.7 billion, up 7%. People commented that funding for public transport was not sufficient but it stands at &euro;1.5 billion or &euro;1.7 billion. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been allocated &euro;70.8 million for child care provision, an increase of 21% on the allocation for this year. The Estimates provision for the ongoing equal opportunities child care programme is substantially increased.</P>
      <P>I could take issue with many aspects of the budget. If one looks back over the past two years when there was an increase of almost 40%, I accept the increases are not now as high. I do not contend that without a social partnership deal we can continue to make enormous strides. During the various discussions, I take issue with many aspects such as the health issue, where there has been an allocation of 709 beds, even in a more difficult year. The extra &euro;53 million next year will mean an overall investment package, including capital expenditure of &euro;118 million in that initiative alone. There is the treatment purchase fund and we have seen improvements in areas dealing with cancers. Many of these issues have been raised by the ICTU. I cannot agree and think that not to have a social partnership agreement will not improve matters. These are issues on which the Government, to the best of its ability, will maximise resources and try to put as much money as possible into areas of concern to ICTU and the Government over the next few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, a Cheann Comhairle. I did not mention inflation although Deputy Sargent mentioned it. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned initiatives on health, housing, child care and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>On inflation, I take issue with the Deputies. It is fair for the Government to point out that in a number of areas more resources could be gained if products such as drink and cigarettes were left out of the index. The Government has repeatedly requested the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to agree to that. Last week, the Minister's total increases amounted to 0.85% of inflation; some 0.42% of that related to cigarettes while a significant amount also related to drink. Drink and cigarettes are not essentials and could be taken out of the calculation and more resources could be raised to put back into health and other areas. We were not in a position to do that because of the weighting of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are still concerns about inflation even though Central Bank and other figures have shown that it will drift down over the next year or two. We must be careful in these negotiations to consider the rate of competitiveness generally and pay levels particularly. Pay levels have gone up by over 30% in recent years compared to 13% in other countries. That is a significant danger and inflation is part of it. I accept that care must <Col N="9" /> be taken but there are ways of dealing with this, and I highlight the areas of drink and cigarettes.</P>

      <P>How can the Taoiseach stand there and expect us to believe that he has even a tráithnín of credibility in calling on workers to again play a con game called national partnership, and in reality to accept a new wage control deal, when his Government has not raised a finger over several years to stop profiteering in services &ndash; including the rip-off under the cover of the euro &ndash; which has severely impacted on working people's ability to purchase, and when his Government has raised in the budget a series of taxes under other names?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, an important question, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Taoiseach expect workers to accept wage restraint when one stockbroking firm today predicts that inflation could shoot to 6.5% next month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Taoiseach squarely why any worker who needs to put a home over his or her head for the first time should accept national partnership or wage restraint when the Government snatches a £4,000 grant from him or her and increases the price of a home by &euro;2,000 through a VAT increase? Is the Taoiseach aware that the Central Statistics Office has clearly shown that since 1987 the amount of national production going to wages or salaries as a proportion has dropped dramatically while that going to profit, dividends and rents has increased dramatically as a result of outrageous profiteering which his Government did nothing to stop?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe it is moral to stand in the Dáil and call on workers to accept wage restraint when he does not call on speculators and builders to moderate the profiteering in the building industry or on private landlords to moderate the profiteering in the private rented sector? Does the Taoiseach believe that his Government and the bosses can fool all the workers all the time? That will not be the case from now on.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy saw in the budget that a substantial amount of tax will be clawed back from what the Deputy considers the business class. That is right. However, the Deputy must accept that the pay increases, not <Col N="10" /> to mention the tax breaks in recent years, have substantially eroded the competitive position of our economy. Like the Deputy, I want to maintain the highest possible number of jobs in our society. We have been lucky in that we have been able to employ approximately 96% of the total labour market in recent years. That is a big improvement on our weak position. We want to keep as many of those people as we can in jobs and that should be the main purpose of price stability. I acknowledge we have a battle to fight in that regard and that people in certain sectors, which have been well identified, are taking an increased share of profits.</P>

      <P>They are not all large firms or financial sector firms. They are spread across a range of services, particularly the professional services. The State agencies must continue to fight that battle. As Deputy Sargent said earlier, some of these sectors have shown big increases. Last week I mentioned pharmacies and other areas where competition may help, although it may not solve all the problems.</P>

      <P>As regards the Taoiseach's comments about remodelling the nature of social partnership, will he elaborate on that to take into account the position in which we find ourselves? Does the Taoiseach agree that the current model is outdated and that it has protected some sectors from necessary reform in terms of value for public money for consumers and taxpayers? Does he accept that the broader needs of the community should be dealt with to a greater extent and given greater priority in the future? An article published some time ago by the Fine Gael spokesman on finance, Deputy Richard Bruton, pointed out that while partnership is important, partnership between the community, the employers and trade unions is equally critical. The focus has been on wages, employment and profits to the detriment of community relations and family pressures. Employers and unions tend to be first division players, while other interests in society, which must deal with important issues, have been relegated to the second division.</P>
      <P>Given the statement by David Begg that, from an ICTU perspective, the failure to index tax rates and to tackle the important issues of housing and health will make another partnership agreement practically impossible, does the Taoiseach share the view that the current position is outdated and that we should move into the broader perspective of making the Dáil more relevant and effective in terms of creating the type of society and country in which our people must live in the future and abiding by the consequences of whatever agreement is put in place? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different aspects. In my reply to Deputy Sargent, I spoke about some <Col N="11" /> of the additional organisations which are outside the social partnership process but which feel they have a national profile and could usefully join one of the pillars. The process will be made workable if these organisations are open minded about their involvement in it as well as about following it once it is agreed among the pillars. I do not have a difficulty in that regard.</P>
      <P>On the broader question Deputy Kenny asks, bringing the social and community pillar into the process made the agreement wider than it had been on the five previous occasions. The first of those agreements was purely related to pay in bad times while the second was a pay agreement which also opened up elements of social progress in non-pay areas. The third, fourth and fifth agreements were very different in that they included large elements of non-pay agreements while the pay issue was settled between ICTU and IBEC on one side and the Government and the public service committee unions on the other.</P>
      <P>Dozens of working groups are involved in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and they have been working through various agendas related to &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; issues in housing, child care and health care. I am not sure it is the most efficient way of doing things. I have argued within the talks &ndash; as recorded on 31 October, which means I am not breaking a confidence &ndash; that it would be better to concentrate on a small number of strategic areas in the social partnership process. It is obvious the three or four areas would be in line with those mentioned by Deputy Kenny. Over a period of three years, we should try to make progress in those areas rather than attempt to save everything in society at once with an enormous number of officials working on all of these committees. It is an enormous task. If there is to be an agreement this time I would rather concentrate on a small number of areas such as child care, housing, retraining and lifelong learning. People may have different views about the areas to be considered, but those are a few that could be agreed. I hope any social partnership process will be along those lines.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked whether the Oireachtas should be involved. Last year, I stated that it is not a good idea to exclude the Oireachtas and even, on occasion, the Government from the partnership agreements. There should be regular reports to a committee of the Houses. My officials have gone to a great deal of trouble to provide very detailed progress reports, which are placed in the Library, but very little is done about them and there is not much debate. Useful debate could take place on some of those issues if they were not as lengthy as they are at present.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach noted the contradictions in the approaches of the authors of the texts of the national spatial strategy and of the National Economic and Social Council's recent report? There was only a week <Col N="12" /> between the publication of both. While the national spatial strategy offers the prospect of brighter times ahead, which we all hope it will deliver, it also offers compliments on claimed past achievements. However, the report of the NESC catalogues a very different picture of a past littered with failures. Does the Taoiseach agree with the NESC when it reports that Ireland faces an infrastructural deficit, the possibility of shortages in the generation of electricity and a low level of communications connectivity? Is he not alarmed when a body such as the National Economic and Social Council finds this State deficient in housing, public transport, roads, cultural and recreational infrastructure, telecommunications infrastructure, energy production and waste management?</P>
      <P>Regarding energy, does the Taoiseach believe it is ludicrous that the ESB, our own Electricity Supply Board, is precluded under European Union rules from building and running any more power stations in this country, despite the fact that we are currently looking at an energy shortage and facing the prospect of an energy crisis as a consequence? I would like the Taoiseach's opinion on that important issue also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the divergence of views between the NESC report and the spatial strategy. There is no need to tell the Deputy what the spatial strategy is seeking to do over a 20 to 30 year period to develop the country in a more balanced way so that we get proper balanced regional development and that the necessary infrastructure is provided to do that over a sustained period. NESC is looking at a short-term strategy for the short and medium term. It is highlighting the areas of infrastructure that still have to be dealt with. The Deputy knows as well as I do, why that is the case. It is because the economy has doubled in a decade and there are strains on some of the infrastructure. On its latest examination, while the ESB requires infrastructure it has the capability and the capacity to put it in place. It has had only one stretched day over the last three winters when it had a difficulty. I remind Deputy Sargent that, unfortunately, it was a calm day and wind power would not come to its rescue the only day it was needed. That is another difficulty about storing it and the interconnector.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully, it will keep going. Even in more difficult times we are spending on infrastructure, in GDP terms, about 2.6% which is over one percentage point more than any of the other European countries. We are spending on infrastructure and continuing to try to catch up with huge deficits on infrastructure. In the 1970s and 1980s, other than telecommunications infrastructure, very little was spent on secondary roads, the ESB and in many other areas. We are in a catch up phase with a growing economy. The <Col N="13" /> Deputy raised the question of the ESB. The ESB is experiencing difficulty in a number of areas. This is due to the fact that the industries in the areas are using enormous energy intensive plants which are a huge pull on the electricity capacity both in the factories on the west coast and on the east coast. However, the ESB believes it will get ahead of that.</P>
      <P>In so far as EU regulations are concerned, they are set, but they are not prohibiting the ESB from expanding. The ESB has invested an enormous amount of money in recent years and will continue to do so. If the Deputy is putting forward the view that the ESB will not be able to keep up with the capacity, that is not the case. Other companies are allowed take a proportion of generation and they are doing that and are taking a slice of the action. It is not prohibiting the ESB from investing. The ESB's capital investment programme is probably the largest it has ever had.</P>

I ask the Taoiseach to answer the point made by the deputy president of SIPTU. In a situation where inflation is heading for 5% or 6%, depending on which commentator one believes, why is it that ordinary workers ought to be prepared to sacrifice the gains of recent years in order to facilitate excessive price taking in several areas of the economy?</P>

This parliament, as the centre where difficult social issues are resolved, has been emasculated by the process of committees. There are committees on everything. The Taoiseach has set up committees of unelected people who are making decisions on serious political issues when the real centre of authority is here. As Deputy Kenny points out, many groups, including trade union rank and file, small business people, consumers and environmental interests, are not represented adequately at this table. We have allowed the centre of decision making to be eroded and removed from the elected people. We need to call a halt and bring central powers back into parliament.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point, which has been raised by him and others over the years, is important. What has happened is that over a sustained period the social partners and Government, working through various mechanisms, have given input and direction into a great deal of policy areas where, perhaps, this House has not. Perhaps that is the point the Deputy is making. I do not believe Ministers ignore reports from committees. Those reports are discussed regularly at Cabinet meetings, as has been the case over all the years I have sat at the Cabinet table. With regard to the social partnership process, with particular reference to economic and social develop<Col N="15" /> ment in key areas, as I have already said in reply to Deputy Kenny, I believe there are too many areas. I am trying to narrow it down to a few strategic areas this time, such as housing, child care, life-long training and other issues which come up year after year in which we can make real progress. To make a fundamental change in some of those areas, one needs everybody on side. While I do not wish to appear to criticise colleagues from either side of the House who chair committees of the House, those committees tend to bring in delegations from here, there and everywhere when, in fact, the relevant strategic policy initiatives are there in black and white for us to pursue, including the social partnership process and the national spatial strategy. There is no need to go into new areas. Committees can develop on existing policy areas and there is nothing to prevent that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton will be aware that it was his brother, Deputy John Bruton who, with my support from the Opposition side of the House some 20 years ago, moved this House into the committee system. As I was then, I am totally supportive of that system. I know there is relatively little interest from outside the House or, perhaps, from the media&mdash;</P>

Promises in relation to social welfare were also broken and, today, cuts in the back to work scheme have been announced.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the last budget in the PPF process. To answer Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, one has to look at the many positive aspects of this budget in conjunction with the measures taken over the entire PPF period. There have been enormous gains in pay, tax reductions and increased benefits, all of which are well documented in the material provided in the House on 31 October and 1 November. There are clear advantages in continuing that process and building on the work of successive Governments over the past 15 years, during which enormous benefits resulted from the social partnership process. There is nothing to be achieved by breaking the social partnership. We must sustain and build on our competitive position.</P>
      <P>I note Deputy Ó Caoláin's comments on corporation tax. The reality is that we are managing to hold on to jobs and markets in a difficult year in which exports have gone down from 16% to 4%. We have to keep our industry competitive. It is easy to say that a cut in corporation tax helps the wealthy. In fact, it is helping to provide jobs in this economy. We have come through two difficult years on international markets with some 96% of our labour force still working. That is a considerable achievement of social partnership and Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest inflation projection published by my Department was included with the budget documentation which indicated that inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, will remain broadly unchanged next year at 4.8%. The increase in the CPI will be higher in the next few months but will ease as the year progresses. Accordingly my Department projects a further easing beyond 2003, to around 2.5% by 2005. If the impact of the increase in tobacco which I announced on budget day is excluded from the calculation, CPI inflation is expected to fall to about 4.2% in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At budget time, it was also estimated that, as measured by the EU harmonised index of consumer prices, inflation would fall from an estimated 4.7% in 2002 to 4.2% in 2003. My Department closely monitors developments in relation to inflation. One of the main factors behind the current high inflation rate in Ireland is the high level of service sector inflation. This in turn reflects the high levels of wage increases in recent years as well as inadequate levels of competition <Col N="17" /> in some sectors of the economy. It is important that wage pressures, and the evolution of costs more generally, are not allowed to lead to a deterioration in competitiveness which would result in lower growth and higher unemployment. This is why wage moderation and cost moderation more generally are so important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that one of the problems we have had with inflation in the last 12 months is that the Government, far from playing a role preventing people being ripped-off during the course of the euro changeover, has driven inflation with increases in most charges for Government services running to six, seven, eight or nine times inflation? Does he agree that the increases in ESB charges of 13%, in VHI of 18%, in the drugs refund scheme of 26%, in hospital charges of 27% and in college fees of 69% are all Government generated increases in inflation in addition to those which he announced in the budget last week? Does he accept that the public is being asked to pay for the reckless spending that he and his colleagues engaged in over the last two years and that we are driving inflation and the cost competitiveness of the economy up a blind alley with this policy?</P>

      <P>Some of the items mentioned as driving up inflation are within the Government's control while some are not. The Deputy mentioned the ESB, which is a semi-State body while the VHI's board makes increases once a year. Other items drove up prices but the overall effect on the consumer price index is nothing like what the Deputy has alluded to. While people have anecdotal evidence of the increases in prices resulting from the euro changeover, a detailed survey by FÁS reported that the aggregate level of CPI inflation during the euro changeover period did not appear unusual in reference to historical standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget of last Wednesday will add 0.85% to inflation in 2003. Before the budget, I heard great play being made by Opposition Deputies and others outside the House to increase the price of cigarettes by colossal amounts. Of the 0.85% increases in inflation, 0.43% relates to the increase of 50 cent on a packet of cigarettes while 0.18% relates to the increase in the price of drink, although many people were advocating greater increases on drink. I thought it deserved attention but I have heard no one in the last week speak about the fact that we would not look at the effect that either drink or cigarettes would have on the CPI. We expect <Col N="18" /> inflation next year to average 4.8% which means for the early part of the year inflation will go upwards of 5%, possibly as high as 6%, but we expect the average to come down to 4.8%. The reason inflation has been so high in the past year to 18 months has been service sector inflation in the main due to higher wage costs.</P>

      <P>He certainly left the impression he wanted a period where people would not get wage increases. Does the Minister agree he has no credibility in asking for an extended period of no wage increases when he is generating inflation, as he admits himself, of 5.8%? Will he also agree that he is being extremely selective in the evidence he quotes? The ESB made an increase because it had to give extra dividends to the Government. The VHI increased its prices because Ministers made a decision it would increase hospital and drug charges to members. College fees are under pressure as a direct result of the decision by the Government to increase them by 69%. We are seeing further threats of increases in this area. Most of the so-called service inflation is coming from Government controlled services not from private sector services.

      <P>Of all the Deputies in the House, I know Deputy Richard Bruton does not believe half of what he said in the previous question because he understands the make-up of inflation and the figures. When he says the Government is responsible for the increase, he knows it is patently untrue. As the Deputy knows well from his detailed study of the CPI, the main cause of inflation is service sector inflation which is roughly 60% of the make up of the index &ndash; the remaining 40% relates to the traded sector. It is totally incorrect to say the reason the ESB increased its prices related to the demand by the Government for additional dividends. The Government gets a small dividend from the ESB &ndash; it is less than I would like but it has nothing to do with the increase in prices.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy if he is making a general case that it is in everyone's interest to drive inflation downwards because if it is around the EU average of 2% or 2.5%, increases in social welfare and public spending will have a greater effect. We must not get into a wage-price spiral because that is what got us into difficulties in the 1970s.</P>

      <P>Table IDS 1 of the Revenue Commissioners' statistical report for 2001 reports 22,471 income earners with gross incomes in excess of &euro;100,000, about 1.4% of the total at all income levels. This number includes 14,609 self-employed income earners, including proprietary directors, representing 6.4% of the total in that sector. The figures in question are not indicative of the current position since they relate to income arising in the year ended 5 April 2000.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for the 2002 income tax year it is estimated that the total number of income earners on tax records with gross incomes above &euro;100,000 is of the order of 53,600 or about 3% of the total. The number includes 31,500 self-employed earners, including proprietary directors, representing almost 10% of the total in that sector. The definition of gross income used does not include certain items. For example, it is net after the deduction of superannuation by employees and excludes income that does not have to be returned to the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes such as child benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on the incomes of PAYE earners is obtained by the Revenue Commissioners from end of year returns filed by employers and from individual taxpayer returns. Income information is provided by the self-employed in self-assessment tax returns. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the credibility of incomes returned under the self-assessment system is a matter to which Revenue pays particular attention. An integral part of the self-assessment system is the audit programme under which taxpayers' returns and accounts are examined, either by way of desk audit or field audit, to ensure proper declaration of income and deductions. The great majority of cases selected for audit are selected on the basis of perceived defects in their tax returns and not on a random basis. This means that most cases are chosen for audit following a risk analysis which may suggest the <Col N="20" /> possibility of incorrect returns for any of the taxes. Selection of cases on this basis has proved to be very successful. There is also a small random element which is regularly reviewed.</P>
    <P>In 2001 Revenue completed more than 16,000 audits and investigations under the various audit and investigation programmes. These yielded &euro;208 million. In general, the scope and extent of the compliance and audit programmes reflects Revenue's professional assessment from year to year of where tax is most at risk and where resources might therefore be devoted to best effect.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are continuing with their overall approach, on the one hand, to make procedures easier for those who are trying to meet their tax obligations and, on the other, to pursue people who do not pay on time or at all, using the various powers available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply stated that only 22,471 taxpayers reported gross incomes of more than &euro;100,000, according to the Revenue Commissioners' statistical report for 2001. He also stated that the latest figure for this income category is 53,600. Does the Minister not find this figure to be truly astonishing for the years when the Celtic tiger was roaring away? In the same years, sales of top of the range Mercedes and other expensive cars averaged around 14,000.</P>
      <P>Is it not true that one of the reasons for this low reported income by such a small number of taxpayers is the existence of a wide range of tax shelters, some of which the Minister is proposing to close at the end of 2004? The bulk of them, however, relate to small self-administered pension schemes, which are only useful to the very wealthy. Will the Minister indicate how much income is sheltered by wealthy people in such schemes? </P>
      <P>As regards the income that is not declared in these returns, the Minister mentioned child benefit. Will he confirm whether income from stallion fees and nominations would also be included in these returns? Or, is it correct that the income from such fees does not have to be included in the returns of very wealthy individuals, even if it is tax exempt? The figures are truly astonishing and highlight the extent to which the Minister has allowed extraordinarily generous tax shelters&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can send the Deputy details of the household budget survey, and can explain why those figures do not tally with the figures from the Revenue Commissioners. Part of the reason relates to the matters she has raised. Last week I referred to write-offs that are available <Col N="21" /> and in the coming days I will refer to a more up to date study that has been completed by the Revenue Commissioners. Some years ago a study was undertaken which showed how high income earners write off a large amount of their tax through the use of capital allowances and so on. As I pointed out last Wednesday, the situation has improved and I will place further studies in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The Revenue's statistics and those from the household budget survey are not comparable. I have details concerning cars to which the Deputy referred, and that can be explained also. A considerable amount of tax is paid by high income earners. I have some details in my notes which I can send on to the Deputy.

      <P>At the request of Dublin City Council the Office of Public Works has carried out some emergency works since the severe floods on 14-15 November 2002. There was a danger of subsidence at three houses off Tolka Road following the failure of a protecting wall and the Office of Public Works was requested to place rock along approximately 30 metres of the exposed bank to stop further erosion. To secure this more fully a concrete wall is now being built, similar to the original wall, along this stretch. Rock has also been placed in the bed of the channel to prevent scouring of the new wall. A number of trees that were obstructing the flow of water in this area were also removed. This work is due to be completed in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>I understand that Dublin City Council has also undertaken some emergency work by installing temporary flood defences in the Griffith Park area. The council has also undertaken a programme of gully cleaning in the areas affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Dublin City Council, at the request of the Office of Public Works, agreed to include a detailed study of the River Tolka in the greater Dublin strategic drainage study. The study is being funded by the Office of Public Works and is expected to be completed in May 2003. Following the recent flooding, the <Col N="22" /> consultants were requested to produce an interim report on what measures could be taken in the immediate term to alleviate flooding in the worst affected areas. The interim report is currently being studied by officials of Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works. A meeting has been arranged between the council and my officials for 16 December 2002 to progress the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the interim report, to which he referred, has recommended that urgent works be undertaken at a cost of &euro;8 million?

The consultants have stated that these works are urgently required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>They can only be carried out, however, if the Office of Public Works agrees to fund them to the tune of approximately &euro;8 million. Given that his Department is responsible for anti-flood measures, will the Minister give a commitment that any interim works the consultants have found to be essential will be funded, regardless of any budgetary constraints? Even if a commitment is given next Monday to fund those works, with planning permission requirements, such works could only start in March or April 2003. This matter is most urgent and should be considered by the Minister immediately. I am asking for his response. These works relate to the following areas: Botanic Avenue, Millmount Avenue, Clonliffe Road, Ballybough Road and Richmond Road. If they are not carried out and there is more heavy rainfall, there is a danger that hundreds of houses will again be flooded.</P>

While I do not wish to pre-empt next week's meeting, I know the Office of Public Works's staff and equipment will be involved in building embankments among other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the issue of funding, the Office of Public Works does not currently have any powers to do any work on the Tolka River. The Office of Public Works requested the report to be commissioned and paid &euro;870,000 for it, but the issue remains as to who will fund the work. At the moment, it is a project for Dublin City Council and clearly it will have to come from central funding at some stage. It is not the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, however. The Office of Public Works will assist Dublin City Council <Col N="23" /> and as a result of the discussions that will take place on 16 December, a decision may be taken with regard to funding. At this stage, however, I do not want to pre-empt how that will work out.</P>

In his reply to the Dáil following the floods, the Minister of State stated that no interim measures would be carried out. The urgent works that are now listed in the preliminary report are the very ones which were outlined by other Deputies and me in this House. It is patently obvious what needs to be done. If the Office of Public Works is satisfied that these works are urgent, and presumably it will accept the recommendations of the consultants it has appointed, will the Minister of State give an assurance that funding will be provided for the city council to carry out the works, or a combination of Office of Public Works workers and funding, and that these interim measures, which are urgent and essential to prevent further floods, will be carried out without delay? The Minister of State has a direct responsibility for this issue. He would not be answering the question in the House if he did not.</P>

The Deputy made some recommendations and I said that Office of Public Works and city council engineers and the consultants for the major report, which is not due until May, would produce an interim report. The bulk of the report is about raising walls and embankments. It also mentioned some restrictions on the river in terms of footbridges, as discussed by the Deputy. It is substantial work, amounting to &euro;7.3 million. When it is decided to do the work, it will have to go through the full planning process, go to tender and be submitted for observations. This will not happen overnight. I assure the Deputy and the House that the Office of Public Works will make all resources available to Dublin City Council to get the best response possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of tax incentives exists regarding the housing market in the case of first-time buyers and other owner-occupiers, investors and tenants. For owner-occupiers, mortgage interest relief at the standard rate is granted in <Col N="24" /> respect of interest paid up to a ceiling on loans used for the purchase or improvement of a person's sole or main residence. Preferential arrangements exist for first-time buyers over other owner-occupiers. The existing higher ceilings for first-time buyers on allowable interest were increased in the budget. The period for which these increased ceilings will apply is being extended from five years to seven years.</P>
      <P>All owner-occupiers, including first-time buyers, are generally exempt from stamp duty on new houses where the property is 125 sq. m. or less. In addition, there is more favourable stamp duty treatment for first-time buyers of second-hand houses up to &euro;381,000, as compared to other purchasers. Owner-occupiers also are not subject to capital gains tax on the gain from the disposal of their main residence.</P>
      <P>In relation to investors, in budget 2002, against a background of increasing rents and a shortage of rental stock, I reintroduced mortgage interest relief in respect of borrowings for use in the rented residential sector. For tenants, tax relief at the standard rate is available to individuals in respect of rent paid on their accommodation.</P>
      <P>Last year was the seventh successive year of record housing output. Total housing output for the first six months of 2002 was 25,418 units, up 5.2% on the same period in 2001. The housing market is a complex and dynamic one and demands continuous monitoring and adjustment to address changing circumstances. I consider that the tax incentives currently available represent the optimal mix and are adequately balanced in light of the current state of the housing market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, interest, allowable at the standard rate of 20%, which is &euro;1,600. Ordinary first-time buyers had a tax credit of &euro;1,600 when buying their own house, whereas investors have an open-ended claim on their investments. The rent they receive is totally allowable, even at the marginal rate of 42%. If one takes a house which is rented for &euro;12,000 per annum, which is cheap even in rural areas, that gives the investor relief of &euro;5,000 per annum as a tax credit. How can one balance the first-time buyer at &euro;1,600 and the investor at &euro;5,000?</P>
      <P>The Minister took away new house grants. In his documentation on the budget he said that new house grants were costing &euro;38 million per year. He said that the replacement scheme which he put in place cost &euro;8 million. He took &euro;30 million from first-time buyers by that stroke of a pen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of VAT on houses, does the Minister not think it is mean to add VAT from 1 January even for first-time buyers who have contracts in place? They will pay the additional money on VAT over the course of the coming <Col N="25" /> year. By the Minister's stroke, first-time buyers will lose &euro;5,800 as a result of the budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised three aspects. The main purpose of the first-time buyer's grant, which was introduced in 1977, was to encourage the building industry. It was not necessarily meant for the first-time buyer. It was to pump up the building industry. Most reasonable people would agree that over that period the benefit has gone to builders rather than first-time buyers. It has been recommended for many years that it should be withdrawn. I replaced it in the budget by mortgage interest improvements for first-time buyers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I increased the number of years from five to seven and increased the allowable interest, in the case of a married couple, to &euro;8,000. That is more targeted, it will go to the first-time buyer. The old grant scheme meant that the first-time buyers of second-hand houses did not receive it at all, whereas the mortgage interest relief applies to a first-time buyer, irrespective of his or her buying a first or second-hand house.</P>

When we made the changes recommended in the first Bacon report, I did not say strongly enough that making changes to an area where supply and demand should rule is usually fraught with difficulty.

However, there are no women on the board of the Central Bank, despite the fact that women grace every other office in this country, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of women who have experience in law, accounting and finance, and all those women who have significant experience in terms of managing the upbringing of children and looking after elderly people, all of whom could give the Minister the independent advice of which he spoke.

I am certain there are many women who would adequately fulfil these requirements. It is a matter of judgment and choice and whom I consider appropriate at the time. Appointments to the board of the Central Bank are important and in my time as Minister I appointed people whom I considered to be the best available. My predecessor and former leader <Col N="28" /> of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, did not appoint any women to the board of the Central Bank either, and perhaps he would trumpet his great qualifications in this regard.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his answer. In relation to price elasticity of each of the products mentioned, is it not the case that the State gains more money, despite the social and health grounds cited by the Minister in various budgets? One key example of this relates to tobacco. The Office of Tobacco Control has stated that a price increase of &euro;2.50 could go on a box of 20 cigarettes with the State continuing to earn income from that excise duty despite the consequent fall in demand for that product. Can the Minister be taken seriously regarding increases imposed for social and health reasons only when the revenue to the State begins to decrease?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily agree with the Deputy. However, I am glad he mentioned the increase in excise duty on tobacco. As I said earlier, I have not heard much comment about this in the past week from people either inside or outside the House in the context of the national pay talks. The effect of all of the changes I made in indirect taxes is 0.85% of which half, or 0.43%, relates to the 50 cent on the pack of 20 cigarettes. Another 0.18% relates to the changes I made regarding drink. That makes up more than two thirds of the 0.85%. Prior to the budget I heard many people advocating an increase of &euro;2.50 in the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes. That would have increased the CPI by nearly 2%. One can only imagine the furore there would have been in the context of the talks. One would not want to give the impression that the Exchequer or the Minister for Finance may be looking at this in a particular light. I have been advised for a long period of time to make massive changes in the price of cigarettes. However, nobody seems to have seen that in the context of the talks. I do not <Col N="30" /> mind the unions not taking it into account, but I thought commentators would have referred to it. I thought we were moving away from that, but nobody seems to be so doing.</P>

      <P>One thing intrigues me. That is the 1% elasticity on spirits. I was taught &ndash; I do not know whether that has changed in the Department of Finance &ndash; that a 1% price increase would result in a 1% volume fall. However, the Minister has projected quite a considerable increase in revenue from spirits as a result of the 20 cent on the glass of spirits. How did the Department of Finance work out that there would be extra revenue? More generally, is it the Minister's view that price and tax should be used as a tool for driving down the consumption of tobacco? Would the Minister support, philosophically, such a long-term future role for taxation in the fight against tobacco? Does he support a policy of increasing the price of cigarettes to reduce consumption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked at this matter before deciding to increase the price of cigarettes by 50p in a budget some years ago. I was assured by experts in the subject that the increase would reduce the consumption of cigarettes. I have been a reformed smoker for some years and I appreciate that smoking is a most debilitating habit that costs the State hundreds of millions of euro. The theory explained to me was that while an increase in the price of cigarettes would not necessarily help people to give them up, it would stop people from starting to smoke. The figures I have seen since, neither prove nor disprove the theory. I recall that the increase had an effect on the CPI index of about 0.78% and everybody wanted compensatory increases as a result. I have to balance a number things when framing a budget, as was seen last week. I have listened to Deputy Richard Bruton's advice and I do not think the evidence is clear, as the 50p increase some years ago did not reduce consumption. However, there is a theory that price increases stop people from starting to smoke.</P>

      <P>During the debate between the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children &ndash; we know how much they like each other &ndash; in the run-up to the budget, the Minister, Deputy Martin, indicated that additional increases in the cost of cigarettes would be ring-fenced for use in the health services. There has been no indication, whether in budget documents or in speeches by the Ministers, that such ring-fencing will take place. Additional tax receipts arising from the increase in the price of cigarettes will be added to the general tax fund, rather than being allocated specifically to the health funds, which will suffer from substantial cutbacks in 2003. There will be a reduction in the number of employees in the health sector.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that many capital projects have run considerably over budget. The greatest failing among Departments has been that they have inaccurately estimated the cost of the projects they have proposed under the national development plan. When detailed tendering commenced, the cost of such projects was shown to be far higher than the initial Estimates. The out-turn of various projects was also in excess of the Estimates, as a result of high inflation in the construction sector.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Richard Bruton's opinion of the Department of Finance's forecasting methodology, a matter about which another question has been asked. Although tax revenues for 2002 will not meet the predicted levels, the shortfall will amount to a very small percentage of the total. Deputy Bruton knows from his professional experience that estimating tax returns is not an exact science. I am sure he will agree, however, that under my stewardship, the Department of Finance expenditure out-turn at the end of the year has shown, on average, a deviation of less than 1% from the estimated figures&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am interested in the Minister's remarks about spending. Does he agree that part of the reason expenditure will be close to the estimated amount is that benchmarking payments, which were due to be paid this year, have been deferred? He has balanced the expenditure side <Col N="33" /> of his accounts by imposing spending cuts of at least &euro;300 million on various Departments, even though he said before the election that no such cuts would take place, and by introducing inflationary increases for charges in public services, at a cost of &euro;1,400 to the average household in 2003.</P>

      <P>Like many others, Deputy Richard Bruton has signalled his misunderstanding of how the national finances are presented. The adjustments of &euro;300 million in the middle of the year were made to ensure that we came in at 14.5%. It was obvious at that time that spending provisions in areas like health, roads and Garda overtime had to be increased and I made adjustments in other Departments, as I did in previous years. Deputy Paul McGrath almost read into the record of the House a letter that I sent to Deputy Noonan on 13 May.</P>

      <P>My Department has been studying the report of the Ansbacher inspectors which was published in July. The parts of the report of particular concern to my Department relate to taxation matters, exchange control and the Central Bank. When this examination has been fully completed, consideration will be given to further measures that may be needed. In the interim, the Deputy will be aware that I intend to introduce a Committee Stage amendment to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, to impose an obligation on the bank to report to the Revenue Commissioners any information that leads it to suspect that a criminal offence of tax evasion may have been committed by a supervised financial institution. The bank will also be obliged to report to the Revenue Commissioners any failure by a financial institution to report suspected cases of money laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second Bill, which has already been the subject of a public consultation process, will oblige the directors of financial institutions to certify each year that the institution is fully compliant with all of its statutory obligations. Auditors of these institutions will have to review the directors' compliance statement and inform the directors and the new single financial regulator if they are not satisfied that it is accurate. The new regu<Col N="35" /> lator will also have a general right of oversight of corporate governance standards in institutions under its supervision. I expect to be in a position to present this Bill to the House in the first half of next year. The Revenue Commissioners have recently initiated discussions with the tax authorities of the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey concerning tax information exchange agreements between Ireland and these states. As I already indicated to the Dáil, the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing individual Ansbacher cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it taking so long to deal with this matter? The compliant taxpayer is scandalised by what has gone on in relation to Ansbacher accounts and it is a continuing scandal that the recent reports of income we discussed earlier should show so few taxpayers declaring incomes of more than &euro;100,000. Part of the reason for this is the tax shelters built by the Minister for Finance on very deep foundations, but it is mainly that schemes such as Ansbacher, although most accountants could tell the Minister of similar schemes in operation&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are pursuing these cases. More than &euro;20 million has been received to date, mostly by way of payment on section 59 cases. The Revenue team has inquired into 289 cases to date and six of these have included settlements. The total consists of 179 cases named by the authorised office of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and 110 similar cases discovered by Revenue. Most of these are still under consideration. Apart from these disclosed entities there are some 700 other connected entities on which the Revenue investigators are assembling information. I considerably increased the powers of the Revenue Commissioners in 1999. A special team in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners was dedicated to following up the Ansbacher inspectors' report and it is operating thoroughly and efficiently. The Deputy knows a little about this area, as I do. This is very painstaking work and they are finding it difficult to go back over so many years, but there is a full team involved and it is making progress.</P>

      <P>One of the Minister's wise men, who is currently reporting to him on the economy, famously said, in his previous capacity, that there was no pot of gold in relation to underpaid <Col N="36" /> or unpaid income taxes. Ordinary, compliant taxpayers are outraged that it is taking this Government, now in its sixth year in office, so long to come to terms with the litany of offshore schemes and tax avoidance mechanisms which are only available to the very rich and reduce by large amounts the amount of money available for necessary services. What additional resources and IT facilities has he supplied to the Revenue Commissioners to expedite these investigations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, I am introducing a Committee Stage amendment to the Central Bank Bill which will allow it to give information to the Revenue Commissioners if it unearths anything relating to tax evasion in the course of its operations. Criticisms of the Central Bank in the past were ill-founded because the previous legislation specifically precluded the Central Bank from giving that information to anybody. That will remain the case until I change the law in the Central Bank Bill.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, while Deputy Burton was temporarily absent from the House, any requests from the Revenue Commissioners for additional resources were granted by me. This was documented in many replies to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's newspaper reports carry a statement from the Minister for Health and Children admitting that there will be cutbacks in jobs in health this year. He is refusing to speculate about whether this will amount to 5,000 jobs. This might be funny if it were not so serious, because the battle of Ballymascanlon still continues and apparently rages without cessation inside the Cabinet. It appears as though the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, has taken the view that we live in an economy, not a society. Has the Taoiseach intervened in this row? Are we to have a Department of Health and Children and a health budget or a health service? Having dealt with these warring factions, will the Taoiseach indicate whether the proposed heart-lung transplant unit in the Mater Hospital is to be scrapped on foot of the Minister for Finance's comment about the dictating of medical treatments? Over &euro;8 million has been spent on this unit, which was promised by Fianna Fáil in the 1997 election. Has the Minister for Finance proved that he is capable of hard decisions, if not wise ones?</P>
      <P>The Minister has also questioned the use of artificially manufactured blood products in the treatment of haemophiliacs. This has been denied by the Minister for Health and Children. What is the truth? Will the Taoiseach clarify the number of job losses foreseen for the health area? Was the Minister speaking only of unapproved jobs, or are these to go as well as a segment of the 5,000 pertaining to the Department of Health and Children? Will those jobs include speech therapists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists? Will there be more unfortunate incidents like that in Kilkenny last week where local facilities were not made available by a Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children will continue to implement the health strategy. The 5,000 jobs mentioned in the budget were part of the overall figure for all public services. There is no question of one area taking up any substantial number &ndash; they will come from across the entire service. There has been an enormous increase in staffing levels in the last few years. The increase in health service employment reflects a variety of factors &ndash; demographic pressures, record levels of funding activity, provision for additional replacement staff due to changing work practices, changes in the composition and structure of employment growth and reductions in vacancy levels resulting in reduced dependency on agency staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the announcement on budget day of the planned reduction in public service numbers, discussions will commence between the relevant Departments regarding the practical steps <Col N="38" /> required to implement the measure over the coming years. As the Minister for Health and Children stated, the Department's priority will be the maintenance of front line staff to provide a service to the public and protect essential services. The reductions in numbers can be achieved through natural wastage across most Departments over the next three years. With costs increasing by 88% because of the rise in the number of staff in the last few years, it should be possible to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Bed capacity services, the treatment purchase fund and acute hospital activity will continue. The Minister will continue to develop primary care and the lung transplant programme, for which &euro;4.5 million is being provided for 2003. Provision for the treatments of disabilities, cancer and cardiovascular disease are all contained in the Minister's Estimate for next year. In his last report, he stated that more than 70 of the 121 strategy actions are being worked on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance have always been the best of friends, that is how the Minister for Health and Children manages to get the billions of euro needed to run the health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance stated that the health strategy will not be implemented next year or the year after. Is that a fact? How many of the unapproved staff in the health service will be let go and how many will be approved? How many jobs will be lost to the health service as a result of the cut of 5,000 in public service numbers and the embargo on recruitment? Will those jobs include physiotherapists, speech therapists and occupational therapists? Why is one Dublin hospital paying more to lawyers than doctors while in another major Dublin hospital a psychiatric patient has occupied an orthopaedic bed for the past three months? Are we to have a health service or a Department of Health and Children with a health budget? Will the Taoiseach intervene to prevent the warring factions from making a shambles of a health service where hundreds of thousands of people are ill at ease because of inadequate service? The Taoiseach's own consultants reported that the Department of Health and Children is unable to absorb money because of the way it is being flung at it and that it is an obscene waste of taxpayers' money. In a perversion of logic, people are being flown out of the country while hospital wards here are being closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is continuing in 70 of the 121 strategy actions. The Estimates for next year show the Government has provided for 74% of the net total increase in public expenditure to be set aside for health expenditure. Staffing levels in the health service have reached 96,000. The tightening up of numbers should be achieved by natural wastage and the Departments will work that out between themselves. Front line services will be maintained. By the end of the year, 520 beds <Col N="39" /> will be funded, 70 more than in the strategy target. More than 1,800 patients are in the treatment purchase fund and 960 treatments are expected this year. I reject the allegation that the health service is not well funded and staffed at both day to day and infrastructural levels. As the Minister continues to implement the health strategy, it will improve.</P>

      <P>Since the Taoiseach entered office in 1997, the price of housing has doubled, rents have doubled, the number of homeless has doubled to 5,500 and the number on local authority housing lists has risen from 26,000 to 48,000. In the most bitter cut of all, retrospectively applying the 1% VAT increase will add a further &euro;2,000 to the average house being purchased by young people. That increase follows the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant of almost &euro;4,000. A total of &euro;6,000 is being added to the agony of young people who are trying to buy their own homes in the last three weeks. Will the Taoiseach agree to follow previous practice where the implementation of increased VAT charges follows a transitional arrangement that will protect those who have signed contracts? How can the Taoiseach justify 8,000 people, having signed contracts to purchase their own homes, finding that at the stroke of a pen they will now be charged an additional &euro;6,000 on average as a result of the deliberate actions of this Government?</P>
      <P>The first-time buyer's grant was abolished at the stroke of a pen and now VAT is being applied retrospectively. Will the Taoiseach agree that the transitional arrangements put in place the last time VAT was increased will be applied now and that 8,000 people will not have that additional element imposed on the contract price of houses they thought they had purchased for &euro;6,000 less three weeks ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance made provisions last week for tax issues and VAT. The Deputy should table a question to the Minister to inquire about these issues. The last time such a change was made was in 1993, when I restructured the five VAT rates to two rates of 12.5% and 21%. VAT on houses at that time was 10%, having doubled in a few years, and I increased it by 2.5%. It was for that reason the changes were made in 1993.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the other points made by the Deputy. We are building record numbers of houses as the demand for them continues. We completed over 5,000 local authority houses in the last year.</P>

      <P>I do not think investors live in local authority houses. A further 7,000 houses are under construction. Between 1997 and 2001, 18,400 local authority housing units were provided. I am aware of the numbers on the waiting <Col N="40" /> list. We have also been supporting the voluntary housing sector by providing 4,000 units. A further 1,500 units will be provided this year and we have also implemented a number of other measures for next year. There is more than &euro;1 billion in the housing budget for next year to continue the rapid increase in the housing sector. Deputy Rabbitte spoke about people who have signed contracts. These people will receive the new housing grant, therefore, they will not be disenfranchised because they will have the new housing grant and they will be able to avail of the tax relief introduced last week.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach think it is any comfort to people who have had charge after charge piled on them as a result of the Government's earlier mismanagement of the public finances to say that I can put down a question? I am asking the Taoiseach what he will do about it? I am asking him if it is not standard Revenue practice to permit transitional arrangements such as I have suggested? Given the miserly &euro;10 million he purports to claw back from people enjoying tax shelters and loopholes of various kinds, why is he allowing these people two years to accommodate to those changes while applying retrospectively the VAT increase for young people trying to buy a home of their own? How can he justify capping the rental allowance so that tenants are now exposed to the full savage rent increases happening in the marketplace, which will lead to additional homelessness, an additional &euro;5 per week on average to a poor person on supplementary welfare allowance, while giving back 16,000 sites over the next three years to builders because he cannot enforce the agreement the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, made with them and which he is now backing out of? Surely he can agree that the transitional arrangement, which is normal Revenue practice, will be applied in this instance.</P>

      <P>The question the Deputy asked is one for the Minister for Finance who made the position clear last week. VAT on housing will increase to 13.5% from 1 January. The only transition arrangement of which I am aware was when I introduced a 25% increase, from 10% to 12.5%, which was not a normal Revenue arrangement. This took place when a restructuring of five rates of VAT was taking place.</P>

      <P>Perhaps a record number of unaffordable houses? Is the Taoiseach comfortable with the speed at which top civil servants can move from highly influential posts and being custodians of sensitive information to being privately employed and very powerful individuals with extraordinary advantages over their competitors in the private sector? Is it not a scandal and grossly irresponsible for the Government to have no regulations in this area, which is unique in European terms?</P>
      <P>Is it not deeply disturbing to see, for example, a former manager of South Dublin County Council within four weeks of resigning his post in December last year being employed as a lobbyist and consultant for a major developer facing High Court action over unauthorised developments in the same local authority area? How can the Taoiseach remain silent on this issue when his former adviser is now a director of Treasury Holdings, vying for the contract to build the national stadium, having been the head of the Campus and Stadium Ireland development and privy to all the original bidders and plans? How at this point is it still possible for the Taoiseach to say there is no particular need for regulations? Will he give some thought to this matter and introduce regulations, as are available in other jurisdictions, to ensure there is a healthy period of time between public servants occupying influential positions as custodians of sensitive information and being able to use that information in the private sector to essentially subvert the normal private tendering procedures?</P>

      <P>Nor do I wish to personalise the circumstances of the contractual arrangements. This issue was raised previously and there is no statutorily based rule that prohibits an individual leaving public service &ndash; Departments, agencies or local authorities &ndash; to take up these positions. If there was such an arrangement it would have to have statutory effect. There was an unwritten rule in the Civil Service that one should not leave and take up a position on files with which one was dealing previously. I am aware of one country which has a three or six month regulation, which is not very satisfactory. When the instance of another individual was raised some <Col N="42" /> years ago it was found difficult to introduce such a rule or regulation. This is not something to which the Government will be immune because more people are leaving the public sector in the last decade. As a result of the seven year contract, people now leave at much younger ages than was the case previously. While this issue may not have been so prevalent some years ago, it is now. I cannot recall what the legal difficulties were previously. However, I will look into the matter and send a note to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Taoiseach that in other jurisdictions, particularly in the UK, there is a two year cooling-off period, so to speak, as part of the Civil Service regulations. Will the Taoiseach agree that we need such a regulation? I am not impugning or saying there is an issue to be answered, other than to say that tribunals are ongoing. There is the situation of a former Government press officer who now faces one of the tribunals, which is not very flattering for him or the Government he served. Will the Taoiseach learn the lessons of the past and put in place the essential statutory regulations whereby top civil servants, or anyone who is a custodian of sensitive information, will have to observe a certain period before becoming employees of the private sector? Will the Taoiseach take on board the lessons in this country and other countries where there is a cooling-off period which is much longer&mdash;</P>

      <P>Jim Mitchell was always a conviction politician. Jim was born on 19 October 1946, the seventh of ten children. His father died when Jim was just ten years of age. At the age of 14, he did the entrance exam for Guinness's brewery and worked there until he did his leaving certificate. Subsequently, he studied computers in Trinity College, joined the Fine Gael party in the 1960s, was attracted to the liberal wing of the party and had a deep interest in the just society concept.</P>
      <P>In 1970 he stood in his first by-election in Dublin South-West and in 1973 was principally responsible for the election of Declan Costello in that constituency to serve in the Cosgrave coalition Government. In the same year, he married Patricia Kenny &ndash; his wife Patsy &ndash; from Mountbellew, County Galway. In 1974, he was elected to Dublin County Council. In 1976, he contested his second by-election in the constituency of Dublin South-West and, at 29 years of age, became the youngest Lord Mayor in Dublin's history.</P>
      <P>In 1977, he was elected as a Deputy for Ballyfermot, his second constituency, and was appointed as spokesman on labour by Garret FitzGerald. In 1981, he was elected as a Deputy for Dublin West and was appointed Minister for Justice. During his term as Minister, he introduced legislation to abolish the death penalty. He was subsequently re-elected in February 1982 to the Dublin West constituency and again in November of that year. From 1982 to 1984 he served as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Transport and from 1984 to 1987 as Minister for Communications and oversaw the splitting of CIE into three companies and the bringing about of An Post and Telecom Éireann.</P>
      <P>In 1985, he served as president of the EU Transport Council and in the 1992 general election was elected to Dublin Central, his fourth constituency. In 1994, he was a narrow loser in the European elections and in 1997 he again decided to run for the Dáil and was elected to Dublin Central. In that period he underwent emergency surgery for cancer and was appointed to the chair of the Committee of Public Accounts. In 1999, he ran in the European elections and the Committee of Public Accounts under his chairmanship began investigations into the deposit interest retention tax irregularities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" />In 2000, despite his illness and in severe pain, he produced the final report of the DIRT inquiry. In September 2000, he published a document &ldquo;Democratic Revolution&rdquo; which had wideranging references and proposals for the bringing about of an effective Parliament in this Chamber. He also published a document dealing with the libel laws. In February 2001, he was appointed deputy leader to Fine Gael party leader Deputy Michael Noonan. In May of this year, he unfortunately lost his seat in the general election.</P>
    <P>Of all the politicians I have known, Jim Mitchell was one who displayed political generosity of a kind seldom seen in that he invited candidates from all quarters to serve with him in whatever constituency he stood. He showed remarkable courage and generosity in that sense. He could be direct, abrasive and controversial, but he was always a staunch defender of his point of principle. His vision encompassed the bigger picture, the interests of society and the people in general.</P>
    <P>He will be sorely missed by the people in Inchicore from whom he was never parted and by the people of Dublin who regarded him as a giant on the political stage for more than 20 years. His work was exemplary both as a Minister and as a Deputy in Opposition, when he held a number of front bench portfolios. His integrity, enthusiasm and commitment were evident to all.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that Jim had a great sense of humour and wit, which are necessary parts of political life. I recall in the 1980s when the idea of having seachtain na Gaeilge was mooted, he tried to revive his Irish because he wanted to participate in it. His teacher was Michael Begley from south Kerry and instead of giving him the normal discourse with which the Ceann Comhairle would be familiar, he taught him a litany of invective which would do justice to the Dingle fare. I had to physically restrain Jim from coming in here and spilling forth his new found knowledge to the then Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>On another occasion, as director of elections for the Galway East by-election in 1982, he tried to bring the Dublin concept of mass contact with the electorate to the Galway East constituency. He decided as a final <i>tour de force </i>that there should be contact with all the electorate on the morning of the election, starting at 5 a.m. He outlined his plans in considerable detail. I had brought my fellow director of elections for the Tuam area, the then Deputy John Donnellan, to the meeting and when he heard Jim's plans, he asked him if he wanted to be eaten alive by every sheep dog in Galway East. However, that activity did not take place.</P>
    <P>Jim was a devout Catholic who was devoted to his wife and family. He displayed a wonderful understanding of human nature in all its forms. I was privileged to serve and work with Jim Mitchell and to know him. His legacy to Dáil Éireann and to democracy will stand the test of time. His work with the Committee of Public <Col N="47" /> Accounts is an example of how effective Dáil committees could be in the interests of probity, value for money and accountability. His document, &ldquo;Democratic Revolution&rdquo;, which aimed to make this Chamber and its proceedings more effective is a fitting legacy to a lad from Inchicore who rose to the heights of national Parliament.</P>
    <P>Jim was generous to a fault with his time and energy. He will be a great loss to this party. His loss to his wife, Patsy, to his sons, Neil and Ruairí, to his daughters, Sinéad, Aoife and Caitríona, to his brother, Gay, and to other members of his family will not be easily borne. I extend my deepest sympathy to them and to the extended Mitchell family.</P>
    <P>Jim was a devoted father. I stood in his house last Tuesday and it was obvious that it was a home. I was taken by a seascape painting on the wall. I know Jim had a great interest in the sea, its power and uncertainty. I am struck by the lines of the Irish poet, John O'Donoghue &ndash; not the Minister &ndash; in his poem, <i>Beannacht</i>. It states:</P>
    <P>When the canvas frays in the curragh of thought</P>
    <P>And a stain of ocean blackens beneath you,</P>
    <P>May there come across the waters</P>
    <P>A path of yellow moonlight to bring you safely home.</P>
    <P>Slán abhaile, Jim.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and on my behalf, I extend my deepest sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the death of Jim Mitchell last week. I also extend our sympathy to our colleague in the House, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and to all Jim's family, particularly his wife, Patsy, and their children.</P>
      <P>Jim Mitchell's career spanned 35 years. He worked for Fine Gael in Dublin for almost 30 years after he was first elected to the City Council. He held many distinguished offices throughout his career, including three ministries. He was deputy leader of his party and he was also involved in the Committee of Public Accounts and in the Committee on Finance and the Public Service. He spent a decade working on those two committees. He worked hard in terms of organisation and writing and in researching various issues. He made an enormous contribution.</P>
      <P>Expressions of sympathy in the House are often for people from the distant past who have passed away. Some of us knew the individuals, while others did not. However, everyone in the House and anyone outside the House with an interest in politics, regardless of their political persuasion, knew Jim Mitchell extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure of working with him on Dublin Corporation throughout my political life. As his party leader said, he became the youngest Lord Mayor of Dublin in 800 years when he was elected at the age of 29. That was a great record to achieve. It put pressure on him to perform well <Col N="48" /> during that year, which he did. He was an enormously successful and powerful Lord Mayor. He introduced many initiatives and plans for the city. He was successful in restoring dignity to the office and in starting the restoration work on the complex, which has continued. He felt strongly about the Mansion House, which was built in 1715.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kenny said, he controlled his base of Inchicore, Ballyfermot and Dublin west for all his political life and he worked hard for it. We were not in the same constituency at the beginning, but we were brought together by the same issues. We shared the same constituency for the past 12 years following a revision in 1990. I know how hard he worked and how dedicated he was to the people. Regardless of the circumstances, he always endeavoured to do his best for his constituents. He always tried to progress issues in a non-adversarial way. I have many examples where we worked together on issues, not as Opposition and Government or vice-versa. He always looked towards the long-term benefit. He worked on a number of issues related to education and community and health facilities for which legislation has not yet come before the House.</P>
    <P>When people look back at his record &ndash; it is important that Deputy Kenny put it on the record today &ndash; they will see that he made an outstanding contribution as Minister for Justice, Minister for Transport, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Communications. For almost a decade, from early 1993 until he became deputy leader of Fine Gael, he was involved in the finance brief. My time in the Department of Finance gave me an insight into his understanding of the regulations of the House and of technical details of the brief, which, with respect, most Members could never comprehend. He had a deep grasp of finance and public accountability issues and of how they are regulated and dealt with. He had an enormous capacity for detail and was very familiar with the relevant legislation which dated from the foundation of the State. I was at many meetings with senior officials from the Department of Finance and other accountable officers of the State at which he showed his enormous capacity for all the work involved. He will be remembered for the DIRT inquiry, but his involvement with finance issues, other reports of the Committee of Public Accounts and with the Committee on Finance and the Public Service over long years will stand to his credit.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Kenny and Members of the House in extending sympathy to his wife, Patsy, and to Ruairí, Sinéad, Neil, Aoife and Caitríona, the extended family and our colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell. On this side of the House Jim Mitchell will be remembered as a hard-working person for whom it was no difficulty to fight for his point of view. He was tough and hard, but fair, and he could always see the brighter side of life. Thankfully, there are always Members on both sides of House who can do that. Jim, certainly, was one.</P>

      <P>I join with the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, and the Taoiseach to pay tribute to the memory of Jim Mitchell on behalf of the Labour Party and myself and to offer our condolences to Patsy, his children, Deputy Gay Mitchell and the extended Mitchell family.</P>
      <P>Jim Mitchell was an immensely resourceful, courageous and thoughtful politician who made a difference. From the time he entered politics he made an impact whether in Government or in Opposition. Since entering this House he has been a key figure in his party, in Cabinet and on the Opposition Front Bench in devising strategies and policies. He was a tremendously successful harvester of votes and a most unselfish constituency colleague.</P>
      <P>I remember him for his sense of humour and fun, although I did not know about the attempts of Michael Begley to teach him Irish, which explains much about what we all had to put up with. It must have been something else. I remember him most of all for his role in the DIRT inquiry. A great deal has been written about the inquiry, but people should be in no doubt that it was planned, managed and led by Jim Mitchell. Anybody who, unlike Deputies Durkan and Ardagh, was not concerned with it cannot be aware of the amount of planning and preparation he put in to the process or of the professional manner in which he managed it. They will not know of his ability to manage an all-party committee. I am certain that though the committee had available to it the services of an eminent senior counsel, most of its legal advice was made up by Jim. I could see nothing in legislation to prevent Members going to the toilet or accessing mobile phones or which required us to abandon our clinics; nevertheless, those were the strictures he laid down. I cannot remember any other committee chairman ever receiving the same extraordinary degree of co-operation across the three parties that he did over a prolonged period of perhaps six months' worth of planning, hearings and reporting. It involved 14-hour days and work on Saturdays during all of which the entire staff of the Oireachtas was mobilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House were frequently required to work on Sundays. My colleagues will remember that when we thought we had more or less concluded the inquiry, Jim said the report would have to include a chapter on parliamentary accountability. We attempted to down tools on that Sunday afternoon, but he persuaded us at least to take a small document home with us. One of his ever-loyal adjutants who was waiting outside then arrived in with a filing cabinet full of documents on parliamentary accountability which we were required to read by Monday morning. That was the manner in which he proceeded, but not everyone knew at the time the extraordinary courage it took. For some of the period he experienced considerable discomfort and for a part of the time he was in very serious pain. I remember <Col N="50" /> occasions when we broke late at night and Deputy Ardagh had to bring his car to where we were and drive him home because he was in real pain. Yet, he ploughed on to the end to set down a template for the future. The fact that it has been so difficult to follow since shows the extent of his achievement.</P>
    <P>He insisted on the chapter on parliamentary accountability because he was convinced that the tribunals were manifestations of parliamentary failure. He believed that if this House was doing its job there would never have been a need for most of those tribunals. He was acutely aware of the separation of powers and of the distinction that ought to be drawn between the roles of Parliament and the Executive. There is a great deal of objective evidence to show that he was right to point out that Parliament has been gradually eroded over the years while the Executive has become more powerful and the Opposition is under-resourced. This, he insisted, was what the DIRT inquiry was about. It was a way to make the case that parliamentary committees could provide speedier, cheaper and more accessible resolution of many public interest matters while demonstrating that many of these issues would never have arisen if the Opposition was properly supported and Parliament asserted its role.</P>
    <P>If Jim Mitchell has left one legacy, it is the idea of an Oireachtas commission, the legislation for which is likely to be introduced during the next term. It is his crowning legacy to the Oireachtas and to politics because it will take responsibility for the administration of these Houses from the Department and give it to parliamentarians. It is right to do that to have regard to the changes which have taken place in our society and to provide for the taking of sensible decisions about proper resourcing of the work of these Houses. Taxpayers ought to reflect that parliamentary work is a great deal cheaper than the work we have seen taking place at different locations in the State over the last five years. That is Jim Mitchell's contribution, that we will have an Oireachtas Commission. He expressed some concern about the draft legislation when it first emerged, that there were changes and nuances in it that were not intended. It is a transaction that the House will get an opportunity to deal with.</P>
    <P>Jim Mitchell had the highest regard for our public service, especially our civil servants and their record of honesty and diligence, but he was adamant that not one line, not the cover of the DIRT report, would be written by the permanent or official government. He insisted it would be the work of parliamentarians to establish what parliament could do, separate from Government. That was a very considerable achievement. He has ensured that in the Library there is a permanent record of everything that transpired during that inquiry, including an audio-visual record of the actual hearings.</P>
    <P>It was typical of him that, shortly before he died, he wrote to me setting out how he saw the development of Irish politics now. He foresaw a <Col N="51" /> political landscape in which Sinn Féin would make that final step into democratic politics. He had some interesting things to say about the situation that confronts this polity and the neighbouring one. He would not be minded to follow some of the hares that are raised nowadays, he would be quite happy to see us all going forward with a ballot paper in one hand and a medical card in the other. It would not concern Jim Mitchell if we are all putting our shoulder to the collective democratic wheel.</P>
    <P>His most difficult period was in the run-up to the last general election. It is a salutary reminder for anybody who needs to be reminded of the transient affections of the media. Sections of the media who had earlier sought to deify him, sought to devour him in those weeks coming up to the general election. Notwithstanding the essentially decent instincts of most journalists, and of the journalists who cover this House, when the media is in full flight it is an awesome spectacle to behold but Jim Mitchell understood and knew that well. He was an especially courageous, committed politician who believed in public service and who left an everlasting contribution here.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to extend my sympathies to Patsy and the family, to Gay and the extended Mitchell family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach and, Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte in expressing my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to the Mitchell family, in particular, to Patsy Mitchell, her daughters, Aoife, Catríona and Sinéad, and her sons, Ruairí and Neil, and to Jim's wider family, especially his brother, Gay, who is a colleague in this House.</P>
      <P>By any standard, Jim Mitchell was an extraordinary politician. He was probably an extraordinary person. In so many respects he represented all that is best in the ordinary person because, notwithstanding his success and high profile, Jim never lost the run of himself. Deputy Rabbitte has spoken at length about his work on the Committee of Public Accounts. During those hearings I remember meeting him one evening going into Buswell's Hotel for a short break in the committee's proceedings and he was on crutches. It was evident he was in dreadful pain. It was impressive to see how committed and dedicated he was to the task at hand. I doubt if I have met many people who were as driven and as focused as Jim Mitchell. He had enormous energy even when very ill. The manner in which he dealt with his illness &ndash; the courage to which others have referred &ndash; and the dignity he showed when faced with a dreadful illness was incredible. Most people, faced with the same illness, probably would not have contested the last general election, but Jim Mitchell was not a quitter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sobering thought, notwithstanding the enormous, difficult task he had in that constitu<Col N="52" /> ency, all the hard work and the high profile and the great tributes paid to him after the DIRT inquiry, that even somebody like him lost his seat. I remember when the Dáil reassembled there were some high-profile losses and it was hard to imagine the Dáil without those people. It was certainly hard to imagine the Dáil without Jim Mitchell, just as it is difficult to believe that at such a young age he is no longer with us. He was fearless and courageous and spoke his mind. He was a &ldquo;Dub&rdquo; through and through. He was innovative in many respects and open to new ideas. He left school at 14, but continued with his education, completing his leaving certificate, and studied computer science at Trinity College. Had he not opted for politics and remained in Guinness I have no doubt he would have reached the top. He was so driven and energetic, and worked so hard with a high level of commitment that he would have got to the top of commercial life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>While he will probably be remembered most for his part in the DIRT inquiry, he has been in Leinster House since 1977. I came into the Seanad at that time. I will remember him most for his razor sharp questioning. He was one of the best questioners on the Opposition benches regardless of which Minister he questioned. He seems to have had responsibility for virtually every single portfolio that was ever invented. Jim had a great knowledge of public life and of policy issues from welfare to energy, communications, transport, finance, justice and so many other areas. He always appeared interested in moving on. He did not want to take a brief and stay with it, he wanted to move on and learn something new. He always cut to the chase in asking the questions. Certainly he was always conscious of the need to be as rough as they get in here when questioning and yet it was never personal. He probably said some of the toughest things about his political opponents but not for any other than the right motive. He saw that as the job at hand. He was a constant politician.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago he contacted me about a former constituent who was coming back for Christmas from Australia or New Zealand. He wanted to make sure that this person, whom he believed had a very good idea, would meet someone who would understand this good idea. He wanted to ensure a person at the appropriate level &ndash; not any junior person &ndash; in the organisation involved would see that individual. After he lost he seat, he contacted me about a constituency case. I mention those two items because he left no stone unturned in trying to look after former constituents. Having lost his seat in May he did not leave files aside and he never failed to help. That was an extraordinary fact even when he was very ill and had lost his seat.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, he had a great sense of humour and had great stories to tell. Although he enjoyed publicity as many do, he was still a very private person in many respects and he is a loss to his family. Patsy, in particular, and her <Col N="53" /> children will miss him so much. That a husband and a father should be taken away at such a young age is a huge burden for any family. Yet Jim was no stranger to losing. He lost his father when he was ten, and his sister, Anne, and his brother, Peter, in their forties from cancer. He knew what tragedy was about. I heard last week that he planned his funeral, which is extraordinary and must have taken enormous courage. I understand he did not want to burden his children, family or friends with organising the details of his funeral service. To the end he was thorough. We will all miss him. It is hard to believe we will not see him again.</P>
    <P>I sympathise in particular with his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party. He had strong views on parties and politics and was selfless when required to move constituency. He represented three different constituencies in the Dublin area, representing people from Clondalkin to East Wall, since 1977. He willingly made sacrifices when asked. He was credited with the election of Liam Skelly to this House in a famous by-election. Not only could he deliver a seat for himself and his running mate in normal times but even when not a candidate he seemed able to perform extraordinary electoral successes.</P>
    <P>To Patsy, the children and all his family I offer my sympathy. May he rest in peace. We will certainly miss him.</P>

      <P>Jim Mitchell led by example. We remember him as a tireless worker but his friendliness and generosity shine more for those of us who knew him. He was always positive. We know of his courage through his electoral battles and throughout his illness. I remember his great laugh more than anything. To hear his laugh in the car park of Leinster House would brighten the day. He was well liked by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I was struck by a point of view expressed outside Leinster House last Sunday by the parish priest in Skerries. He said that Jim Mitchell's death changed perceptibly people's view of politics because it was one of the few times people heard politicians, from all sides, speak sincerely, genuinely and affectionately about a lost colleague. The genuine regret at the loss of someone of the calibre of Jim Mitchell was so clear and public that it made people notice that regardless of politics there is genuine admiration between people in public life.</P>
      <P>Even in life Jim had a profound effect on people's view of politics. The DIRT inquiry impressed many of those who had given up on politics because they felt the Dáil was unaccountable, a charade and not worthy of the higher ideals of politics. In many ways Jim through his leadership turned that around. That is a legacy of which his family should be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" />I worked closely with Jim on the finance committee in 1992 and 1997. As Chairman he showed charisma and decisiveness. One could not but like him regardless of whether one agreed or disagreed with him. The Tánaiste said that he organised his own funeral. Clearly he saved others trouble if he could and was there to take on the burdens of life. The ultimate statement was that his funeral was on budget day. It may seem to many that if he could have organised it that way he would have. It was ironic given that he led the Fine Gael reply on budget day last year.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, for all his service and achievements, he was too young to die. As for many victims of cancer, his death is a reminder to us all to take stock. Jim would have been a great achiever for years to come. It is sad he is no longer with us. However, his work carries on. While we all miss him I hope we will be energised by his legacy and memory.

I wish to join in the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Deputy Mitchell, to his brother, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and to the Fine Gael Party on the death of Jim.</P>
      <P>Our political outlooks were different. His final term in the Dáil was my first. In the early stages of the first presence of an elected member of Sinn Féin here in the history of the House he was one of a small number of Deputies who extended warmth and a willingness to engage, to recognise the new reality and to encourage at all times. Not everyone took that position but that was Jim Mitchell's way. Despite the chasm in our respective outlooks he demonstrated the gift of preparedness to reach out to one of another view and to meet the challenges of a new political reality on this island.</P>
      <P>Jim Mitchell was a long-serving Member of this House and has deservedly earned the admiration and respect of people of all parties. I share that view of Deputy Mitchell. In my five years here I cannot remember him seeking to score a petty political point nor seeking to denigrate another elected Member. He was prepared to stand up for what he believed and to put that forward as the basis of his integrity and the reason he deserved support.</P>
      <P>The way he bore his pain in his final months, as only his wife, family and children can attest to, is something that must give comfort to others suffering from terminal illness. He was a shining light. He should be admired and respected not only by those in this Chamber but far beyond. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cur leis an méad atá ráite ag na Teachtaí a labhair romham. Ba fhear uasal, comráideach díograiseach é an iar-Theachta Jim Mitchell, a d'oibrigh i gcónaí d'Fhine Gael agus do na dáilcheanntair inar toghadh é. I found it easy to work with Jim Mitchell <Col N="55" /> when our constituencies first merged, joining Jim's home territory of Inchicore and Ballyfermot on the south side with the north docklands, Stoneybatter and the Navan Road districts in what was only one of the many changing faces of Dublin Central. Jim was no stranger to changing constituencies. He was always an incredibly hard working and committed representative of the people who elected him. While he believed strongly in his political ideals, he was always most friendly and welcoming towards other constituency representatives, including me. I valued his co-operative approach to constituency representation at all times. As other speakers have said, he was one of the most selfless politicians, never seeking to consolidate a political or electoral stronghold solely for himself. Instead, he worked primarily in the interests of his party, Fine Gael, and made many personal sacrifices in support of that party in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most lasting memory I will have of him was the occasion when he accompanied the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, to meet me at Summerhill Parade in the north inner city when I was first elected to Dáil Éireann in February 1982. He was not successful on that occasion in persuading me of what he believed to be the best course of action, despite correctly reminding me that it was he, as a member of Dublin Corporation in the mid 1970s, who first called for a programme of action to bring an end to the Dickensian tenement conditions of Dublin's north inner city, even though he did not represent that area at the time. After that encounter, he always remained supportive and friendly towards me and others who worked with me in the inner city. Often, he would jokingly argue &ndash; at least, I think it was jokingly &ndash; that we should all have been alongside him in Fine Gael. I have to say he was not successful on that count either.</P>
      <P>I always marvelled at his dynamism and energy at election time. In that respect, he was without parallel in my experience. I express my most sincere condolences to Jim's wife, Patsy, and their children, to Deputy Gay Mitchell and the extended Mitchell family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my sympathy to Jim Mitchell's wife, Patsy, and their children, to our colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell and to the Fine Gael Party. Jim was a man of great energy and full of life. I believe he would not wish us to bemoan his passing but rather to mark and celebrate the full life he had. He had a distinguished career as a public representative for over 30 years. At local authority level, his crowning achievement was his election as the youngest Lord Mayor in the history of Dublin. At national level, he served in many ministries and many Opposition portfolios. Perhaps his crowning achievement at that level was his chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee, particularly in <Col N="56" /> relation to the DIRT inquiry which he led with tremendous ability.</P>
      <P>I shared a constituency with him for ten years from 1992 to 2002. I found him a tough but fair opponent, always willing to give advice. He had an unerring ability to identify the issue of the day and to follow it. He was an outstanding canvasser on the doorsteps, right up to the very last days when his serious illness made it difficult for him. He will be a tremendous loss to Irish public life. He gave credibility to politics at a time when that credibility was being eroded. I believe his real legacy will be that he enhanced the role of the public representative, whom he saw as the parliamentarian elected by the people to hold all and sundry accountable to the people. We owe him a great deal. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my comments to the tributes which have been paid to Jim Mitchell. Like Deputy Costello, I shared a constituency with him. Before one even met Jim Mitchell on the campaign, one felt his presence in the constituency as something to be respected and feared. My first encounter with him was in 1992, to my detriment and loss. While canvassing in the vicinity of Nash Street, Inchicore, I realised that my campaign was not going very well. The subsequent tally figures confirmed that Fitzpatrick did not feature very highly in the Inchicore area of the then Dublin Central constituency.</P>
      <P>On a more serious note, I wish to pay tribute to the manner in which he dealt with his illness, even to the extent of fighting the last general election campaign when he was obviously under severe strain. To his wife, Patsy, and their family, to his brother, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and to the extended Mitchell family, I offer my commiserations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Jim Mitchell was a man of enormous energy and life force. It is very difficult to realise that he is dead. He was a phenomenon in politics. Those who were opposed to him learned to fear the Mitchell machine. The Mitchell machine existed because not only could Jim attract friends, he could keep them. Few others in public life could attract the loyalty and respect of such a huge circle of friends and associates, as was evidenced by the turnout at his funeral. Jim Mitchell was unique and those who flocked to him recognised his qualities. On the principle of judging people by the quality of their friends, Jim came out head and shoulders above others in the quality of the friends he attracted and kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who now enjoys the facility of cheap air travel in Europe should thank Jim Mitchell for that. As Minister responsible for that area in the 1980s, he pioneered the open skies approach from the Irish perspective. He had a deep respect for tradition, his religious faith and his roots. At the same time, he was a radical thinker right to the end. He was impatient to change things that needed to be changed. Above all, in private conversation, he showed enormous <Col N="57" /> pride in his family and their achievements. They should know that, in his associations here in Leinster House, he always thought of them. His wife, Patsy, and their family, his brother, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and the extended Mitchell family are a living tribute to Jim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In taking up where Deputy Bruton left off, much has been said of my brother's success in public life. He was equally successful in his private life. He and Patsy have raised an outstanding family. Though he spent a great deal of time in public life and put in long hours, he always found it possible to give precedence to his family and they are a great credit to him. Of all the testaments he leaves behind, his family is the greatest. I do not get many opportunities to say that it is a great privilege to be their uncle.</P>
      <P>My brother had a great sense of occasion which I do not think anyone else has mentioned. Whether at the age of 11 saying mass in my mother's front room &ndash; which he would insist on saying in Latin &ndash; as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, as Lord Mayor of Dublin or even in his planning of his own funeral, which was well done and not over the top, his sense of occasion was a contributing factor to his great sense of professionalism. We will look back in time at his good humour. He saw us through some difficult times with his good humour and his ability to be a prankster on all sorts of occasions whether to do with a constituent or a head of Government or of state and, as a family, that is what we will remember of him.</P>
      <P>He also had a great sense of parliament &ndash; not just this one &ndash; but what parliament stands for generally. If there were no parliament, there would be a jungle outside this House. Sometimes, when people look at our failings as human beings, they forget that. Parliament itself replaces the jungle and creates order. It is then supposed to bring fairness and justice. If, as young boys, we could have looked forward to this sad time and he could have foreseen that the Parliament would interrupt its important proceedings in his honour, he would have been proud. We are proud and grateful. On behalf of Patsy, Rúairi, Sinéad, Neil, Aoife and Caitríona, on my own behalf and that of the Mitchell family, I thank the House for the tributes paid here today.</P>

      <P>Before adopting the proposals, I seek clarification from the Taoiseach in relation to Votes 29 and 35. Vote 29 is a Supplementary Estimate relating to third level and further education. I note from the proposal on the Order Paper for today that the provision is for the princely sum of &euro;1,000. What is the Government's intention in proposing a supplementary sum not exceeding &euro;1,000 in relation to the payment of sundry grants and grants-in-aid in respect of third level and further education? I know the situation is pathetic in terms of third level grants and for those attending the colleges. Is it possible that the proposition is to confine this to a sum no greater than &euro;1,000?</P>
      <P>On No. 35, I have no doubt that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism would be able to operate his office on a similar sum to the period 31 December but I am incredulous in relation to Vote No. 29 on third level education, particularly when we are looking at sums of &euro;47 million for first level and &euro;44 million for second level, so I seek clarification on the sums for both Votes.</P>

      <P>On Vote 29, a token supplementary is required for Vote 29 to third level and further education for technical accounting reasons. Some &euro;600,000 is needed for the Dublin Dental Hospital which is a grant-in-aid subhead, however there are sufficient overall savings in the Vote to meet this requirement. The &euro;1,000 is a technical means to vote the &euro;600,000 which is required but it is within savings of the Department so it does not require any more than that in the technical subhead.</P>

It is a grant aid sub-head but there are sufficient overall savings in the Vote to meet this requirement. The procedure that is always adopted when one is switching a sub-head or if one wants a requirement within a sub-head, is to put &euro;1,000 forward to be able to make the grant in aid sub-head available. In this case, &euro;0.6 million is being transferred within sub-heads to the Dublin Dental Hospital. However, because there is a sufficient saving, the mechanism they use is to put forward a technical sub-head of &euro;1,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That leave be given by the Dáil to introduce the following Supplementary Estimate for the service of the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2002: &ndash; Vote 31 &ndash; Agriculture and Food (<i>Supplementary Estimate</i>).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to present for the approval of the House a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;15 million for the Department of Agriculture and Food. Actual gross expenditure and appropriations-in-aid for the Department for 2002 are below the Estimates but were, until last week, projected to balance out within the original net Estimate. The shortfall which has now emerged relates to the final balancing payment of &euro;34.2 million, due from the EU in respect of 1994-99 round of Structural Funds. It had been anticipated that this payment would be received before the end of this year. However, it has now been confirmed by the European Commission that this will not be possible.</P>
      <P>My Department has examined options to try to minimise the effect of this on the Vote. While offsetting measures to compensate for part of the shortfall had been identified it has not proven possible to make up the full &euro;34.2 million. In the circumstances, to avoid an excess Vote, I propose to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;15 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is due to an expected shortfall in the receipts rather than an increase in expenditure in my Department. In fact, gross expenditure by my Department in 2002 is expected to be &euro;65 million lower than the <Col N="68" /> Revised Book of Estimates, although there will be increased expenditure under a number of subheads, in particular, A1, C3, J1 and L2. The increased expenditure on subhead A1 results from additional travel and overtime costs resulting from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001 and also additional BSE sampling. With regard to subhead C3, the original Estimate of &euro;136 million has proven to be insufficient and in additional expenditure has been incurred in compensation for BSE herd depopulation, BSE testing and the scrapie eradication programme. The latter scheme is now expected to cost &euro;12 million this year. The original Estimate only provided a &euro;1.6 million for subhead J1, which covers legal fees expenses, but additional expenditure has been incurred as a result of the settlement of a number of court cases.</P>
    <P>This additional expenditure is more than counter-balanced by lower than estimated spending on some of the subheads, most notably subhead L1 which covers market intervention, subhead L4, which covers REPS, L5 which covers the early retirement scheme and M2, the on-farm investment schemes. The savings on L1 reflect the significant improvement in the beef market this year compared to 2001, largely because of a strong recovery in consumer confidence in beef arising from the various safeguards for consumers which were introduced at EU level following the BSE crisis of 200 and 2001. In particular, very little beef was sold into the special purchase scheme which was co-funded by the EU and the national Exchequer, or indeed into intervention.</P>
    <P>With regard to subheads L4, L5 and M2, applications for these schemes have been lower than expected with a result that expenditure on these measures is likely to fall short of earlier projections. Nevertheless, the level of REPS applications continues to compare favourably with any corresponding period during the first REPS scheme from 1994-99. Notwithstanding this, I have made some administrative changes to the scheme to address the complexity of the application procedures and these changes, which will come into effect in January 2003, will make the application process easier for farmers and producers. Lower expenditure on these schemes, which are co-financed by the EU, has resulted in lower receipts from the EU. Some, but not all, of this has been offset by additional drawdowns in other areas such as compensatory allowances and from the veterinary fund.</P>
    <P>Despite these variations in expenditure and receipts, my Department had expected until last week to bring in net expenditure within the provision on the Book of Estimates. However, within the past week my Department has been made aware by the Commission that the final payment for the OPARDF and food programme under the 1994-99 round of the Structural Funds, amounting to &euro;34.2, will not be paid before the end of the year. Ireland is not alone in this situation and I believe that most of the programmes from the <Col N="69" /> other member states have not yet been closed. We are not faced with a refusal to pay the outstanding sum, merely a delay in payment until the internal Commission procedures have been completed.</P>
    <P>My Department has examined various options to minimise the effect on the outturn of the non-receipt of the outstanding &euro;34 million. On the expenditure side, for example, I indicated earlier that I expect savings on intervention, REPS, the early retirement scheme and the NDP on-farm investment schemes.</P>
    <P>Turning to the table in section two (II) of the Supplementary Estimate it can be seen that overall it shows above-Estimate expenditure on subheads A1, C3, J1 and L2 totalling &euro;58.284 million, appropriations-in-aid which are below Estimates, totalling &euro;80.121 million and below-Estimate expenditure on subheads L1, L4, L5 and M2 totalling &euro;123.405 million.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this is that we are &euro;15 million short of what is required this year. I again stress that this would not have arisen if we had, as expected, received the final EU co-funding for the 1994-99 round of Structural Funds. The need for this Supplementary Estimate stems from non-receipt of these EU funds. The adoption of a Supplementary Estimate is the most appropriate way to deal with the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will support this amendment, but there are some issues on which we will seek clarification during Question Time. It is appropriate to have this Estimate because it gives us an opportunity to point out that preliminary figures published by the CSO indicate that farm incomes will decrease by 8.5% this year. We all talk about benchmarking and inflation but what profession would accept a decrease of 8.5% in its income? There has been a rise in direct payments this year of &euro;237 million. However, the decrease is due to the decrease in the price of commodities. Grain is down by 13%, milk by 8%, sheep by 16% and pigs by 12%. Beef has stayed constant but is coming from a very low base. Direct payments make up 68% of farm incomes this year. The Minister made an address last year on CAP reform but I do not know what the Government is doing for the future of agriculture. From a survey carried out it seems that 40% of members of Teagasc feel that incomes will not rise, 20% or 30% say they will stay the same and only 9% believe they will increase. I do not know what hope or future the Minister can give farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates have been very poor for agriculture and have been followed by a very poor budget. In the budget debate the Taoiseach did not mention agriculture. This reflected the non-commitment of the Government to the agricultural community. In the budget there is one very important issue in relation to roll-over relief. I am surprised the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, allowed this through. Perhaps he did not know about it, or does not <Col N="70" /> know about it today. I have to admire Fianna Fáil for putting this over on him. Has he no clout? He is getting the blame for this being buried, on the basis that he drew up the programme with the NRA with respect to disposal of land to try to make things easy for it, and roll-over relief is then abolished under his nose. He was out on the plinth welcoming the budget and saying it is a good budget. In fairness to him, I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he did not know what was in it or did not understand it. However, I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will do something to get an exemption for farmers because he must realise the importance of roll-over relief.</P>
    <P>Stock relief was not mentioned in the budget. I do not know whether it was omitted inadvertently, or whether it will be put in as a sweetener. It is not something major but it should be included. We will bring forward a proposal to extend it from December of this year for another three-year period. A great opportunity was missed by not putting some tax incentives in place to encourage leasing of land. As the Minister is well aware, one of the difficulties in agriculture is structural, relating to the availability of land. There is no incentive at the moment for people to give their under-utilised land to farmers who want to expand, even though it would not ultimately cost the Exchequer any money.</P>
    <P>Doubling of the disease eradication levy is a bone of contention within the farming community. Perhaps during Question Time the Minister will outline whether that must come before the House before being passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been involved in the beef summit in recent days, a good tactical ploy to take the heat off himself. Unfortunately, he is a few months too late, as most of the cattle have been sold for this year. Following the McKinsey report we had the report of the Beef Task Force which was published in June 1999. It recommends rationalisation of the beef industry, talks about waste management and the disposal of specified risk material, and advocates an agreement on a greater degree of price transparency. This is particularly important given that it is reported in the media today that &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; intends to broadcast a programme tonight which may indicate that there was a price cartel with regard to the milk industry. There is anecdotal evidence to that effect, and farming organisations have always claimed that it may be the case in regard to other agricultural products. What is most amazing is the reference to a three-month time frame for the implementation of the task force recommendations. I do not know whether that is a typographical error. Perhaps the Minister would tell me whether there was a three-month time frame for the implementation of the recommendations of the June 1999 task force which was chaired by the current Secretary General of the Department who, I assume, was Secretary General at the time.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Estimates, it is extraordinary that the EU has not come up with the &euro;34.5 <Col N="71" /> million and that we must now draw down &euro;15 million from the Department of Finance. I note the savings on market intervention, REPS, early retirement, the national development plan, all areas that are vitally important to the sustainability of agriculture. If and when this &euro;34 million is allocated, the Minister should put it into a scheme for young farmers and not let the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, take it back from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposed increase in the Estimates of &euro;15 million. However, it is unfortunate that the &euro;34 million has not been delivered on time. In his Budget Statement or in a press release, the Minister pointed out that there is a certain comfort zone in the EU funding and that there are issues in the budget that are not addressed concerning EU funds, and this kind of shortfall at this time of the year is most unfortunate. However, we will support the increase in the Estimates of &euro;15 million and look on the positive side.</P>
      <P>There was nothing but bad news for farming in the Estimates and in the budget. The recent reduction in the allocation is further bad news. The cuts in agriculture for the coming year are also considered to be disproportionate to cuts in other Departments.</P>
      <P>The past two years have been very difficult for farming. There were certain events over which nobody had any control. Foot and mouth disease was one of those, along with the bad weather during the summer which made farming extremely difficult. We must also be mindful of the low baseline spending in those two years. We must ensure that it does not become the norm and that the slow-down in on-farm investment arising from that does not continue because the reference points have remained static in the past and the unusual conditions were not taken into account.</P>
      <P>In regard to the on-farm investment measures of the first three years of the national development plan, there has been substantial under-spending. It is critical that under-spending should be rescheduled for the remaining four years. On-farm schemes for waste management, dairy hygiene, and young farmers' installation aid must be protected. We must also take account of the coming on stream of the EU Nitrates Directive which must be implemented. It will be expensive, but we will suffer if we do not implement it and account must be taken of that. It is very important that environmental issues be addressed.</P>
      <P>I cannot entirely agree with the Minister's view that a relatively positive outlook for control of animal disease should lead to expenditure reductions in the coming year, but it is an issue I will raise again. I am every bit as anxious as the Minister to see the end of the curse of BSE here. However, recent comments that the trends are positive cannot be sustained, given the trend data. I will raise that issue again in another forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" />It is also of some concern to me, relative to the 2003 Estimates, that testing in the meat factories will be reduced. Given a report in one of today's newspapers about the detection of SRM in some of our meat exports to the UK it is a matter of some concern that the inspectorate is maintained and sustained and that we move forward in that direction rather than cutting back. Opening and extending our markets abroad is of crucial importance. We will do that only with best practice and that can be delivered only by improving the quality of our products. That is an issue I have spoken on many times with the Minister and I will come back to it.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the projections in the budget for Teagasc being cut in the coming year, which implies that the research area is likely to suffer. The outcome is that, on the basis of the principle of last in first out, young people, those who are perhaps on contract, are likely to be the people who will suffer. What I see as a result of that is the beginning of another brain drain. Those people have been very highly educated, and the probability is that they are the people who will be forced to emigrate if those kinds of cuts take place.</P>
    <P>I will comment on something Deputy Timmins said, which is of some interest today. Historically farmers have been at risk from the Competition Authority, or that is how it has been seen, if they combined to enhance their bargaining power. It is ironic that the large industrial and commercial enterprises seem to be immune until such time as &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; has got its hands on the data with a view to getting to grips with a spot of what appears to be price fixing by some of these industries. Farmers seem to be more at risk from the Competition Authority. I suppose the bottom line now is that if farming as a full time profession is to be protected, there must be an assurance of an acceptable income in line with the general incomes in the economy, and there must also be scope for reinvestment and development. The cuts already identified are more severe than in many other Departments and any additional cuts now will drive farmers over the margins and out of business completely.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I welcome this Estimate of &euro;15 million while at the same time regretting that we are at this point considering the shortfall of &euro;34.3 due from the European Union in respect of the 1994-99 round of Structural Funds. It is important that we do not lose out in terms of EU funding, but also that we do not let slip the progress that is needed in terms of the rural environmental protection scheme, area aid, early retirement and the other aspects that are to be covered by the Estimate. I understand that the Commission has made queries about the levels of inspection and it is important that we learn the lessons in that regard. We <Col N="73" /> should have learned a long time ago that there is no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to the European Union, as the regulations and standards we have to meet do not allow for a suspicion of corners being cut. If there is doubt on the part of the European Commission, there is a risk that funding will not be made available. I hope that such doubts can be quickly dispelled and that there will not be further difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I welcome the &euro;15 million being provided in this Supplementary Estimate, even if it is less than what was expected. The Department will have to introduce further such measures to compensate for the deficiencies which have become apparent as a consequence of the cuts in most areas under the Department's responsibility. The drastic effects of funding cuts for the coming year have already been pointed out and this Supplementary Estimate will not compensate for them. It will not address the crisis in farming, which is clear when one considers that there has been a decline of 8.5% in farm incomes. It will not aid the modernisation of farms or the transfer of farms to young, skilled farmers and it will not compensate for the negative effects of the cuts outlined in the Estimates.</P>
      <P>It is to be hoped that the Department will increase the funding available for certain programmes. This may be forced on the Government by public pressure and the effects of the crisis in farming communities. The State should not attempt to direct such an important aspect of its economic life in the manner it is following at present. There have been detrimental effects in isolated and rural communities, particularly in the west and south-west. I hope that moneys will be found to compensate for the reductions I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen" hpid="Mr. J. Breen Mr. J. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the great work he did last year when foot and mouth disease was kept out of Ireland. I am afraid that he seems to have forgotten about small farmers this year, however. I am a small farmer and I know that farm incomes have decreased dramatically. In the west of Ireland, people who cannot afford to farm their land are planting it. If land reclamation grants were made available, small farmers would be helped to bring their land to a higher standard of productivity. A combination of a lack of Government funding and the low incomes experienced in the farming sector means that farmers cannot afford to improve their lands in such a manner. It may not be in the brief of the Minister, Deputy Walsh, but I am concerned about persons who decide to plant their land to gain money. If the land all around a farmer is planted, he or she may be told that he or she cannot plant his or her land due to a high level of alkalinity. Where is the sense in penalising one particular farmer, if the surrounding land that was planted was similarly unsuitable? Will the Minister consider a compensation <Col N="74" /> scheme for farmers who are not allowed to plant their land?</P>
      <P>Similarly, I ask him to assess the possibility of a land reclamation grant scheme. All sorts of grant payments can be received from the EU, but there is no grant similar to that I received from the Department some years ago when I could not afford to drain or reclaim my land. It was an encouragement and an incentive for small farmers. If the Minister does not take action in relation to these matters, the flight from the land will continue. There will be nothing but ranchers in this country and small farmers like me will be gone. I appeal to the Minister to consider the reintroduction of land reclamation grants for small farmers in the west of Ireland. I emphasise that such grants are very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the &euro;15 million being allocated in this Supplementary Estimate, but there is a greater shortfall at a time when farming is going through one of the greatest crises in the history of the State. In addition to the doubling in the disease levy, we have seen problems with milk prices this year. The income of a farmer producing 40,000 gallons of milk, or 182,000 litres, will decrease by about &euro;10,200. The Central Statistics Office has said that the price of milk has dropped by 10.1%. It is a serious situation. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, who comes from the west of County Cork &ndash; there is very intensive farming in east Cork and marginal farming in west Cork &ndash; to address these problems. Deputies should not doubt that the agriculture industry cannot survive if the difficulties continue.</P>
      <P>There are many issues at stake. The Department has addressed many animal diseases, but what about Johne's disease and BVD, which are related to the importation of animals into Ireland? As farmers, we have to cope with a substantial share of imports, beyond that which is fair. No levies are paid on beef coming here to compete with Irish beef in supermarkets and on butchers' shelves. I am not opposed to imports, but I believe we are getting more than our fair share and I ask that action be taken. I will have no hesitation in naming those who are importing if I have to do so, as some of them are involved in big business. Two major farms, with a total area of 600 acres, were leased by Teagasc in my area last year at a time when agriculture is contracting and Teagasc is expanding in the commercial area of farming. It is not in order and should be examined and addressed. We are taking &euro;17 million from the other activities of Teagasc, even though farmers need more and more help in the advisory area, rather than in the research area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not get as many opportunities to speak about agriculture and certain other issues in the House as we did in the past. Many debates are now restricted, including the budget debate. As a <Col N="75" /> member of Fianna Fáil, a Government party that has always stood by the farming community and that has developed farming to its present state, I can inform the House that a great disillusionment and despondency is developing in rural Ireland. People are running from the land. Deputy James Breen spoke about ranchers in his part of the country, but ranchers do not even want farm land as farming is a serious business. I appeal to the Minister to recognise that farmers cannot take a twofold increase in the milk disease levy, as well as the new BSE levy. I have discussed this serious issue, but I am disappointed with the Deputies opposite who seem to be out of touch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a lengthy speech, but to make a few short points. I agree with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe that it seems that nobody is interested in agriculture anymore. Young people have no interest in farming as it is too hard a way of life. The Minister will agree that farm incomes are poor. Since 1997, the number of young people entering the farming profession each year has decreased by 60%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a significant and amazing decrease and Deputy O'Keeffe was right to raise it. Can I ask the Minister to assure the House that the need to introduce this Supplementary Estimate does not result from the actions of his Department? Do the problems lie at European Union level? The Minister received major publicity in recent weeks as a result of his participation in round table discussions. Can the Minister provide an assurance that the farmers will benefit and not the beef barons or the owners of the meat factories, who have been making huge profits over the last number of years? If this round table discussion is to achieve anything the Minister must make sure that the beef producers, who are running from the land, will actually benefit from them.</P>
      <P>Despite what Deputy O'Keeffe said, Teagasc has a huge role to play in agriculture and it should not be undermined. Reports in today's newspapers state there is a shortage of funding. Can the Minister give us an assurance that Teagasc will be put on a sound financial footing to take us into the years ahead? If the advisory body supporting the whole agricultural industry is not on a sound footing it cannot do its research. A change has taken place in farming.</P>

      <P>The Minster said in his statement that numbers of applications for the rural environmental protection scheme had been lower than expected but compared favourably with the corresponding period of 1994-99. The predictions for 2002 were obviously much higher. From what the Minister said, I assume that much of this relates to the bureaucracy and red tape involved. Will some of this be taken out of the system to <Col N="76" /> make life easier for those who want to apply for and avail of the scheme?</P>

Was this issue raised with Commissioner Fischler when he was here, and what was the outcome, or has it developed in the meantime? Is the Minister mindful of the need for land acquisition for capital projects to be paid for in land swaps rather than CPOs? Capital gains measures are eating away at the money available for the purchase of replacement land. Can he address this matter, which is putting farmers out of business?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that when he was in Opposition and his leader requested Government time for a debate on agriculture, the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, allowed time for the debate? I agree with Deputy Ned O'Keeffe that not enough time is given to agriculture and I ask him to use his influence with the Minister and his special relationship with the Taoiseach to obtain Government time for a debate on agriculture. The beef barons and cattle rustlers are dictating agricultural policy. Hundreds of thousands of small farmers, as well as people like Deputy Breen, are suffering because they are being manipulated and bled dry by the industry. Does the Minister agree that although we have a concentration of economic power, the producer's margins are decreasing all the time and he is being trampled into the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister believe we are getting value for money with our TB eradication scheme? We have spent hundreds of millions on these schemes. I do not have to hand the exact number of reactors, but it does not seem to be slowing down. It is an industry in itself and I am worried that it is self-perpetuating. What are the Minister's views? I also want to know our current policy on scrapie. Back when money was falling out of the sky we were putting down flocks of sheep at every turn. One was found in the Curragh and the whole thing came to a standstill. Where do we stand? Appropriations-in-aid receipts are down by &euro;80 million. Is there any glaring reason <Col N="77" /> for this? I do not know whether the Minister has signed an order on intramammaries but if he has not I ask him to hold off until we can discuss the matter in committee.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy O'Keeffe to use his influence and his special Corkonian relationship with the Minister and the Taoiseach to get Government time so that he can articulate his point of view. He should concentrate his firepower on the Minister and the Government and not attack the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to this very brief debate. We will have a more extended debate tomorrow in the committee and I will be very glad of the opportunity to discuss more fully the general Vote on agriculture. We will also have further questions on agriculture before we go into recess.</P>
      <P>In relation to the shortfall, the Department made its application for funding on 20 August and has pursued it at the very highest level since then. The Commission, however, works relatively slowly, making sure that everything is absolutely perfect. It will pay, but not before the end of this financial year. That is why we needed this short-term, technical Supplementary Estimate to tide us over. We did not want to leave people unpaid coming up to the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timmins mentioned that this year was difficult for farming. It has been, in terms of the market and returns for various farming enterprises, and the weather has been dreadful also. The CSO's figures say that incomes were down by 8.5% and in some cases they are probably down by more. I have the greatest sympathy for farmers, who have shown tremendous resilience over the years. Despite the fact that they now have better technology on farms, this has been a bad year by any standards. There is a substantial amount of support for farming &ndash; total expenditure in support of farming is estimated at &euro;2.8 billion for the coming year. As Deputy Upton said, a big part of that comes from Europe &ndash; about &euro;1.6 billion.</P>
      <P>The subject of disease levies is on the agenda for our meeting tomorrow and we can go into it more deeply then. Deputy Timmins raised a whole range of matters, including the efficacy of the TB eradication programme. We have white country status internationally and can trade in over 60 countries because there is confidence in our system. A monitoring committee was established in 1999, following the report of the task force on beef, to ensure a number of matters were attended to. As a result, prices from individual factories for individual grades are published every week in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting I attended yesterday focused on the markets and sought to ensure the 400,000 tonnes we export go to the upper end of the mar<Col N="78" /> ket. While this year we will double our exports of beef to Britain, 75% of it will go to the lower end of the market with only 25% appearing on supermarket shelves. We want more at the higher end.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler proposed decoupling which must be negotiated over the next year. We have asked for a study of its impact. One study already undertaken suggests that livestock value would decrease by 35% causing a negative knock-on effect in the processing industry. This must be taken into account. Some farmers, however, would welcome decoupling. They would get support and area based payments and not have to fatten livestock at a loss. We must remember the overall industry.</P>
    <P>I will be in discussions with the Minister for Finance as to how best we can spend the money for young farmers next year.</P>

      <P>There is much interest in and expertise on scrapie and BSE in the House. The full facts of scrapie are not known yet, but as new information becomes available, we will examine and be influenced by it. Deputy Upton mentioned BSE in which the trends are still positive. From September 2001 to November 2002 the number of cases decreased by one third while the age profile went in the right direction. There was an isolated case in County Limerick two weeks ago about which the media became hysterical. We have since had some minor difficulties in some of our markets, but they still have confidence in our system. In 2002 less than 2% of cases were in cattle less than six years of age at times of diagnosis compared with 16% in 2001 and 40% in 2000.</P>

      <P>For the period August to November the number of cases was down by one third.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ned O'Keeffe expressed concern about Johne's disease, BVD and the lack of disease levies on imports. There are imports. We are part of the Single Market and trade worldwide, exporting 500,000 tonnes of beef and importing only 12,000 tonnes. We cannot expect to trade externally without any import trade. I can assure consumers, however, that food coming into Ireland is of the highest standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hayes mentioned the need for more young people to enter agriculture. For those interested, there is young farmer installation aid and the farm retirement scheme. In spite of the criticism of cutbacks in the budget, we extended stamp duty of 9% for a further three years, a major encouragement for young people to enter agriculture. Despite negative talk about people running from the land, there has been an increase in the number entering agricultural college this year for the first time in a long time. It is not the <Col N="79" /> Department's fault that the money has not yet been paid. Teagasc does a good job. It is essential for the support of the industry with the advice it provides and research and development it conducts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris expressed concern about afforestation, a worthwhile enterprise in the long-term. I am pleased to see that we are processing more of the product in Ireland. I can remember seeing the raw material being exported from the quays in Cork and Dublin to Scandinavia for processing. It is a pity we do not do more processing for paper and other products.</P>
    <P>We have increased compensatory headage payments for small farmers to over &euro;200 million per annum, helping farmers in the west. There have also been increases in the farm assist scheme. Those who are on a small income should make more use of the farm assist scheme, operated by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton mentioned REPS and the EU nitrates directive, which must be implemented. Further reductions in bureaucracy and red tape and greater participation in REPS are vital. Concerns about capital gains tax are a matter for the Department of Finance. Its regulations must be complied with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris raised the issue of a possible cartel in the beef industry. Three other wise men looked into the matter for some time and produced a report which, although it makes interesting reading, did not agree with the perception that there is a cartel in the industry.</P>
    <P>While live exports have increased to 120,000 head per year, they will not increase to the levels of over 400,000 head per annum experienced two years ago because of diseases in live animals and animal welfare considerations. There are concerns in Europe about the length of journey live animals have to undertake. For competitive reasons, however, it is an important outlet.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Molaim, arís, an Bille a bheith léite don darna uair. Mar adúirt mé, is é mo chéad uair mar Aire sinsearach Bille a chur os comhair na Dála agus tá lúcháir orm é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>This Bill is one of two Bills intended to implement the social welfare package announced in the recent budget. This year's social welfare package amounts to &euro;530 million and represents 40% of the total budget allocation of &euro;1.3 billion. It is a reflection of the Government's priority to protect the living standards of social welfare recipients at a time when difficult decisions had to be made with regard to the management of public finances. Since the Government took office in 1997, Ireland has changed dramatically for the better. The number of people at work has risen by 400,000 to 1.8 million. The rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10.3% to 4.6%. The number of people in long-term unemployment has dropped from 90,000 to 22,000. Social welfare spending rose by over &euro;3.5 billion between 1997 and 2002, well in excess of the rate of inflation. Payment rates for both recipients and their families have improved considerably in real terms. Between 1997 and 2002, we increased the main payment amount for a pensioner couple by 50%.</P>
      <P>Real improvements in social welfare in recent years have led to a halving of the consistent poverty measure. In 1994, the level of consistent poverty was 15.1% and this was reduced to 6% in 2000, the latest year for which figures are available. However, the Government is most anxious to protect the weak and vulnerable in our society and to safeguard the gains made in building social inclusion. We are delivering an additional &euro;833 million in social welfare spending next year, bringing the projected level of spending to over &euro;10 billion for the first time. Social welfare expenditure in 2003 will be &euro;4.5 billion higher than it was in 1997, an increase of almost 80%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the social welfare package are to increase or maintain the value of all rates of payment in real terms; give additional increases to those aged 66 and over, in particular those on widows and old age pension; continue to increase pensions in line with the programme for Government commitment to increase the State pension to &euro;200 by 2007; increase or maintain the <Col N="81" /> real value of all qualified adult rates of payment and to ensure they do not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate and to make significant progress in our programme of increases in the level of child benefit. I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill provide for an increase of &euro;10 per week in the personal rates of old age, retirement and invalidity pensions for those aged over 65. This will bring the rate of old age contributory pension to &euro;157.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to &euro;144 per week. This confirms our commitment to pensioners and marks a substantial first step in implementing our intention announced in the programme for Government to increase the State pension to &euro;200 per week. In overall terms, it represents an increase of 59% over the rate payable in 1997, well ahead of the increase in inflation. In 2000, we gave a commitment to increase the widow's and widower's contributory pension for those over 66 to the full old age contributory pension. I am pleased to say that the special increase of &euro;11 for this category, provided for in section 2, will bring the new rate to &euro;155.80, within &euro;1.50 of the full old age contributory rates.</P>
    <P>The Government is also conscious of the needs of other vulnerable groups in our society, particularly those who provide a caring role, widowers and those on invalidity pension. Accordingly, we are providing for an increase of &euro;7 in the personal rates of these payments. This will bring the standard personal rates of invalidity and widow's or widower's pensions to &euro;130.30 for a pensioner under age 65 and the rate of carer's allowance to &euro;129.60 under age 66.</P>
    <P>We are also committed to protecting the real value of other social welfare payments. Over the period from 1997, general social welfare increases have increased well ahead of inflation and ahead of average earnings. In this budget, we are maintaining the value of these payments in line with inflation by providing an increase of &euro;6 per week in the personal weekly rate of disability and unemployment payments, one-parent family payments, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist. We are also providing for further increases of &euro;7.70 per week for qualified adults aged 66 and over of contributory pensioners with proportionate amounts for those on reduced payments. A pensioner couple on a full social welfare payment will, therefore, get an increase of &euro;17.70 per week. The qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 has risen from 72% of the old age contributory pension in 1997 to 77% in 2003, and now represents 84% of the old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>As promised in the programme for Government, this will be increased in the coming years to the full old age non-contributory pension rate to benefit women in the home who do not qualify in their own right for the contributory pension. Other qualified adult allowances are being maintained in line with increases in the relevant personal rates. The increases in these allowances are <Col N="82" /> as follows: &euro;6.70 per week for old age non-contributory pensions where the qualified adult is aged under or over 66 and for contributory pensions where he or she is aged under 66; &euro;5 per week for invalidity pension where the qualified adult is under 66; &euro;4 per week for all other qualified adult payments and proportionate increases will be applied where persons are in receipt of reduced rate QAA payments.</P>
    <P>Now that the tax year has moved to the beginning of January, the budget increases will again become payable from the first pay day in January. People receiving short-term payments such as unemployment payments will receive their increases immediately in the first week in January. In the case of certain people on long-term payments such as pensions, because of the time needed to print and distribute pension books, pensioners will receive their increases in arrears somewhat later.</P>
    <P>However, those who receive long-term payment by means of electronic payment, some 130,000, through a post office or bank will, this year, receive their increases on the first pay day in January. Some 235,000 people, mainly widows and widowers, one-parent families, invalidity pensioners and persons receiving carer's allowance, will receive a lump sum arrears payment for six weeks of the budget increases in mid-February. This will be included in their new order books effective from that date. For example, a widow on a contributory pension over 66 years of age will receive a back-dated payment of &euro;66. A further 262,000 recipients who are due to get their order books in April will receive a special payment in mid-February comprising six weeks arrears of the budget increase and seven weeks' advance payment. For example, a pensioner couple over age 66 will receive a lump sum payment of &euro;260 in mid-February.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill increases the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement from January next by &euro;17 per week. This will lead to a net gain of &euro;10.20 per week in the average FIS family payment. These increased payments will be paid immediately in the first week in January next. Sections 5 and 6 provide for an increase in the earnings ceiling from &euro;38,740 to &euro;40,420 per year for employees' social insurance (PRSI) contribution and the income ceiling for payment of optional contributions. Section 6 of the Bill also provides for a restructuring of the rate of optional contributions payable by share-fishermen. The standard rate of contribution is being reduced from 5% to 4% and the minimum flat rate contribution is being reduced from &euro;253 to &euro;200 per annum. In addition, the PRSI-free allowance is being increased from &euro;1,321 to &euro;2,500 per annum. These changes reflect reductions already made in recent years for most other PRSI contributors.</P>
    <P>This Social Welfare Bill, the first of two instalments, builds on the progress made in social inclusion areas by the Government in recent years. It safeguards the living standards of those <Col N="83" /> who rely on social welfare and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion in my name and that of my Fine Gael colleagues. We thought a lot about this motion before bringing it to the House. It is a recognition of the poor state of primary school education. From school buildings to <Col N="84" /> the provision of qualified teachers to the care of disadvantaged people, this Government has failed spectacularly.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government drawn up close to six months ago commits the Government to a continued reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio. The Government promised to introduce maximum class guidelines to ensure the average size of classes for children under nine is below the international best practice guideline of 20:1. The reality is very different. Between 10% and 20% of primary school pupils are in classes that meet Government targets. However, the average class size is 29 pupils with up to 35 in some classes. Despite a recent OECD report showing a pupil teacher rate of 21:1, the reality for many children in Ireland is different. The Department of Education and Science's statistics, and those of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, show that 125,000 primary school children are in classes of 30 or more. Some 250,000 children are in classes ranging in size from 20 to 29.</P>
      <P>The curriculum has changed immensely over the years and the demands on teachers are increasing. The face of classrooms has changed immeasurably also. Classes have pupils of different ability and different needs, who speak different languages and for whom English is a second language. Never has it been more necessary to reduce class sizes. Children need to be in classes of no more than 20 to maximise their potential. In light of the Government's and Minister's statistics the potential of only between 10% and 20% of children is being maximised. Between 80% and 90% of children are failing to reach their full potential because of the actions of this Government. There is nowhere the Government can hide from that statistic as it is based on the Department's figures.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science is not in the House but am sure that he will attend at some point in the debate. In his first words in this House following his appointment, the Minister pledged his commitment to tackling educational disadvantage. One of the first cuts made by the same Minister was in the area of disadvantage &ndash; needless to say the cuts were not announced in the House as that would be too much to expect. His very words were: &ldquo;The focus of my tenure as Minister will be on tackling education disadvantage and looking after those who are not very vocal.&rdquo;  He then slashed &euro;11 million from planned initiatives to reduce school drop-out rates and to attract students from disadvantaged backgrounds to third level education &ndash; that is some commitment.</P>
      <P>The education system is failing many students, particularly those who leave school at an early age. Instead of targeting, assisting and encouraging these students to stay within the education system this Government boldly turned its back on them. This Government's ability to cherish all the children of the nation equally is questionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on the forum on disadvantage highlights clearly the importance of support at an <Col N="85" /> early age to allow these children to benefit from education. Does the Minister understand the reality of educational disadvantage? Children in disadvantaged areas have a one in three chance of under-achievement and early drop-out, leading to a bleak future of poverty, social exclusion and unemployment. They are coming to school cold, hungry, malnourished and without warm clothes and returning home in the same condition. What hope or chance is the Government giving them? It is giving a future the same as the present, without any hope of a way out. The Minister now seems to have decided that third level students, and not his Department, are responsible for these children and their education.</P>
    <P>The failure to retain teachers in primary schools in disadvantaged areas is a failure of this Government and it is with it that responsibility rests. It is because this issue has been ignored for so long that it has now come to this sorry pass. The Minister will not get away with passing the responsibility for retaining these teachers onto third level students. His statement that the only way to keep teachers in disadvantaged schools is to pay bonuses, and the only way to raise this money is to re-introduce third level fees, was the most cynical move of this Government to date, not to mention being contrary to the Minister's much lauded notion of ring-fencing for third level funding, if charges are re-introduced. It is this Government which has presided over a spectacular failure to keep teachers in disadvantaged schools and it is its problem, not that of third level students, to sort out.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government to doing that is questionable in light of last week's budget. Funding for running costs in schools has been cut back in real terms and the Government is capping numbers in the public service. Can the Government guarantee that this area will not be hit? Every Minister seems to have guaranteed that his or her area will not be hit but some area has to be hit. We need to know which areas are involved. I have no faith that this will not interfere with and affect disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>In disadvantaged and other schools, there are between 30,000 and 40,000 children taught by teachers without primary teaching qualifications. Only half of this shortfall in primary school teachers is made up by qualified secondary teachers. The other 15,000 to 20,000 are taught by unqualified people. School principals must spend their Saturdays and Sundays ringing around the local area to try to get somebody to come into a classroom. They will take almost anybody they can get in their desperation to have somebody in the classroom for Monday morning. It is a significant problem.</P>
    <P>All children are entitled to the basic requirement of a fully trained and qualified teacher. I accept that the Minister has made some attempt to increase the number of graduates, but more needs to be done. Giving children an equal chance is not possible without giving them an equal start. The Government is failing to do this. <Col N="86" /> Schools in disadvantaged areas are bearing the brunt of this failure.</P>
    <P>The most outrageous failure of this Government, the Department of Education and Science and the Minister is the crisis with regard to school buildings. It is a failure of the current Government and the previous Administration that has been in office since 1997. I would allow the Minister an exemption from responsibility for the appalling state of primary schools up to May of this year had he not been a member of the previous Administration, but he was. Every member of that Administration is collectively responsible for the state of primary schools and not one can shirk that, try as he or she might.</P>
    <P>The horror stories are real and cannot be exaggerated. I debated this on the Adjournment of the House last week and the reality is as I pointed out then. It is easy to see the truth behind the newspaper stories when one visits these schools. I can understand that the Minister might be slow to visit the schools because they do not provide quite the same photo opportunity for someone in his position as standing in front of a shining new school funded by a public private partnership. Those shining new schools are few and far between and are not the reality that most of our primary school students experience.</P>
    <P>Camross national school in County Laois is one example. It is described as cramped and higgledy-piggledy, with a tiny room serving as a staff room, principal's office, secretary's office, cleaning supply room, cupboard, kitchen, reception and meeting room. One little room does all that. There is no storage space or PE room. When the resource teacher is available to the school, she must travel down the road to use a cottage provided by the local community to teach. Children have to be brought up and down to that building for their time with the resource teacher. The school has had plans completed for a number of years, it received planning permission for work and, in 1998, it was estimated that it would take &euro;800,000 to provide a new school. Nothing has been done since and it will cost the Department of Education and Science a lot more to do the work four years later.</P>
    <P>New Ross CBS in Wexford has been trying to get a new school since 1973. The school is on three separate sites and some of the prefabs are 30 years old. At Gaelscoil Sáirséail in Limerick, one building was built in 1763. That is well over 200 years ago and it is quite unbelievable it is still used. The school is located on a split campus with no ventilation or natural light in most rooms, which are all smaller than recommended. There is one square yard of playground for every pupil.</P>
    <P>At Charleville national school in Tullamore, the conditions can only be described as disgraceful and disgusting. There is no other way of putting it. I have visited there on numerous occasions, announcements have been made now and then but the school is still in the same condition. It is horrible to have to visit it let alone to attend as a pupil or a teacher, day after day, with<Col N="87" /> out hope of amendment or provision of facilities. One could give examples from any county or constituency. Six months ago these schools thought they would finally see the promised land and that they would be saved from such deplorable conditions with the help of Government party candidates. Local newspapers and radio were filled with good news press releases. They were told the cheques were in the post and that they should not fear because their school was on the list. That turned out to be a work of fiction which will probably make the Christmas best-sellers list and which we, in this House, have been reading in recent months.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will tell me that Government expenditure in 2003 will be &euro;172.6 million and that 120 major capital projects in the primary sector have recently been completed or are under construction. How recently were they completed? When will the projects under construction be completed? The Minister will deny that the schools on the list were due to start construction and, therefore, they were not included in the 2002 construction programme. However, he must face the fact that that is not the impression the Government gave six months ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the plans to prioritise the schools building programme. We, in Fine Gael, said that should be done a long time ago. However, that is only part of the problem. Another part of the problem is the provision of funding. If the Minister prioritises this area, as he says he will in January, where will the schools be which are currently on the list? They do not know where they are on the list at present, but they want to know if they will be further down the list after prioritisation.</P>
    <P>I tabled 134 parliamentary questions to the Minister last week as a result of contacts I had received and research I had done in the area. The Minister's response was a disgrace. Every Member in the House is entitled to answers to parliamentary questions, but the answers I received to those questions were unacceptable. The Minister said I should consult the Department's website. I did that before I tabled the questions, but it did not provide any information. It did not tell me anything I did not know already. I asked the Minister when the work would commence, when he expected it to be completed and the length of delays due to the cut in the Estimates. He told me he would announce his expenditure proposals for primary school buildings in the new year and that it was not possible at this point to indicate when architectural planning or construction will commence. There are seven stages in the architectural planning process. I do not accept it is not possible to tell us where each school is on the list. They must be at some point in the architectural planning process. The Minister only needs to look at the file and give us the basic information. The schools and we, as Members of this House, are entitled to that information. I will continue to table those questions every week, which will keep <Col N="88" /> someone employed on a full-time basis, because I am entitled to the answers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the primary responsibility for health and safety in schools rests with the boards of management. That may be the case, but it is unfair to blame schools and boards of management for the state of schools. The majority of them are looking after schools to the best of their ability with the resources they have. However, they cannot cope with the work which must be done, particularly to old schools, with the resources they receive. I am sure I will be provided with a list of figures from 1997 to 2002, as is the usual response. However, it is time the Minister accepted that schools do not want a history lesson. They want to know where they stand in 2002 and when the work will commence. It is time the Minister and the Government realised their responsibilities and commitment to these schools. They should do their job and ensure that schools are improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Enright for sharing time with me. Children are the future of the human race. However, the Government does not recognise that core principle. The commitment given before the election about investment in schools has not been met. I know several schools in County Sligo, such as Riverstown national school. The cameras were out when the Minister for Finance visited it before the election. He said the contract would be awarded and the school would be built. However, it is not on the list. Other schools include Coolaney national school, Holywell national school in Tubbercurry, High Park school in west Sligo and Dromore West national school. The reduction in the fund means that &euro;3 million will be taken from the capital building programme in Sligo in 2003 and 2004.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough that 28% of children with special needs are not identified in time. They cannot be identified while there are inadequate schools. The core value of the 21st century is education. We are talking about equality. It is unfair that children must attend inadequate schools. There are up to 50 children in one classroom in Riverstown national school. It does not have sanitary or IT facilities and the playground surface is concrete. That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are told to look up the Department website for information. The Minister said that up to 400 schools are on the list. It is disgraceful that promises were made. The publication of the list is not any consolation. There must have been mismanagement because the money was wasted in many areas. Many national schools could have been upgraded in County Sligo. This is an important issue. It is unfair that parents and taxpayers, who expect equality of treatment and of services, must send their children to a national school in such deplorable conditions. There are some great schools, but that is not any consolation. There should not be a variation in standards. It is totally unfair if one area has state-of-the-art facilities, while another area five miles <Col N="89" /> down the road has 19th century facilities. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister cut &euro;70 million from the schools building programme, but he did not indicate the timescale. I know people who have been told that the money is gone and that the job will not be done. I do not have any doubt that more promises will be made in the run-up to the general election in three years' time. People will then be told that the work will be done. People will not accept that.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that people suffer educational disadvantage. Remedial teachers are important and that work must be done. It is deplorable that this is allowed to continue. There is significant unrest. The Minister mentioned the retention of teachers in disadvantaged areas. I do not blame teachers who must work with inadequate facilities and in schools without cloakrooms or IT and staff facilities. Teachers are dedicated to their work. I am often amazed that teachers can work in the schools in which the Minister expects them to work. There is not any standard. I applaud the teachers who work in such conditions every day. Talk is not good enough on this important issue. The Minister must take action and he must indicate when funding will be made available.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Enright for tabling this motion. Many commitments and guarantees were given before the election about how much money was available and how much could be spent. Many schools were told they were on the list and assured that their movement up it was only a matter of time. <i>The Irish Times</i> compiled a list of over 400 schools, which I welcome because there is now some degree of clarity for them in that they know nothing will happen to them. However, others which were expecting works to be carried out were not included. In my own county I see the example of Drumacruttin national school. Remedial teaching and other difficult problems have to be taken care of in the hallway while other children pass by on their way to the toilets. Part of the school is housed in an old prefabricated building, it is built along a dangerous road and the facilities available to it are unreal. Rackwallace national school just down the road does not even have an inside toilet for teachers or pupils who have to go outside on snowy and frosty days, something one would not have expected after the Celtic tiger. As neither school is among the 400 named the question of where they stand must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Connons national school, which is well known to the Ceann Comhairle, has been put on hold. It is part of a project that has received cross-Border funding and an agreement was made that it should start to take advantage of that funding before it was too late. How can the Minister justify putting an idea like that on hold? The parish was one of the first to establish a truly cross-Border project in which its schools worked with the Protestant schools in Aughnacloy to build a relationship that has not been equalled else<Col N="90" /> where. It was accomplished at a time when it was not easy. Grant aid to buy computers was obtained, but it was desired to go further to establish a first class learning facility along the Border. EU funding was received under the peace and reconciliation fund and the site was dug out, but the Department of Education and Science has put the project on hold. I beg the Minister to ensure that a project that is part and parcel of true cross-Border co-operation be permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>Corracrin national school also needs to be developed while the Model School in Monaghan needs dramatic improvement, but is not on the list as one of the 400. Since the last election I must, unfortunately, cover some of the schools in Cavan. Ballyconnell Central School is an old timber prefabricated building consisting of two classrooms and eight of its pupils have to be looked after during special needs classes in the hallway, including one who is in a wheelchair. The other children must pass through that hall on their way to the toilet, as must anyone coming into the school. What sort of environment is that for teachers? Three years ago they were promised a new school, but they have seen no further developments. Cavan No. 1 national school and Ballybay complained last year and were told by a certain Senator that he had a phone and would ring the Department to get the problems they mentioned sorted out, but the election is over and nothing has been done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the recent OECD school rankings report, Ireland still has one of the lowest levels of education spending among almost 30 developed countries. When one considers the amount of wealth we have created over the last ten years, such neglect of our children and young people is a serious indictment of our system. Given that they represent the future, if we are to prioritise any sector of society this should be it. Unfortunately, we are not doing it in terms of education, health or housing. Ireland spent just 4.6% of national income on education in 1999 and though that has improved since, the Minister acknowledged this low level of funding in his reaction to the report in question. The report showed that the average primary school class <Col N="91" /> numbers 25 pupils, while the OECD average is 22. We all visit primary schools and it is obvious that teachers are working in overcrowded conditions.</P>
    <P>The recent INTO survey says it all. Up to 40,000 primary school pupils are not being taught by qualified teachers with schools in disadvantaged areas bearing the brunt of the shortage of trained staff. If any group should be facilitated it is the disadvantaged. When the comprehensive school system was established in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Government encouraged teachers to enter it by providing them with an extra allowance. Teachers should be encouraged to teach in disadvantaged areas in the same way.</P>
    <P>The report examined the overall training of primary teachers, a process which takes three years. If there are still unqualified personnel in charge of classes in primary schools in 2005, INTO members will refuse to work in them. That warning was issued by the general secretary and as sure as day follows night we will have returned to this matter in three years. If the present attitude of the Government prevails there will be a problem.</P>
    <P>There are now 1,600 primary school teaching jobs not filled by primary teachers which is serious. Young children need to be attended to by the most qualified personnel. We are discussing the Arts Bill on Committee Stage tomorrow while there is a major lack of arts education in our system, principally because we do not have the staff. Physical education, an area I am particularly interested in, is almost non-existent in about 70% of our schools. The teachers are not there, the facilities do not exist and there is a lack of confidence. We are producing an unfit race of young people because of our lack of focus on this vulnerable sector of the community. The recent budget means schools will get an average of 50 cent per child per day to cover day-to-day running costs, provision for which is now more in the hands of parents and boards of management than those of the Department of Education and Science. It puts terrible pressure on parents who have to rear their children while collecting funding to run their schools. Insurance and heating costs have spiralled. It is time the Government and the nation prioritised education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Enright on tabling this motion which I hope will have some effect in highlighting the deplorable conditions in primary schools throughout the country. Some of the primary schools are in such a bad state that if a health and safety inspector visited them they would have to be closed down. I hope this debate will lead to some action in the matter but I am not sure it will. The Minister of State is present and listening to the debate. We see him so often on Private Members' time, that he is almost a Minister of State for Private Members. I am sorry the Minister for Education and Science is not present but I hope the message will get <Col N="92" /> back to him because he cannot continue to ignore the problem in our primary schools. He is putting his head in the sand in refusing to meet deputations from parents and boards of management. He will meet his fellow Ministers on various matters but he refuses to meet deputations from school boards and parents.</P>
      <P>The boards of management of probably half the schools in my constituency of West Galway have been in touch with me about various complaints and delays in sanctioning repairs for their schools. I have been contacted by schools such as Bushypark, Coldwood, Maree, St. Nicholas, the Claddagh, Tooreeney, Oughterard and many more.</P>
      <P>A number of schools have leaking roofs, draughty windows, porous doors, broken floors, and broken toilets while some classes are taken in cloakrooms. I visited a school recently where 90 children used the one toilet bowl. Teaching has become such a strenuous occupation that teachers, parents and boards of management have enough to worry about without the fact that they cannot get their schools repaired due to the red tape and six or seven stages involved, at any one of which work can be delayed. Boards of management and parents' committees do not know where they stand at any time. There should be a clear statement indicating that work will not be done for two years, or that it will be done in three years. Some schools ten or 11 years after making application still do not know where they are on the list. The Fine Gael motion asks that this matter be addressed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Enright, for tabling this motion and giving us an opportunity to air this issue in the House. There is no more emotive subject, with the possible exception of health, that draws more reaction from the general public, particularly from parents whose children are attending unfit schools. The sad thing about this is that it comes in the wake of the Celtic tiger which according to all reports has been roving the fields of Ireland for the past five years. The Celtic tiger was supposed to bring benefits to all and sundry but nothing happened in education. When cutbacks were envisaged about a year ago, all that happened in the Department of Education and Science was that the Minister of the day trotted out stories about all the Government had done in the past five years. We have heard much about that during the past six months also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most cynical exercises of all time was that every time a parliamentary question was tabled in the House the response was the same to each question. It brought a cynicism into the House that never existed before. Sadly, this is continuing under the new Administration and the Minister appears to think it is his duty to tell the Opposition to get lost, that it is his job to run the country and the world and that we should go to the Internet if we want answers. There are two ways we can do this. I have warned several times <Col N="93" /> in the House what the consequences of that policy will be and I do not wish to make threats or to issue the warning again. If the Minister persists in that fashion there is a simple way to resolve the problem for him. If he refuses to answer questions in the House about sensitive issues that is tough, but it is his responsibility.</P>
    <P>If a Member tables a question on a specific school and it is embarrassing for the Minister and if he cannot give a positive reply, that is tough. It is tough that he is in that Department and not doing the job he or his predecessor should have done during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go through the various schools in my constituency in respect of which the INTO issued a report a year ago highlighting the places where ordinary health and safety standards do not apply and drawing to the attention of parents and the boards of management in the respective schools the danger to their children. I wonder whether this exercise means anything to the Minister or the Department of Education and Science because when we raise questions about those same schools we are told to go to the Internet.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for a greater number of years than the Minister for Education and Science. In my time here I have never known of anybody being asked to go to the newspapers, the media, or any other source to get information in reply to a parliamentary question. If that is the way the Department and the Minister propose to pursue the education programme there will be an interesting time ahead over the next couple of years in this House.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine for the Minister and the Department to presume to exclude the Opposition from what is being done. There is a system whereby Government backbenchers can be informed in advance about which of the 400 schools will be lucky and while that may go down well at the various Cumann meetings it does not provide for accountability to the House. Whether the Minister likes it or not that is where it all begins and ends. If he does not wish to be responsible to the House that is tough luck. I could list the schools in my constituency in respect of which I have repeatedly tabled parliamentary questions. The Minister in very few cases deigns to answer, but if that continues there will be another way. A famous slogan by a famous party in a famous election not so long ago was &ldquo;There is another way&rdquo;. There is another way, and unless the Minister faces up to his responsibilities in education he will find out what that other way is in a short time.</P>
    <P>This issue is one which occupies the minds of the parents of children attending schools all over the country. It may have been fine to be able to palm off the Opposition and give a glib reply. I am not suggesting the Minister of State, sitting opposite, is guilty of this but it is not such a good idea to give the impression to the parents, children and the teachers involved in education that he is glib with them or to suggest they should go <Col N="94" /> to the Internet to find out what the future holds for them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to convey to his colleague the urgency of the situation and to point out that the situation is serious. Now, immediately after the Celtic tiger period, it is disastrous. I ask the Minister of State to convey that to the Minister as a matter of urgency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the 2,900 additional teaching posts created in primary schools since 1997 at an annual cost of &euro;116 million? These have enabled the introduction of a wide range of improvements. These include: a reduction in the overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule from 35 in the 1995-96 school year to 29 in the 2002-03 school year; the lowering of the figure to 12 pupils for the appointment and retention of the first mainstream class teacher; the reduction in enrolment <Col N="96" /> figures required for the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools and Gaelscoileanna; the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools where there are nine or more teachers, including ex-quota posts; the allocation of resource teaching posts to either individual schools or clusters of schools where needs are identified; the allocation of teaching posts to schools where 13 or more pupils with significant English language deficits are identified and the allocation of additional learning support teaching posts and the establishment of the programme Giving Children an Even Break.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a particular focus on reducing class size in schools in disadvantaged areas. The 30 schools in the Breaking the Cycle programme operate to a maximum class size of 15:1 for junior classes and 27:1 for senior classes.</P>
    <P>The Giving Children an Even Break programme was launched in January 2001 and it subsumed the previous process of designation of schools that served areas of educational disadvantage. A maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 27:1 in senior classes applies in all schools in the programme.</P>
    <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to reduce the pupil teacher ratio in our schools, to progressively introduce maximum class size guidelines which will ensure that the average size of classes for children in junior classes will be below international best practice guidelines of 20:1&mdash;</P>

The Government's commitment to the special needs area is reflected across the spectrum of provision. The number of special resource teachers supporting children with special needs in ordinary primary schools will have grown from approximately 100 at the end of 1998 to more than 2,200 by the end of this year. The number of special needs assistants in the primary system will have grown from approximately 300 to 3,800 full-time and a further 1,000 part-time assistants over the same period.</P>

      <P>Despite the huge increase in the level of funding for primary school buildings and renovation over the past several years, there has been a corresponding level of demand due to an historical deficit in investment in this area. All of the problems relating to school accommodation cannot be addressed overnight. However, the Government is committed to continuing the work that it has started on the renewal of infrastructure in the primary sector and to consolidating the substantial progress already made in meeting the needs of primary schools over time. The investment in educational infrastructure begun during the previous administration will be continued and the allocation of &euro;147 million will enable consolidation of the considerable progress that has already been made.</P>
      <P>This Government can be justifiably proud of the massive expansion of teaching and other resources it has allocated in recent years to support the education of children in primary schools, particularly those with special educational needs and those who are most disadvantaged. It will continue, through the school building programme, to meet the new and emerging needs and to eliminate the substandard accommodation which has accumulated in primary schools because of past under-investment.</P>

      <P>I would be happy to engage in a debate with the Deputy if time permitted. However, it is wrong that I should be obstructed when I am under pressure of time. I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate. I welcome the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. I also compliment the Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Enright, on her work in this regard. Although we may have to agree to disagree on some issues, I wish her well.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to raise any hackles, one would get the impression from listening to some of the Members opposite that the Minister for Education and Science and his Department officials are doing nothing to improve the welfare of primary school children. That is just not true. There are problems with regard to the condition of many of our schools and we wish to have matters put right immediately. However, the reality is that the money is just not there. As a Deputy for Dublin South West, including Tallaght, I have raised a number of important issues concerning my constituency since my election some months ago, including the condition of schools at Glenasmole, St. Killians at Castleview, Bishop Shanahan and Bishop Galvin schools at Orwell and many other issues. In that regard, I will continue to do my job. That is what people want me to do without fear or favour and that is the reason they voted for me and other colleagues last May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to the impression from the Opposition side that nothing is being done, the reality <Col N="99" /> is quite different. Next year, the Minister for Education and Science will spend &euro;147 million on capital investment in the primary schools sector, in addition to nearly &euro;173 million spent this year when more than 120 primary school capital projects were completed and 1,700 grants for national schools were sanctioned at a cost of &euro;61 million. My only comment to the Minister in that regard is &ldquo;well done&rdquo; and, to quote the sound-bite &ldquo;a lot done, more to do&rdquo;. The Minister and his officials have my full support.</P>
    <P>Some schools in my constituency are in the disadvantaged schools category. I congratulate the Minister on increasing the number of resource teachers on a national basis to 2,200 from a low base of 100 in 1998. In the same period, the number of special needs assistants has increased to 3,800 full time and 1,000 part time, from a base of 300. More than 225 additional learning support teachers have also been provided during that period. Expenditure on special equipment for children with special needs has increased from &euro;650,000 to &euro;3.3 million. More than &euro;43 million is spent on the special school transport service. One could quote many more facts. I have listed but a few of the actions taken by the Minister for Education and Science and his Department. This House should applaud the Minister and his officials for their achievements to date and support them in moving to meet the needs of our constituencies over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Each of us has a responsibility to our constituents and our communities to raise those issues. My position on the Government side of the House does not prevent me from questioning the Minister in the House and pursuing issues raised with me at public meetings, at my clinics or as I meet people in the Square in Tallaght on a daily basis. I am happy to have contributed briefly to this debate and I look forward to its continuation tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an leasú a mhol an tAire Stáit. Chaith me breis agus 20 bliain mar mhúinteoir bunscoile, an chéad bhliain mar chúntóir agus an chuid eile den ama mar phríomhoide, i scoil bheag tuaithe. Ar feadh breis agus leath den ama sin lasadh mé tine ins an dá sheomra nuair a thágadh mé ar scoil gach maidin, le cabhair ó chuid de na daltaí móra. Ní fhaca mé ariamh múinteoir feabhais nó cúntóir speisialta. Fiú nuair a bhí triúir mhúinteoir agus beagnach 100 dalta sa scoil ní raibh a leithéid le fáil againn. Ceapadh mé mar phríomhoide i ndá scoil, agus an chéad rud a bhí le déanamh agam an dá uair ná córas uisce a fháil agus leithris a chur isteach ins na scoileanna. Bliain amháin bhí 43 pháiste á múineadh le chéile agam i gcúig rang. Ní 100 bliain ó shin a tharla na rudaí seo ach i dtús na n-ochtóidí.</P>

Insím é freisin chun an t-easpa infheistíocht a bhí san oideachas bunscoile leis na cianta a léiriú.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfadh éinne milleán a chur ar mhúinteoirí nó ar thuismitheoirí as ucht a bheith ag gearáin faoi na fadhbanna sa chóras bhunoideachais ach tá sé deacair aird a thabhairt ar pholaiteoirí agus ar pháirtí polaitíochta a bhí ina mbaill den Rialtas cúig nó sé bliain ó shin nuair a bhí an scéal céanna á léiriú acu. Bhí seans ag gach páirtí dul chun cinn a dhéanamh agus cur leis an córas. Níor chuir aon pháirtí an infheistíocht cheart isteach sa chóras bhunoideachais.</P>
    <P>Tremendous progress has been made in primary education in recent years, particularly over the past five years. I am conscious that nearly all of that progress has taken place since I finished my career as a teacher. In 1992, when I last taught, there were virtually no remedial teachers. There were certainly none outside of very big schools. There were no special needs classroom assistants and resource teachers were unheard of. That situation pre-dated the era of inclusiveness in integrating special needs children into ordinary primary schools. In most rural areas, the <i>de facto </i>situation was that all children from a school catchment population attended that school because they did not generally have access to special schools. For many rural schools, there has been no substantial change in the situation. Also, there was no part time tuition available to students who needed such support. The schools psychological service had just begun but had not yet developed to any significant extent. While it is not mentioned specifically in the motion or the amendment before the House, it is one of the areas that will continue to need extra resources and attention.</P>
    <P>A very worrying belief has been mentioned by a number of speakers. A higher percentage of Irish children are presenting with special needs than is the case in other countries. We do not have definite figures but, if it is true, it is a worrying trend. There is a substantially increased demand for services due to the incidence of autism, ADD, Asperger's syndrome and other conditions and there is a major question regarding the numbers presenting but this is a question for health and medical professionals. It is an area we must examine closely to establish if we have a particular problem and what the causes are.</P>
    <P>Anyone would be impressed that 2,900 extra teaching posts have been created in primary education since 1997 and that the ratio is now 19:1 as opposed to 21.7:1. Primary education is undoubtedly the most important aspect of education and the teacher-pupil ratio is one of the important factors in achieving the best results at that level and throughout the education system. There is need to take account of the needs of special needs children and that has been happening gradually which has created difficulties for the building programme. The schools I described, which did not have even basic services like water and flush <Col N="101" /> toilets in the 1970s and into the 1980s, were certainly not in a position to accommodate special classes or remedial and resource teachers in terms of classroom size. There were difficulties in relation to special needs assistants. The building programme has many defects due to the fact there was poor investment in infrastructure and primary education generally until recently. The effects of that past under-investment continue to dog individual schools listed by a number of Deputies. I could list some too if I was put to it.</P>
    <P>One of the areas expected to address the difficulties is the public private partnership area. I would like to see a thorough cost-benefit analysis of that versus the traditional tender-contract system. We also urgently need to examine the cost-effectiveness of providing pre-fabricated buildings. In relation to the building programme, the Minister is correct to take stock and ensure that expenditure on consultants' fees for projects which are several years away from being started is strictly monitored. It would be a great advantage if a grants scheme was available to schools to provide, for instance, a remedial room, resource teacher or relatively minor additional accommodation which, equally, could be provided at modest cost.</P>
    <P>Unlike virtually every other speaker, I welcome the Minister's move to publish the list of schools and make the area of school building more transparent. There is no advantage to Government Deputies in pretending they influence the rate at which schools are built. This is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this important debate on a subject of relevance to every parish in the country. We could not get a better analysis &ndash; in this House or elsewhere &ndash; of primary school education than we got from Deputy Killeen &ndash; trí Ghaeilge agus trí Bhéarla &ndash; when he outlined the great improvements that have occurred in the last few years, particularly at primary level, and indeed at secondary and third level in education. I am sure, as the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, outlined earlier, the Minister for Education and Science will have an opportunity to deal in detail with the motion put forward by Deputy Enright and her colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note from the motion that there are specific references to class sizes, recruitment of teachers for mainstream, special needs and resource classes, the general area of disadvantage, the need to continue with the schools building programme and the concern about inadequate classroom accommodation. Those of us who have taken an interest in education over the years have to acknowledge that substantial progress has been made in all of those areas over the past five years. This contention is borne out when we note that 2,900 additional primary teaching posts have been created since 1997. One of the most important decisions taken in the education area was in 1998 which provided specifically for children with special needs, regardless of their level <Col N="102" /> of need or location. Prior to that, all of us, as public representatives, would have had constant representations in relation to the needs of some children in most primary schools. The decision by then Minister for Education, Deputy Martin, to make appointments at that time has helped thousands of pupils. Prior to that, the number of appointments in the area of special needs was totally inadequate. Progress in the area was long overdue but the concentrated investment since 1997 has improved the situation immensely. That commitment to tackle disadvantage and provide for children is evident when we consider that, at the end of this year, the number of special resource teachers will have increased to 2,200 from approximately 100 in 1998. The number of special needs assistants at primary level will have grown from approximately 300 to 3,800 full time and a further 1,000 part time over the same period of time. Those are welcome appointments which are making a real difference in primary schools throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In recent times, there has understandably been much comment about inadequate school buildings and over-crowded classrooms. We need a large-scale schools building programme to bring all accommodation up to the standards that pupils and staff deserve. There are too many schools that lack basic facilities and whose standards are inadequate. It may sound strange to say, but in one respect, I am glad we have over-crowding problems in some schools, particularly in rural Ireland. In most respects, these problems have arisen because of the welcome increase in our population resulting in an increase in the school-going population. Many schools in our smaller towns and villages and rural communities have experienced a considerable increase in their enrolment figures. This trend has put pressure on existing facilities. Similarly, the appointment of thousands of additional teachers in mainstream classes, teaching support for pupils with special needs and resource teachers have all combined to put pressure on existing accommodation. Quite rightly, the teaching appointments were sanctioned because if we were to wait for the extra accommodation to be put in place first, thousands of pupils would have been denied the additional teaching support they needed and are now availing of and which can be improved upon even more. For too long, public representatives had to deal with the problems of declining enrolments, loss of teachers and loss of hope in many rural parishes.</P>
    <P>I compliment officials in the building unit of the Department of Education and Science on the administrative and technical side. They have a difficult task. Their work is mainly to provide, at the earliest possible opportunity, quality accommodation in our schools. Their task is never easy &ndash; trying to balance fairly the demands and needs of increasing pupil numbers in new housing areas and shifting population trends, leaving excess accommodation in some areas and shortages elsewhere as well as the continuing problem of finite resources. A major primary schools building pro<Col N="103" /> gramme has been undertaken in the last few years and there are now new and extended schools of an excellent standard provided in every county since 1997. I hope the establishment of the national development finance agency will enable more funding to be provided for capital investment in school facilities at primary, secondary, further and third level education.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Killeen said, we are not getting good value for money. An 11% professional fee should not be chargeable on every school building. There are people of outstanding competence and ability on the administrative side of the Department and I would like to see those officials aided by more support and personnel being given an opportunity to do more of the planning and design work. If four-teacher schools are to be provided in Cork, Offaly, Galway, Cavan, Carlow, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford, why should an architectural design team be appointed in each county to design each school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Enright on the comprehensive motion she has moved, which addresses the real problems facing the primary school system. In demonstrating the current realities in the primary sector, the Fine Gael motion is in stark contrast to many of the points in An Agreed Programme for Government. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme addresses many issues about which we all feel strongly, but the reality is very different. For example, the programme states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will continue to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools. Over the next five years we will progressively introduce maximum class guidelines, which would ensure that the average size of classes for children under nine will be below the international best practice guidelines of 20:1. We will ensure that reducing <Col N="104" /> absenteeism in early school leaving is a core priority over the next five years. The national education welfare board will begin its work this year. We will ensure that every school building attains set modern standards.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the aspirations in the programme for Government but the primary school building programme has been halted and there is a freeze on public sector employment. I will return to this point later and I hope the Minister for Education and Science will address my questions in this regard.</P>
    <P>The education welfare officers have not been appointed so, in effect, there is a vacuum in that area because the previous legislation no longer applies now that the new Act is in force. In last week's budget, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance did not go up for under 12s &ndash; it stayed at the current rate. The OECD has indicated that Ireland has among the largest class sizes in the developed world. The reality, therefore, is very different from the picture that was portrayed in the Programme for Government before the election. People were deceived into thinking we would witness progress in education but that has not happened. In fact, we are going backwards, which is appalling, particularly in the primary sector.</P>
    <P>Education has the potential to change people's lives. Disadvantage that may date back generations can be tackled if pupils get a chance in the early stages of the educational process. That has been proven many times by research, yet the Estimates are demonstrating a real halt in progress at a time when the country is still relatively rich. There may be a blip in the national income, but we are at a considerably advanced stage of development and so our educational facilities should move forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to Breaking the Cycle as one of the achievements of the current Administration, but it is not. That programme was introduced by the former Minister for Education, Ms Niamh Bhreathnach, before Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats took over. It has hardly been expanded upon at all. Similarly the Early Start programme, which began under the Government of which Ms Niamh Bhreathnach was a member, has hardly been expanded either. It is clear that if children get a break at a very early age, and if resources are provided to ensure an even playing field at primary level both for disadvantaged children and those from more privileged backgrounds, that will make a difference. Neither of those programmes, however, has been significantly developed by the current Government.</P>
    <P>I will address some of the issues in the motion, including the school building programme which has already been mentioned widely in the debate. Descriptions have been provided of schools that are in dreadful conditions. Although Deputy Killeen delved into the past and we could all do that, given the level of national income we now enjoy, <Col N="105" /> it is appalling that schools have been left in such conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to the age of one of the buildings housing Gaelscoil Sairséal in my constituency, and the fact that it is on two campuses. The pupils have only a pocket-sized area in which to move around outdoors. The second building is a band room that was given to the school by one of the local marching bands because they were so stuck for space.</P>
    <P>Another school just outside my constituency, in Adare, County Limerick, is housed in a building that is 600 years old, so that beats the previous example. The conditions are appalling and clarity is required from the Minister as to what is happening with the school building programme. Hundreds of school managements are waiting and wondering what is going on with the famous architectural planning stage. There is also a problem with school building projects that are at tender stage; schools may have received permission to accept tenders but they need to reach the final stage and time is running out to accept the tender they intend to take. Problems exist at all levels of the school building programme and it is a regressive step to have cut the amount of money available for it, particularly at primary level.</P>
    <P>Many Members have spoken about children with special needs and I agree that the Government has made progress in that regard. I do not wish to be churlish by failing to give credit where it is due, but there is real concern following the announcement in the budget that public sector jobs are to be frozen. We raised that matter in committee last week with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, who said he did not expect the jobs freeze to affect these areas. That attitude is not good enough, however, for schools that require special needs teachers, not to mention ordinary teachers, educational psychologists, and speech and language therapists. Immediate clarification is required on that point. We need to know that this freeze on public sector jobs will not affect children with special needs &ndash; including ADD, autism and Asperger's syndrome &ndash; who are among the most disadvantaged in our school system. They cannot benefit from a system that is designed for the average student.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton asked how such students are being diagnosed and whether the problem is as serious as it appears to be. That matter needs to be addressed but children who have already been diagnosed with special needs require specialised teachers. It is essential, therefore, that we get an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>I would also have expected to see progress being made in the coming year in catering for children with learning disabilities. I am thinking in particular about children who would be covered by the education for children with disabilities Bill that was supposed to be published in this session. That legislation will not be published until next year, however, and we do not know when it will become law. No money appears to <Col N="106" /> have been set aside next year to provide resources for the Bill's provisions. If children are given rights under the terms of a Bill, the wherewithal should be provided to fulfil those rights and give them the support they need at school. That legislation has been promised should focus minds at the Department of Finance and the Department of Education and Science so that the necessary funding will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Disabilities Bill was withdrawn last year but when it was first mooted that people with disabilities should be given rights to education, health and social services, the Department of Finance objected to the proposal &ndash; which came from the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities &ndash; saying it would be too costly.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Department of Finance will put a spanner in the works again so we need to ensure that the Department of Education and Science insists that there is money to implement the provisions of the legislation. I tabled a number of Dáil questions on the area of education welfare, including my first oral question as education spokesperson, and I have had correspondence and phone calls. It seems clear that there will not be any education welfare officers in place by the end of the year despite financial provision being made.</P>
    <P>I have had correspondence from someone working in the Children's Court who says that cases are being thrown out or put on hold because the 1926 Act no longer applies. It has been superseded by the Education Welfare Act. Therefore children who do not attend school regularly cannot be dealt with under the provisions of the old Act and are effectively in a vacuum. In a case which was reported recently the courts could do nothing about a child's need for education because education welfare officers had not been appointed. It is the responsibility of truancy officers in certain parts of the country, in other parts it is the Garda. These are children who are the most educationally disadvantaged because they are not attending school at all. There is a real urgency about this and I hope that the Minister will attend to it. So far the answers I have been getting to my questions are to the effect that this is now the responsibility of the education welfare board. That is not good enough. The children are left with nobody to protect them while the education welfare board is being set up. I know there have been difficulties with it but it should be an urgent requirement and funding should be provided for the education welfare officers to be appointed.</P>
    <P>I want to address the issue of school meals. My colleague, Deputy Burton, spoke about this in her Budget speech. There has been a small sum of money, &euro;2 million, allocated for the school meals programme. To extend it and provide for it properly five times that amount would be needed. I urge that this be addressed because it is a real way of meeting the needs of the most deprived children. A school meal can be something to look forward to, it can mean having the strength to sit <Col N="107" /> through the school day. It is one of those programmes which, with our relative wealth, we should address. Other European countries seem able to provide these things.</P>
    <P>There have been real cutbacks in education. Deputy Enright referred to cutbacks in the school retention programme and the access programmes to second level, one a &euro;6 million cut and the other &euro;5 million. The schools building programme has been frozen and there are other issues outlined in the House. The Minister keeps flying a kite about third level fees. I am worried that this issue is being used to deflect attention from the real cuts which are taking place in the education service. He keeps adding a lovely, colourful tail to the kite. Yesterday he talked about a loan scheme. He comes out every week with a way to bring in third level fees one way or the other. It makes people think that he is really concerned about disadvantage and will somehow bring money into the third level budget through the third level system. This is fundamentally dishonest. When the Minister talks about disadvantage what he is actually doing is not addressing the problem. The lovely kite up in the air which gets more colourful by the minute is distracting attention from the real issues that the Minster should be addressing if he is concerned about disadvantage in the education system.</P>

      <P>I want to focus on areas of special need and disadvantage. There are problems in all of our constituencies with the shortage of speech and language therapists. Hopefully 75 additional places will be provided at the start of the new academic year in September 2003 to train speech and language therapists. Unfortunately the dividend for this will not arise until the end of the 2007/8 academic year, over four years away. The only speech and language places available in Ireland are in Finnerty where there are 29 places, 27 of which are filled. I understand that 25 of the 27 are first-time students. There was a proposal to have speech and language therapy assistants put in place. This is very attractive in view of the serious shortfall which exists. I know of one instance where the Department of Education and Science set up a special speech and language therapy class and no speech and language therapist was available. I understand a small amount of time is now available to students but it is nonsense to have such a class set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speech is one aspect of the problem but language is the other side of it. There are children who do not understand language. Unless they are given the training to bring their language skills up to a level where they can progress at a normal rate in school, the difficulty will continue. My contention has long been that the speech and lan<Col N="108" /> guage therapy grade should have been put in place and the speech and language therapy assistants could work then to a senior speech and language therapist in order that children will not have to wait until 2008. Some of them will have gone out of the system before they get professional attention. The responsibility for places in speech and language therapy is with the Department of Education and Science. It is to its shame that so little has been achieved, particularly in recent years when there was a great deal of money to provide new places and training.</P>
    <P>The other area I will deal with is that of dysfunctional children who cannot cope in the primary system. They are unable to accept ordinary discipline. They need to undergo educational psychological assessment. That situation is improving somewhat. During the course of the passage of the Education Act, I sought that there would be at least one education officer in each VEC area. It is important, and this is not in the legislation, that this person should have the statutory power to co-ordinate the various services and deal with the child's problem in a family context. There are many resources and people who deal with the problems of dysfunctional children but the buck does not stop anywhere in particular. If progress is to be made there must be an identifiable person with whom the responsibility resides at the end of the day so that the child is assessed and a programme put in place for him. The parents should be involved in the plan but it should be monitored and if progress is not made then responsibility would rest with a particular person. As it stands, where responsibility is shared between various agencies and there is no central person to pull all the elements together, only marginal progress is made in many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start where the Minister left off and quote the last line of her speech. It states: &ldquo;It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need.&rdquo;  Today CORI stated that the budget was unfair, unjust and unacceptable and that the Government has insulted Ireland's poorest people again. CORI is a Christian organisation. How could the Minister allow this to happen? I knew there were bad days ahead when I saw the former Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, leaving the Department <Col N="109" /> because he liked to believe that he was a Minister for good news.</P>
      <P>This budget has attacked the people on social welfare and, with inflation running at almost 6%, an increase of &euro;6 has been wiped out overnight. We used to have a budget every year. Since this Government came into office we have had a budget not every week but every hour on the hour. No later than Tuesday night we heard the Minister for Health and Children on the drug subsidy scheme; on Wednesday we had the Minister for Social and Family Affairs; on Thursday we had the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen; and today, through the media, our own Minister attacked the most vulnerable in society again by attacking the back to work scheme. In the past a person who had been unemployed for 15 months could avail of the back to work scheme. Now a person must be unemployed for five years before he or she can avail of that scheme. That is outrageous. It is an attack on the poor and the weak, on people that want to get back to work. The Minister should change her mind immediately because this scheme encourages people to get back into the workplace.</P>
      <P>The budget was outrageous. Before the Government Deputies are flown in tomorrow with their scripts prepared by the programme managers, I will demonstrate how I could straight away allocate &euro;21 million to the Department and then go on with my speech. The Minister, following the tradition of the last Minister &ndash; she is more photogenic than the last Minister &ndash; spent &euro;310,000 on advertising the personal public service number. I wondered why Independent Newspapers and RTE were doing favourable articles about her. They were getting big money out of social welfare while people on the breadline were not able to live in this country. That is outrageous. The other money I could save relates to my favourite area. I want the officials to take note of this and bring it to the attention of the Department. I want CORI, the St. Vincent de Paul, and all the people of this country to know what is going on here. In the past two years the Department of Social and Family Affairs spent &euro;19,620,242.45 on reports and consultants' fees. Consultancy is the fastest growing industry here and one would think the consultants were the people who were in need of and short of money. I have saved &euro;21 million for the Department in two minutes, and I am not the Minister. If that money was spent on the people who need it most, I would be happy.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister, to spokespeople and to spin doctors. They talked about increases of &euro;6 and &euro;10. With inflation running at almost 6% last week's increase has already been wiped out. The 1% VAT increase means the price of food and electricity will go up. The cost <Col N="110" /> of a television licence is being increased and, in the new year when the county councils calculate their rents again, the few euro that people got will be taken from them.</P>

      <P>The spin doctors talked about all that has been done for people on social welfare. I acknowledge that over the past few years there were fairly generous increases. The Government promised a three-year programme regarding child benefit. The best year of the programme was this year &ndash; last May, a couple of days before the general election, people on social welfare got all their back money and all their payments.</P>

      <P>That is what gives politics and politicians a bad name. That is why people do not want to vote. That is why they are sick and tired of politics. It was a three-year programme. The Minister was writing a book last year, a best seller. We had the &ldquo;green&rdquo; choir at the back clapping about all the increases. This week the green choir was not to be heard. It was the silent green choir. There was no clapping because they have caught it on the ground since they went home last week and people are quite upset. If the Government wanted to do the decent, honest thing, it would have frozen the price of all foodstuffs since 1 January last year to give everybody an opportunity to adjust. Since the euro was introduced prices have been going up every day. If one goes into a supermarket to buy a packet of nappies, and the Minister would know all about that&mdash;</P>

If there were five weeks in the month it would <Col N="111" /> amount to &euro;1.75. It is not right. It is no wonder CORI was appalled.

      <P>Like all rich people they did not start the cuts with Alex Ferguson and his horse, Rock of Gibraltar. He can bring his stallions into this country and get millions of pounds and walk away tax free. Where did the three wise men start? They started with the poor and the weak. Now they want to look at child benefit, if not to get rid of it altogether, to tax it. The Minister is a woman, and a woman of whom I am very fond. She should not allow this to happen. That is money women get into their hands and statistics show that it is spent on their children. Some men are very rich but they are very mean and some of the women of this country never handle a pound from them. However, they get child benefit into their hands and I am opposed to taxing it or getting rid of it. I say to the Minister now, do not do it. If she does, it will be the end of Fianna Fáil and the end of her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that before. I want the Minister to look at another anomaly. Twins receive 150% of the normal monthly rate of child benefit, but other multiple births receive 200% of the normal monthly rate. The Irish Multiple Births Association has sought changes in this area for many years and I am asking the Minister to look at its request in the context of the Social Welfare Bill, 2002. Parents of twins encounter great costs and the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, should make all multiple births equal. It is hard enough for a woman with one child, but she needs even greater support if she has two or three. I am asking that the matter be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disgraceful aspect of this year's budget was that child dependent allowance was not increased. The groups that made submissions to the Department were looking for an increase of at least &euro;25, but there was no increase for the children of this State. I am very upset about this <Col N="112" /> matter. The Minister has spoken about introducing a second Bill, but I want a supplementary budget to try to increase child allowances in line with inflation. The <i>status quo</i> is not fair or right.</P>
    <P>While I compliment the Government for looking after widows and widowers over the age of 66 in the budget, I am concerned about those under that age. Since the foundation of the State, such people have represented the most forgotten sector of Irish society. It is bad enough to lose one's partner and to find that one's income has been massively reduced without discovering that the State will do little to help. It is wrong that such people should receive unfair treatment and more should be done to help them. I call on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to bring those under 66 into line with those over that age as soon as possible. I am concerned about the free schemes in the case of a widow under 60 years of age whose partner is older. If her partner dies, she will lose her free scheme entitlements. I know that an adjustment was made in relation to this matter last year, but I propose that people in such circumstances be allowed to retain their benefits for a year. It is hard enough to lose one's partner without losing out financially as well.</P>
    <P>I intend to discuss carer's allowance on all stages of this Bill, as carers have been let down by the Government. There are more than 100,000 carers in Ireland, but only about 23,000 of them receive payments from the State. The 75,000 carers approximately who do not receive any assistance are the forgotten people of this country. They provide a wonderful service and I call on the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to do something to help them. The time has come to recognise the work of those who, because of their means, are not assisted by the State.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board did damage to those who help old people in their homes when it ran out of money last year. The Ministers opposite may be able to stand over that, but I would not be able to sleep at night if I were a member of a Government that was involved in such a measure. I would bring in the chief executive of the health board and tell him that I intended to resign if he did not resign, but I would ensure that he did so. I do not blame the Minister for Finance for writing to the Minister for Health and Children, as somebody has to do something about what is happening in the health service. If one examines the Official Report from the time when I was Fine Gael's health spokesman, one will see that I said that I would sack the officials in the health service and start again.</P>

      <P>This is a serious business. The provisions of the national fuel scheme are so inadequate that one would think we were living in Spain. Those who are in charge of it seem to think we get nine months of sunshine, as it has not been extended or increased. The two things that old or vulnerable people want in their homes are safety and warmth, but many of them will be unable to buy a bag of coal tonight as a result of the Government's loss of control over what is going on in this country. The fact that the fuel allowance has not been increased in this Bill represents an attack on the elderly and is an indictment of the Ministers. They have allowed this to happen when they could have used some of the &euro;21 million I showed them how to save some moments ago.</P>
      <P>Newspapers, including <i>The News of the World,</i> praised the Christmas bonus provisions made by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I can appreciate why she was given such a write-up, considering her Department's media expenditure. It spent about &euro;300,000 as follows: &euro;120,000 on television advertising, &euro;44,000 on radio advertising and &euro;132,000 on advertising the PPSN in newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is especially wrong given that the fund is in the black. The previous Minister in this Department took &euro;650 million from the fund, so why can the current Minister not take &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million to deal with the short-term unemployed, carers and others? We should be helping such people instead of assisting Alex Ferguson and people like him.</P>
      <P>I would also like some answers about UK pensions, particularly about how interest is collated at the beginning of the year. Where can I get the 10% that is being taken from English pensions? I know the SSIA scheme will give me &euro;1 for every &euro;4 I invest, but 10% is not a bad return for those who have more money to invest. Thousands of people would like to know how they can get involved. People who left this country in the 1930s and 1940s sent money home to their mothers and fathers in Ireland from the United States and England. Many of them who have returned home with a portion of a pension are penalised when they do so. It is not right and we should do something about it. Special attention should be given to the way in which interest is calculated on the moneys. I am asking the Government to re-examine this matter, as it is not right.</P>
      <P>Rent subsidies are also being attacked, to the detriment of the most vulnerable in society. Why is the Government afraid to take on the vested interests in the property sector rather than the weak? Family income supplement is another source of concern. The former Minister in this Department, Deputy Dermot Ahern, calculated last year that an additional 2,500 people would qualify for the supplement as a result of changes he made in last year's Social Welfare Bill. The Department made great savings when it transpired that only 400 people qualified.</P>

It is a shame that I have to finish as I would like to quote from the Conference of Religious of Ireland.

      <P>That is the way he went out. He was blazoned all over the television and the newspapers, talking on radio, telling people to contact their friendly Minister because he was the one who would deliver for them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an example. Let us take the example, during the term of the last Government from 1998 to last year, of a young, single person with no commitments earning &euro;60,000 &ndash; which is not a bad salary, we were not earning that at the time. What did the Government give back to such a person in tax breaks over that period? His or her tax bill was reduced by &euro;6,000. How much did the former Minister, Deputy Ahern, give to a single person on unemployment benefit over the same period? He gave him or her &euro;33 per week. The person on &euro;60,000 got &euro;120 per week into his or her pocket, while the person on social welfare got &euro;33. How can the Minister justify that? How can she say that is reasonable and just? She cannot do so as it is impossible to justify.</P>
      <P>CORI's justice commission issued a press release today regarding the budget. The headline states: &ldquo;unfair, unjust, unacceptable! Government insults Ireland's poorest people again.&rdquo;  Is it not outrageous that any Government should have a headline like that written about it? It was not written by a right-wing organisation or a crowd of pinkos, but a Christian organisation working with poorer people and trying to improve their lot. The analysis goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Budget 2003 marks a moment of truth for this Government. It has dramatically failed to address the substantial poverty and social exclusion which still persists in Ireland today. It has widened the gap between the rich and the poor, a gap which is the worst in the EU.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister, when she responds, will try to address some of those issues. I hope she will take a serious look at the criticism that has been heaped upon her and that she will come back and say something worthwhile. The CORI report goes on to state: &ldquo;An unemployed couple with one child will be 25 cents a week better off in real terms than they were in 2002.&rdquo;  Twenty five cent a week. If the Minister saw somebody on the street holding out a plastic cup she would give him or her more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not dreadful to give a couple on social welfare with one child 25 cent a week? Then we can go down through all the <Col N="117" /> other things mentioned. As my colleague, Deputy Ring, said, every day when we open the newspapers there is some other cutback or announcement. The Minister has done her fair share of it. She capped the rent allowance and I know why &ndash; because it went to &euro;300 million per year. This has occurred because the Government has allowed the rental market to go mad. If that &euro;300 million was ploughed into local authority houses and affordable housing schemes the problem would be eased and the need for intervention in rent allowance would be reduced. The Minister did not do that, however. All she did was put a cap on the allowance and make those people more miserable than they already were. That is not fair.</P>
      <P>Deputies Ring and Penrose told me earlier today that the Minister has now put a cap on the back to work allowance. I do not know how she can justify that. On Committee Stage of this Bill, Deputies Ring, Penrose and I will table amendments to increase the child dependant allowance. The Minister will have a brief prepared by her officials and I can tell her what it will say because I have done this before and I am used to their briefs. Of course, they are used to what I say too. They can probably prepare it in advance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>They will say that we must not increase the child dependant allowance because it is a disincentive to work. However, one of the incentives to work is the back to work allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Many a person has gone back to work because that tipped the balance and when they actually get out working they enjoy it and they like the few pounds in their pocket. This is a major incentive to go back to work which the Minister has taken away. It is not fair.</P>
      <P>The child dependant allowance has remained stable for a number of years. We have three different rates of allowance. If the father is unemployed one rate of child dependent allowance obtains; if the father is a widower the rate is different and if he is on an invalidity pension the rate is different again. How can that be justified? Three children sitting beside each other in school can be getting three different rates of child dependant allowance. It cannot be justified. Why will the Minister not do anything about it? It is because she knows that the only way of solving the problem is to go to the higher rate and she has not got the money. The Minister for Finance will not give her the money so the unjust situation continues. She is prepared to treat people differently, not to give everyone a fair crack of the whip, rather than to fight for the extra money needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" />The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made his name on individualisation of taxation. Did he go down the road of individualisation for the social welfare system? No. It only suits the Government in the taxation system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. P. McGrath Mr. P. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Individualisation in social welfare would cost them a few pounds more so they will not do anything about it.</P>
      <P>There is a whole range of anomalies that could be mentioned. I will describe something to the Minister which I also told her predecessor and I hope she is concerned enough to do something about it. Two gentlemen live next door to each other in Mullingar. Deputy Penrose probably knows them too. They both came home from England and one of them went to work. He will be retiring in a couple of years. He will have worked in Ireland for about 15 years and paid full stamps for the whole period. He will draw a pension at 66.</P>
      <P>His next door neighbour came home and worked for a short time. He did a FÁS scheme, became unemployed and then retired. He applied for his pension and got the full rate of contributory old-age pension because he had accumulated enough contributions in the ten-year period since he had come home from England on FÁS schemes and so on &ndash; fair play to him. The first man, who will be retiring next year, has worked for 13 years in this country, never drew the dole or entered a FÁS scheme and paid all his taxes. According to our projection he will not get a pension. This is because when he was 15 he was employed &ndash; illegally &ndash; by Leitrim County Council. Deputy Penrose is shaking his head &ndash; he knows the man I am talking about. He clocked up a year's employment with Leitrim County Council when he was 15. When the Department of Social and Family Affairs looked at his contributions, it said that he had 52 from when he was 15 and, taking into account the more recent contributions, concluded that he was in the workforce in Ireland for 50 years. His total number of Irish stamps was divided by 50 and he qualified for half a pension. Is it fair that a man who has contributed so much should be treated in that manner?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget introduced by the Minister for Finance last week has been roundly and justifiably condemned by many people and organisations for its inequitable and unjust provisions, particularly the effects it will have on the poorest in our society, the unemployed, the underprivileged, the socially excluded and all of those who are in most need of and deserving of our social support. When the Minister for Finance was in Opposition in 1997, in criticising the budget of the rainbow coalition Government, he <Col N="119" /> stated that when cutbacks in Government spending are necessary, &ldquo;it is always the poor at the bottom of the scale who suffer most&rdquo;. In this budget he has amply demonstrated his belief in and commitment to that principle.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in introducing the social welfare provisions of the budget, has spelt out in detail the extent of the injustice being inflicted by this Government on weaker sections of society. As I listened to the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement, I felt some sympathy for his colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, in her first year at the Cabinet table, for the miserable hand the Minister for Finance had dealt her to cope with the demands of her Department. An increase of &euro;530 million, compared with more than &euro;1 billion in each of the previous two years when Deputy Dermot Ahern was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, makes it impossible to make progress in advancing services for the poor and disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>My sympathy did not last long. She has to ensure that people who are utterly dependent on her Department's payments are properly looked after and it is up to her to fight her case in Cabinet. She must roll away the right wing ideology of the Progressive Democrats. They are all for the business class, they have no interest in the working class and even less for the underprivileged or those dependent on the State. I know them and their type and that is how they feel.</P>
      <P>The Minister is participating in an orchestrated campaign by members of the coalition parties to claim that the Government, in this budget, is treating social welfare recipients fairly. One of them had the neck to say it is a socialist budget. If that is a socialist budget I do not know what I am because I am a socialist and I believe in increasing taxes to pay for the poor. The Progressive Democrats want the rich to get richer and to widen the gap but I believe in helping the poor because some day I will be old and I hope there will be young people who have the same view of life as me, that the better off must ensure the marginalised, the underprivileged and the less well off are looked after. Lip service is no good.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's own words, this Government has copper-fastened social welfare payments and budget increases will be delivered to all the Department's weekly customers. No one disputes that the increases, which, when inflation is discounted, are but a pittance, will be delivered. The amounts involved, however, are unacceptable. The CORI Justice Commission highlighted that the unemployed get a real increase of 30 cent per week. An unemployed couple with one child gains 25 cent a week. Children get a real increase of 54 cent per week. I hope the bars of chocolate are not too dear where they go to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" />The Minister for Finance told us that the projection for inflation was 4.8%. Now some of our very well-to-do stockbrokers have indicated that it could be more than 6%. Where does that leave the 6% increase? One forecast was for 6.5%, making the increases negative in real terms. Deputy Ring, who does not mince his words, was right; we will have to have a mini-budget. It should be a budget for the poor and the wealthy should be made to pay. They have creamed enough off for long enough. I am always prepared to pay a penny extra at the top rate but I am a socialist. I would not have too many bedfellows in the right wing parties that frequent this House.</P>
    <P>CORI characterised the budget's provisions using the headline &ldquo;Unjust, Unfair, Unacceptable! The Government insults Ireland's poorest people again&rdquo;. I find the provisions of the budget, as far as the poorest of people are concerned, to be insulting. The claim by Government Deputies that it is looking after the weakest in this budget is equally insulting to our intelligence. It takes a hard necked effrontery to claim that the real increase of 25 cent per week, which would not buy a Milky Bar, is looking after the needs of the unemployed family.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has boasted that pensions increased by over 50% during his term, and they did, but he forgot to tell us that the old age pension is now a smaller percentage of the average industrial wage than it was in the late 1970s. Thus, many pensioners without occupational pensions suffer a sharper real drop in their disposable incomes on retirement than they would have 20 years ago. It can be seen that the Minister for Finance has given parsimoniously in this budget with one hand and taken away with great alacrity with the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a budget a day and if we are not careful there will be one in the morning and one in the evening the way things are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Domestic inflation is double the EU average by virtue of the Minister's profligacy and recklessness when times were good. The current budget, by increasing VAT and other charges, will add 1% to inflation and it is now predicted that inflation will run at 6% per annum next year. He was out in his figures for long enough. He had to engage in Paul Daniels trickery to get money from next year and pull it back into this year. I know because I had to pay twice in November. Of course, instead of raising capital gains tax, he tinkers around the edges and looks after his friends by bringing it back. The reduction in capital gains tax was a disgrace. It was done to suit a few on a promise in the Bacon report that it would provide cheap sites for people. What did they do? They garnered the profits themselves <Col N="121" /> and did not give two sugars if people were living in caravans.</P>
    <P>This increase in inflation completely dissipates the social welfare increases in the budget. Many social welfare recipients, as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul acknowledges, will be worse off as a result of this budget. All increases for many social welfare recipients will be clawed back by the changes in rent supplements and the capping of the rent allowance. This has rightly been condemned by housing groups and community welfare officers. I looked at the principal Act and I wonder if what is being done is legal. Whatever legal advice was given to the Minister about implementing this measure should be furnished to the House. People are entitled to a basic level of subsistence to survive and if by capping they are deprived of that, is it in accordance with section 266 of the principal Act? I have my doubts that it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Community welfare officers and health boards will be seeking legal advice about the implementation of this measure and the sooner the better. It is pathetic. The Minister is using a blunt instrument to control rent instead of introducing legislation to deal with rent restriction and control. This will impoverish people and impact solely on the weakest and poorest.</P>
      <P>There will be a cut of 5% in social housing in the coming year in this supposedly socialist budget. I nearly fell out of my chair when I read that someone had the hard neck to call it that. If that is the case, we should all get out of the left wing spectrum. We certainly do not know what socialism is about if the Government can get away with calling this budget socialist. I would not be surprised if they get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recently published review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, the so-called Goodbody report, it was made clear that the majority of the income advocacy group proposed a formal linkage between adult welfare rates and average earnings to ensure the incomes of social welfare recipients keep pace with those of the wider population. If such a proposal had been accepted by the Government, it would have protected to a greater extent the position of social welfare recipients, particularly at a time when the partnership agreement is being renegotiated. While a majority of the income advocacy group proposed a formal linkage between social welfare rates and average earnings, a minority of the group comprising the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IBEC opposed such a linkage on the grounds that the Government must have flexibility to consider the range of high priority demands on the Exchequer. No doubt the minority interests will win &ndash; they <Col N="122" /> always win because they have many friends in Government. It is clear that the winners in this budget have been the minority of big business interests represented in the NAPS review rather than the majority who favour social justice. This puts in context the statements of the Taoiseach in the foreword to the review on NAPS which reads, &ldquo;Building an inclusive society is the key priority of the Government for our country&rdquo;. He should not make such statements unless he intends to honour them.</P>
    <P>There is also a commitment to poverty proofing in the revised NAPS report. This is something which caught my eye. It means that the policy proposals will be analysed to see how they affect the poor. I was very lucky to have training and a grounding in economics. The recent Budget Statement sets out the extent to which the Department of Finance applied the poverty proofing process to the budget. The Department is at best ambiguous and misleading in the way it reported this process. On the one hand, it asserts that the analysis of poverty proofing applies to the social welfare and income tax changes only but, on the other, it refers to tax changes in general rather than income tax only. It asserts that the analysis reflects the highly progressive nature of the budget which sees those dependent on social welfare benefits getting the greatest gain. The Department of Finance is applying smoky mirrors to the process of analysis. Income tax is almost always progressive. Indirect tax increases which characterise this budget, such as the 1% increase in VAT from 12.5% to 13.5%, excise duties and other charges, are highly regressive as they have much greater impact on the poor than on the rich. The impact of the budget on the poor can only be assessed by considering all the changes and adding up the gains and losses. It is the responsibility of the Department of Finance to analyse the impact of all tax changes on the poor and to report objectively and unambiguously on the outcome.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest disappointments in the budget is the miserable way in which children are treated. Child benefit has been increased by &euro;8, which the Minister lauded, bringing the level of benefit to &euro;125.60 for the first and second child. Discounting this for the projected rate of inflation reduces the rate of increase to 54 cent a week, or 67 cent a week for families with three or more children, which by any standard is derisory. The treatment of families in this manner flies in the face of a statement made by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, that child benefit has always been proved the most effective way to support children which does not contribute to work disincentives or poverty traps. She is correct and I applaud her for winning the argument. I was the eldest of ten children and I knew how important the first Tuesday of every month was to my mother. I never hid from that. I will always remember that the <Col N="123" /> eldest child was worth just ten shillings and the second and third were worth much more. This is why I am committed to improving the lot of these people. I am not speaking on a personal but a collective level. The Minister is one of the more affable and genial people in the Government, and I wish her well. She has a tough fight because many people in Government disagree with her. If she needs help, Deputy Ring and I will be ready to sort out some of these hard right-wing ideologues with whom she must deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's views are shared by all those who work with children and families in poverty, including Barnardos, Children's Alliance and the Community Platform. If she believes in this principle, why will she not deliver on it by supporting poor children and families?</P>
      <P>Every week in County Westmeath, Deputy McGrath and I meet parents on low incomes who obtained little benefit from the Celtic tiger. Their incomes may exclude them from eligibility for a medical card because the income limits have not been adjusted sufficiently. Notwithstanding the now discredited national health strategy where we lost 200,000 medical cards, these people may not be able to give their children the minimal medical care and their predicament has been exacerbated significantly by the injustice of inadequacies in the budget. One year ago, the Coalition Government promised a child benefit increase from &euro;31 to &euro;38 per month for each child. Such promises were made for crass electoral purposes and it was never intended that they would be fulfilled. Commenting today on the budget, a St. Vincent de Paul spokesperson said that the Minister for Finance is taking the money which should be paid in child benefit and putting it into roads. He said he is putting cars before kids. This reflects the widespread dismay throughout the country at the treatment being meted out to families in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How we treat children and look after disabled people are two of the measures that reflect a caring society. I see the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, is present. He has missed me over the past five years, which really hurt me. I want the officials to note this point. The way carers in this society have been treated over the years is the greatest blot on our society. This is supposed to be a wealthy economy, even though people are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, with little or no respite care or help. These people are subjected to the ignominy of a means test and are scaled back &euro;10. Hours are spent investigating these people. It almost costs more to carry out these investigations than it would to pay people a few miserable shillings, which is a disgrace. I made it clear to the Labour <Col N="124" /> Party that I would resign if it entered Government and did not abolish the means test. Deputy Wall can vouch that I said as much at a public meeting. That is what the issue means to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy would have a good shot at it. This is something none of us can take pride in because it is a blot on all of us. The Government extended the same miserable treatment in the budget to carers as it extends to other groups who need its support. There will be an increase of &euro;7 per week for carers under the age of 66, including &euro;19 per weekly income disregard, and &euro;38 for a couple under the carer's allowance scheme, &euro;150 income threshold per week for people receiving carer's benefit who want to engage in some level of employment.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 100,000 carers throughout the country who provide loving care to dependants, yet fewer than 20,000 of them qualify for support from the State because of means testing and restrictions imposed by the relevant authorities. In some instances, these tests were more restrictive as a case successfully pursued through the ombudsman confirmed in 2001. This Government, as in the case of its immediate predecessor, the Fianna Fáil-PD Coalition, will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into a more civilised Ireland in the 21st century. The Labour Party has a well thought out programme, caring for our carers. It includes the abolition of the means test for carers, linking carers payments to average earnings and a dramatic expansion of respite care. We will continue to advance and press for the implementation of our programme, even in the face of an uncaring and stingy Minister for Finance. We owe it to the people who have committed themselves to looking after others to give them the minimal back-up which they have a right to expect from a caring State. The carer's association said that the slave labour is alive and well after the budget. The Government failed to recognise thousands of family carers who provide 24 hour care for our most frail and disabled citizens in the home. Following the budget only an extra 1,000 family carers will receive some form of carer's allowance, which translates into a paltry one in ten of carers receiving an allowance. Carers continue to be exploited by the State because those in receipt of a full allowance earn just 77 cent per hour for their caring work in the home. This is about one ninth of the basic minimum wage. This nonsense should be stopped; we should tax the stallions and whatever else is necessary to ensure that carers are looked after. It is the most basic thing. The tax should be ring-fenced and provided as carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party made clear this was fundamental. Many people sneered at my party's six <Col N="125" /> pledges. However, if anyone goes back to read those pledges, this was one of them. There was no fear that the Labour Party would participate in any Government that would not look after carers, even if that meant putting up capital gains tax by 5% or 10% to look after the 100,000 people who are saving the State billions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not taking the money and putting it in some offshore account but are working night and day looking after people. They got no recognition in the budget. The Government should not tinker with this by slipping in a couple of shillings to fob people off with insulting amounts of money. Carers will send that money back. They are being put through the wringer.</P>
      <P>It is time to straighten this matter out. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has a lot of compassion. He knows the situation in this regard in his constituency. The Minister should do something with the means test. It is an indictment on the 166 Deputies that people get so little and it must be tackled.</P>
      <P>The treatment of families, children and older people in our social welfare provision is not just an abstract matter to be discussed in the sheltered environment of Leinster House. It bears on the lives of ordinary people and, more particularly, on the poor and disadvantaged. A case was brought to my attention recently where a mother registered a child with the Department of Social and Family Affairs in May 2002 but will not get the six months arrears due on her lone parents book until January or early February 2003 because there is a six month backlog of cases in the Department. Members will understand what that means to a parent coming up to Christmas. It is serious and I hope the Minister's officials take note.</P>
      <P>What could one say without cringing to an 85 year old woman in receipt of a diabetic allowance who Deputy Wall, a true Labour person in the spirit of Connolly and Larkin who looks out for the elderly and those on the margins, recently met? The elderly woman receives &euro;11.10 per month. He got a phone call this morning to say that the allowance has been reduced because of means testing to &euro;1.80 per month.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a copy of a letter from Deputy Wall written by a widow who is heavily dependent on child maintenance payments and who is trying to put one of her children through third level edu<Col N="126" /> cation. She wrote that a widow's pension is &euro;123.30 weekly and she receives &euro;21.60 for her child. There has been no increase in dependent child allowance for nearly ten years. She receives child benefit until the child is 18 years. The &euro;21.60 allowance continues while the child is in full-time education but the child benefit disappears after the age of 18. How is a widow and mother to send a child to university in these financial circumstances? In her letter, the woman says that her small Civil Service pension does not fully cover her weekly rent and that she is tired of depending on assistance from her family. She has health problems and wants to know who can help her. Deputy Ring is correct that it is people like this who must be helped. It is a hard thing for a woman or anybody to write a letter of that nature, or for Deputy Wall to bring a problem of that nature to us.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to raise such serious matters. These are real life cases and not abstractions. Elected Deputies in contact with their constituents encounter them daily. Colleagues, including the Minister, meet such cases and the inadequacy of social provision can be illustrated with many similar cases. I gives me no pleasure to berate colleagues in this House for the conduct of our financial and social affairs. However, I must take the situation as I find it and I owe it to those who elected me to express my views in the most honest manner possible in the interests of all the people. It is important that inadequacies are tackled.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is a tremendous exponent of individualisation, aided by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. As Deputy Paul McGrath rightly said, if the Government is so in favour of individualisation, the Department of Social and Family Affairs should extend it to the young people of 18 or 19 years of age living with their parents. They can get married, buy a house, attend third level or do what they like but the Department deems them dependants. The eligibility of such young people is calculated with reference to household income. That is the antithesis of individualisation. It is only good when it suits the Government with regard to the tax code, but when it refers to the social welfare code, the motto is: &ldquo;You shall not pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those young people are often forced out of home. They may get on a local authority list, but probably not if they are single.</P>

It is crazy, as is the emasculation of the community employment schemes I spoke about last week and the effective abolition of the back to work scheme, which has 13,350 participants.

      <P>&mdash;because she would have tempered some of their wild excesses. They want to cut everything. The scheme played a major role in assisting people in the transition from long-term unemployment to work. A person now has to be five years out of work to qualify. A person who is five years unemployed needs other forms of assistance to re-enter the workforce. This is another crude and unwise cut and amounts to the effective abolition of the back to work allowance. It will now only be available to lone parents and certain categories in the area of disability.</P>
      <P>I deplore dishonesty and cant in public life and, as with other colleagues in the House, think it outrageous that within a few months of a general election in which this Government promised the electorate decent services, good management of the public finances and good government &ndash; what could reasonably be described as the devil and all as is said down my way &ndash; we are presented with one of the most miserly social welfare budgets of recent memory. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs must know that her social welfare payments are among the lowest in the EU and not adequate to keep those dependent on them out of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Minister owes it to this House to explain how she can stand over the payments that have been made to the poorest section of our community, for which she has special responsibility. She owes it to them to come up with more than statements sanctioned and sanitised by the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party. A little honesty and contrition for social welfare provision in which she can take no pride would restore the credibility of her office.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has left the Chamber. I hope she had an important event to attend. Her promotion to the Cabinet was warranted. She must have been justifiably proud to have been given this portfolio with all its challenges. The Social Welfare Bill and the budget represents her first challenge as Minister in that Department. <Col N="128" /> Unfortunately, she has not succeeded in that challenge. She has only succeeded in ensuring that the gap between those who have and have not in our society has grown less wide than it was during her predecessor's time in office.</P>
      <P>The sixth successive budget introduced by the Minister for Finance has made the gap between those who have and have not in our society wider. The Conference of Religious of Ireland indicated that the five previous budgets increased the gap between those who depend on social welfare payments and those on &euro;50,000 or more by &euro;12,000 a year. The sixth budget has increased that gap by a further &euro;25 a week, which is an additional &euro;1,000. That shows that wealth is being distributed to the better off in our society. While that is not the intention of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the effect is marked and the Government must take responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Government has disappointed people in almost every area of social welfare expenditure. The 5% or &euro;6 increase in social welfare payments is eaten up by indirect tax increases, particularly the 1% increase in VAT. It is also eaten up by increases which were introduced as a result of changes in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. As regards housing, recipients of rent supplements must now pay &euro;12.40 a week compared to &euro;7.60, an increase of &euro;4.80. That will be deducted from the &euro;6 increase in the budget. Inflation and indirect taxes will also have an effect. The Government then dares to say that it protects the less well-off in our society. How dare it have the gall to suggest that it cares for the less well-off in our society. For six budgets in a row it has rubbed the faces of those who have least in our society further into the grind. It has created a two tier society and those at the bottom have been told to stay where they belong without any hope of redemption from a Government which is only interested in helping those who are better off and who are more willing and able to participate in the electoral process and to support the parties in Government. Shame on the Government if that is how it defends democratic values and treats our society in 2002.</P>
      <P>The &euro;500 million the Government boasts about giving to social welfare recipients is exceeded by the amount of money it is putting aside on an annual basis to give to those in the special savings investment scheme. That is a statement of the Government's priorities. It believes that the people who have the capacity to save in our society should be rewarded more than others. It wants to reward those with more funds to save more money. As the Green Party spokesperson on social welfare, I and my party do not wish to see the development of such a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has sung its praises loudly in relation to child poverty. However, a press release today from St. Vincent de Paul in Limerick, which works in conjunction with Focus <Col N="129" /> Ireland, Barnardos, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Children's Rights Alliance and Pavee Point, which works with the Traveller community, stated that budget 2003 will seriously affect children, particularly those living in poverty. They have pulled their punches. The budget underlines the Government's philosophy for the past six years, namely, that we should reward those who have plenty in our society. If the Minister for Social and Family Affairs wants to get a grip on her Department and to improve the lot of those in our society who have less because of the Government's policies, she must do better.</P>
    <P>The &euro;8 increase in child benefit is a quarter of what was promised as a third year increase by the Government two years ago. It is another failed promised by a fraudulent Government. The increase in family income supplement, which helps those on the lowest incomes, is less than the current rate of inflation. That rate will increase as a result of changes in indirect taxation, particularly the 1% increase in VAT, introduced by the Minister for Finance. The back to school clothing and footwear allowance was not increased for children under 12 years of age, although costs are proportionately higher in that age bracket. A zero increase is like a cut, given the increasing rate of inflation. What is the logic for that? </P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose mentioned carers. There is no doubt that we have adopted a cheap approach to social services. We have failed to give increases in line with the rate of inflation and to put in place a system for the cost of each person's care. The Government says it cares and that it provides for the citizens, when it does not.</P>
    <P>The organisations I mentioned are not the only ones to say the budget is a failure. Other organisations, such as Threshold and the Conference of Religious of Ireland, have said that the gap has been identified and made worse by the Government. Those who depend on disability payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs got nothing from the budget. They will have proportionately less because of the worsening rate of inflation as a result of measures introduced by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government may feel it is causing pain and misery in the first year of its term in office before the electoral cycle cranks up again. The Minister for Finance has promised two more budgets in a three year budgetary cycle which will introduce similar increases. I presume we will then see what we saw in the two years before the last general election. Public finances will be cranked up and a devil-may-care attitude will be adopted. A perception will be given that those who are least well off in our society will finally be given something back. However, what is more likely to happen is that those who already have plenty will be given proportionately more.</P>
    <P>Ours is the most unequal society in Europe and the second most unequal among OECD nations <Col N="130" /> after the United States of America, yet the Government benches are almost bare and its representative cannot even look a speaker in the face. That reflects the shame the Government should feel and the scandal of a sixth budget which insults an Ireland that has gone without because of policies which have unashamedly favoured the better off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, Fianna Fáil backbenchers, among them many of the so-called rebels, lined up to congratulate the Minister for Finance on the social welfare increases. They told him that their constituents would welcome the rise in their payments, but I have not found anyone in my constituency who agrees. It is beyond my comprehension that anybody could be expected to be grateful for these measures. On Saturday, I spoke to an unemployed couple with one child and was told that their increase in real terms was 25 cent, which is not much. I do not know of any clothing you could buy with it, in fact, you could not even get a spool of thread. Other speakers spoke of milk and bread, which this increase will not buy. It might pay for a tea bag, but you would still have to supply the milk and sugar. Perhaps those backbenchers who praised this budget can tell me what 25 cent can purchase.</P>
      <P>A single unemployed person with one child will be worse off in 2003 as a result of this budget. While I am sure the Minister for Social and Family Affairs fought her corner in the run up to this budget, no one seems to be listening to her or to any of the groups tackling poverty, social exclusion and disadvantage. Last week's budget provides for paltry increases in social welfare payments which are wiped out when inflation is taken into account. These provisions come against a backdrop of savage cuts in community employment schemes, increases in VAT, stealth taxes on ATM cards, cutbacks in public services and the failure of the Government to take those on low incomes out of the tax net. Today it was revealed that the back-to-work allowance is to be refocused, as the Department puts it. We are supposed to be grateful that there were increases in social welfare rather than its elimination as suggested by the so-called three wise men. Like the original three wise men, they are looking at the stars and cannot see what is happening around them in their community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision not to pay the child benefit increase despite the fact that a quarter of children live in poverty is perhaps the most shocking of the budget's provisions. We were told that the Government committed itself to a three-year implementation plan for child benefit increases and this year's provision was to be the third and final instalment. Faced with a choice, rather than deliver on this commitment the Minister chose to deliver on another part of his programme, the pledge to big business to cut corporation tax, sav<Col N="131" /> ing it a few hundred million euro more. You can side with those who have money or those without and it is clear that the Government sided once again with the well off. The real increase in payments for children is &euro;2.35 a month &ndash; less than 8 cent per day &ndash; despite the fact that the Combat Poverty Agency has repeatedly made the point that child benefit is the fairest way to support disadvantaged families.</P>
    <P>The scandal is that many of these children will often have to go hungry and without decent clothes to schools which are run down, have inadequate heating and are housed in buildings in danger of collapsing. The waiting list for repairs is growing. This budget suggests that the Government believes it is normal for children to be schooled in what are obviously dangerous and unhealthy environments. The child benefit allowance has effectively been frozen since 1994, once increases in the cost of living are considered. The allowance is completely inadequate and despite an eight year old recommendation from the Commission on Social Welfare there are still three distinct rates. Perhaps the Minister can tell the House when we can expect these recommendations to be implemented as well as when the increases in child allowance will be made.</P>
    <P>Another betrayal comes in the form of the increase in carer's allowance. In the run up to the last election there was unanimous agreement across the political divide that carers had been undervalued by successive Governments. There was a determination to do something about it. Many of us called for the abolition of the means test for carer's allowance, but the Government has seen fit only to increase slightly the amount of money provided. In this debate, it is key to bear in mind the utter baloney that the money was not available. It was available to cut corporation tax to the lowest rate in Europe at a cost of &euro;305 million.</P>
    <P>This State has one of the highest per capita income levels in the EU and one of its worst levels of infrastructure and service provision. In its pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin proposed a new tax rate of 50% for very high earners, a capital gains tax of 40% and a freezing of corporation tax. We suggested that people be allowed to back out of the SSIA schemes without penalty and pledged to get rid of tax breaks and loopholes. If this Government had wanted to tackle poverty, to invest in education and to address the largest issue in politics, rampant inequality in society, the money was there. The political will, however, was not. It would have meant taking on the Government's financial backers and forcing corporate Ireland to pay its fair share. The Minister for Finance was clearly not prepared to move away from rewarding the rich to supporting the less well off.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, long-term unemployed couples are &euro;72 better off while a couple earning &euro;50,000 is &euro;271 a week better off. The latter couple is also <Col N="132" /> more likely to have benefited even further by investing in the special savings scheme set up by this Government. These are the facts behind the last six budgets and this year we have seen another chapter in the ongoing failure of this Government to take every worker on the minimum wage out of the tax net. The Minister claims this budget takes those earning 90% of the minimum wage out of the tax net, which is what he said on 5 December 2001. Last year he told the House that the tax changes he was introducing then meant that those on 90% of the minimum wage were out of the tax net. Is this political groundhog day? In each of the coming years can we expect Deputy McCreevy, having learned nothing from his previous year, to stand before us looking again and again for plaudits for this big break for minimum wage earners?</P>
    <P>It is the low paid and the unpaid that I represent and over the weekend I heard their anger and hurt at the sad, pathetic social welfare increases in this budget. Many of the cutbacks outlined in the budget will result in a reduced level of health care, education and public services which will affect those who are already poor or are experiencing social exclusion. This budget expects the poor to bear the burden of Government mismanagement of the unprecedented resources which were available during the boom years. It will perpetuate inequality and leave thousands of families trapped in poverty. The budget is littered with broken promises and it leaves the less well off poorer than they were before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>A mark of a just and fair society is how it treats its most needy and vulnerable citizens, but those who expected this budget to reflect that were sorely disappointed. It is a gross understatement to say that its provisions have let the weaker members of our society down. The Social Welfare Bill is of dubious benefit to those who need our help most of all. The measly &euro;6 increase in social welfare will be negatived completely by inflation and the increase in the lower rate of VAT and considering that it will be spent on basics like coal, gas and electricity, it will not go very far. Those who receive social welfare will pay increased ATM charges when they draw cash from the benefit owed to them. It is a case of a two handed Government &ndash; it gives with one hand and takes away with the other. This is par for the course for previous Governments in recent years, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The community platform, CORI and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, were all of one mind. Despite their pleas nothing has changed. In fact the &euro;130 minimum welfare payment threshold recommended was ignored. So much for fair play for the less well-off. It was all gobbled up by the better off. The increase of &euro;6 will be further eroded by the increased accommodation costs arising from cutbacks in the rent allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" />How about the magnificent carers of Ireland who got a miserly increase of &euro;7? This is a small increase especially when the carers had to go through so much to get the allowance in the first place. The conditions for eligibility are strict. The carers do magnificent work day in day out, seven days a week, year after year. If those carers were to refuse to do that work the State could not even cope not to mention paying for it. These wonderful people were ignored in the budget.</P>
    <P>While disability and unemployment benefit has increased by &euro;6, many more are driven on to the dole by the Government's policy of forcing people off community employment schemes. Nobody denies the magnificent work done through the community employment scheme in every community, the clean up and essential services provided in schools which are cash starved. Those who had been engaged in that work will be demoralised by going into the ranks of the unemployed. Would it not have been better to preserve people's dignity by allowing those schemes to continue? It was stated that the justification for those schemes was that the unemployment rate was going down. This is not a justification as the number of unemployed is increasing.</P>
    <P>What about the older folk? It is true they will receive an increase of &euro;10 but after inflation and rent allowance changes they will get very little. On the question of allowing older people remain in their own community, this is a missed opportunity of magnanimous proportions. There are 2,000 units for older people in Ireland yet 2,000 older people are languishing on the local authority housing list waiting for the opportunity to remain in their own area but who are forced into nursing homes. The slowdown in social housing could have been corrected by the introduction of the defined revenue funding scheme. This would have been about one tenth of the cost of the &euro;70 million used to keep the elderly in nursing homes. They would have been much better off had they been allowed remain in their own communities.</P>
    <P>There was no vision in this budget and more is the pity. Young and old will suffer and we will become even more a society of the haves and the have nots. That is regrettable as this budget is another lost opportunity to create a more just and equitable society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Social Welfare Bill. It is essential that we all examine this legislation carefully and decide how we distribute finance to the most needy in society. Sadly, we seem to be moving away from the idea of society and the words &ldquo;social&rdquo; and &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; sound hollow indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, in the budget, we saw how our society is going. We will now have a situation where an unemployed person with one child will be 25 cent per week better off in real terms than in 2002. The <Col N="134" /> poverty gap between a single unemployed person and a person on &euro;50,000 per year will widen by more than &euro;25 per week. The number of people living in relative poverty will continue to rise. On top of this there will be a substantial loss of essential services in local communities which were delivered up to now by community employment schemes. This is not the kind of country in which I wish to live. This is not social and above all it has nothing to do with the welfare of our people. Hence, I will vote against the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for increases in the rates of social insurance and social assistance payments and improvements in the family income supplement scheme. Sections 2 and 3 provide for increases in rates of social welfare payments, including the increase of &euro;10 per week for pensioners aged 66 and over and for people on retirement and invalidity pension aged 65 and over. This increase is too low. These people have worked hard all their lives, paid their taxes and gave great service to the State and their community and will now receive &euro;10 which is worth about three pints or two packets of cigarettes. This is not good enough and, above all, it is not fair.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for increases in the weekly net income thresholds used to determine entitlement to family income supplement. The new thresholds range from &euro;379 in the case of a family with one child to &euro;556 in the case of a family with eight or more children. The rates of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, injury benefit, health and safety benefit are being increased by &euro;6 to &euro;124.80 per week. This is not good enough and, above all, it is an injustice to the less well-off in society. The weekly rates of widow's and widower's pensions are being increased by &euro;7. This is the equivalent of about two drinks or a packet of cigarettes. This increase shows where our priorities lie. The disablement pension is being increased by &euro;7. I ask the Minister if she would be able to live on those increases. That is &euro;130.30 to survive in 2002. Most Ministers and senior Deputies would spend that amount on a meal out in one night, yet we expect it to last widows for seven days. That is not on and it is unacceptable. It is time for the Government to come into the real world and to stop hiding behind its minders and spin doctors. Given inflation, these increases are a joke.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of the carer's allowance has been increased by &euro;7 to &euro;129.60 per week. These people save the Exchequer at least &euro;300 per week, yet the State offers them &euro;7. Any private nursing home costs between &euro;400 and &euro;500 per week. That is the reality and that is the real world. These injustices have got to be highlighted and the real percentages have to be made clear. Our people, our elderly, our carers have got to have a voice both in the Dáil and in the wider community. Any Dáil that does not look after its carers and elderly loses the respect of its people. <Col N="135" /> Any Government that does not respect its elderly loses its heart and it goes out of business. This Social Welfare Bill should be about helping people, giving them a leg up, not turning our backs on them. This Bill should be about radical change.</P>
    <P>We have got to challenge the negative attitudes to ageing and older people and to promote greater participation by older people in society. A person over 65 has to be valued and looked after. If we can make them financially independent we all win &ndash; the people win, the country wins and the voluntary community groups up and down the country win. It is a good investment and it is money well spent. Society gains if we value, care for and provide proper welfare payments. This is the direction in which the Bill should be going. However, it is a missed opportunity. We could give people the final leg up to prevent poverty and exclusion in society. The Bill will be passed because the Government has the required numbers. However, I urge the Minister to think again and to provide a decent increase, then we would all win.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not spun by anybody. As the Deputy knows, it is my own work. This budget has continued, within the constraints of the current economic climate, to give recipients of social welfare the best possible support. My party colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has made it her priority to protect and safeguard social welfare payments. Despite the increasing pressures on the economy, this Government is delivering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sacrifices and hard work of pensioners and previous generations, on whose shoulders the ongoing development and prosperity of this coun<Col N="136" /> try has been built, more than justify the Government's commitment to raise the pension to &euro;200 during its lifetime. I support the Minister who will ensure that the increase for next year will bring the pension rate closer to that target.</P>
    <P>The changes in the disregard for rent mortgage interest supplement and the increase in weekly rent supplement limits will serve to alleviate the conditions of the pensioners affected. The widening of the telephone allowance for all pensioners under the age of 70 in receipt of a social welfare payment, and to pensioners over 70 years of age in nursing homes with their own telephone account, demonstrates that this Minister and her officials are aware of the practicalities of a pensioner's life and will bring forward solutions. The extension of free schemes to under 70 year olds, with limited conditions, is also welcome.</P>
    <P>I have a specific interest in the issue of carers as I have had personal experience in that regard. The Minister and her officials have recognised the central role carers have in providing first rate care. The increase in the respite care grant, coupled with the weekly increase, demonstrates the Government's support for this valuable personal service.</P>
    <P>I represent the Tallaght area in Dublin South-West. For many years we have talked a lot about unemployment. Over the last 12 years, since the opening of the Square in 1990, Tallaght has become a different place. Unemployment is no longer the problem it was and people in my constituency are finding employment. Despite that we have a first class social welfare service in Tallaght which delivers excellent services to people. The level of unemployment has dropped significantly over the years and has not risen sharply to date. I urge the Minister to continue her policy of support for the long-term unemployed, through both payment rates and training and support activities whether personal development or literacy courses organised by FÁS.</P>
    <P>The Government has used child benefit as an effective way to support children in a way that is not a disincentive to work or a poverty trap and there has been a significant increase in child benefit payments. While the increase this year has been smaller than previous years I welcome the Minister for Finance's commitment to catch up with our child benefit commitments in the budgets of 2004 and 2005. Two thirds of the promised increases have already been delivered. Child benefit is now &euro;125.60 for the first child, a change from the previous benefit of &euro;38.09. My constituency of Dublin South-West covers the large estates of Tallaght as well as the areas of Templeogue, Firhouse and Greenhills and people talk to me and give me their reactions. In these areas there are few homes where there are not recipients of a social welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>While I have only commented on some aspects of this Bill I support the Minister and her officials <Col N="137" /> who on a daily basis deliver services to an ever demanding customer base. Notwithstanding the exceptions there will always be when dealing with such a large and diverse base, I am not afraid to say they deliver the services in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
    <P>I have said before that being a Deputy on the Government benches can be demanding. However, it does not stop me from honouring my commitments to my constituents. It is now 207 days since I was elected. The people of Tallaght sent me here to do a job and being on the Government benches does not prevent me from doing that or prevent me from listening to my constituents. I listen to them on the phone, in the streets and in my seven weekly advice clinics. I can still come in and bring their concerns to the attention of the Ministers and the Dáil. I will continue to do that.</P>
    <P>A debate on a Bill such as this gives us all an opportunity to voice our concerns. We have a Minister who is listening and who is prepared to take action and I wish her well. I hope she takes the opportunity to piece together all the contributions and that she ensures her Department continues to provide a first class service for people in need. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>A measure of any Government's commitment to social justice, to eliminating social exclusion and to promoting social solidarity and burden sharing is the way it looks after those least well able to look after themselves. By any measure, a Government, which in difficult circumstances is able to devote a budget day package of &euro;530 million to social welfare, is clearly committed to those less able to look after themselves. That amount is one of the largest made available for social welfare in recent years. I commend the Government and the Minister for that commitment.</P>
      <P>There are still people in relative poverty in our constituencies and we need to support them. I welcome the increase of &euro;10 per week for old age pensioners. It builds on the progress we have already made. The increases focus on specific target areas in terms of social welfare recipients. Old age pensioners have received good increases over the last number of years which is only what they deserve. We would like to be able to give more. As Deputy O'Connor said they have built the country to what it is. I also welcome the extra &euro;11 per week for widows and widowers over 66 years of age. I know the Minister has a particular interest in that group of people. Recently, I heard her say that widows and widowers under 66 years of age also need attention.</P>
      <P>I have heard some entertaining back-of-the-lorry comments from my colleagues on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad I have provoked them out of their evening slumber. Since they quoted selectively <Col N="138" /> from the CORI analysis of the budget, I will quote equally selectively from the same document on the initiatives which CORI welcomed. The promised levy on financial institutions which have benefited inordinately from the reduction in corporation tax in recent years will realise &euro;300 million. The promised disbursement of funds from the dormant accounts fund to charitable and community projects will have a particular focus on children with learning disability. Other initiatives which have been welcomed include the move to close tax loopholes which were created by the rainbow Government, the proposed introduction of a carbon energy tax from the end of 2004 and the increased excise duty on alcopops, to which Deputy Ring will possibly object also.</P>

      <P>I will mention one further matter for Deputy Ring's benefit. There was an anomaly in last year's Social Welfare Act, which I humbly claim to have brought to the Minister's attention, whereby people were excluded from schemes formerly available to them. I am pleased to note that the free schemes are now to be extended to pensioners under the age of 70 in receipt of a qualifying payment and whose spouse or partner is in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right where the total income of the spouse and partner is less than &euro;203.16 per week. That will come into operation from January. Many others had ignored that anomaly and I am glad the Minister has addressed that concern for an estimated 2,500 people. That measure is very similar to one we introduced in a previous budget in relation to pre-1953 pensions.</P>

      <P>Comhairle has also done great work. Although some Members may not welcome it, the provision of impartial, objective advice and information to our constituents is a great step forward. We should continue to promote services such as those provided by Comhairle. I partially welcome the initiative in relation to the child dependant allowance. The Minister is aware of my views in this regard. I know there was a policy decision in 1994 that this allowance would not be increased because, at that time, it was seen as a disincentive to work. I have discussed the matter with previous Ministers who tried to explain that reasoning. I suggest that the Minister could usefully look at the situation of people with long-term disability who will never be available for work. They should be considered for inclusion in the child dependant allowance category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back-to-work allowance has been a very useful initiative, although it may have run its course in certain areas. When it was introduced in my area, unemployment was close to 10% but it is now down to around 1.7% and I realise there are good reasons for reviewing the scheme. However, there is a category of applicants who still need the cushioning effect of the back-to-work allowance. I refer to those on the enterprise allowance. It may be reasonable to argue that a <Col N="140" /> person who has been long-term unemployed and secures a full-time job might be able to cope with the loss of social welfare payment. However, a person starting up his or her own business will not have a cheque at the end of the first week and may not have any income for quite some time. The proposed change would leave such people in a vulnerable situation. In my local partnership area, some 80 small time entrepreneurs &ndash; unemployed people &ndash; were assisted to set up in business in 2002. Perhaps the Minister will have another look at that aspect of the scheme if she is in a position to review it.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Minister has introduced a balanced series of measures. It is a targeted package which is focused on the most vulnerable people. I would prefer to see 100% of the minimum wage free of tax rather than 90%. However, we are moving a substantial distance in the right direction. I hope other measures such as child benefit allowances will be improved in due course. I compliment the Minister on her work and I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>This has been an interesting debate. I find it difficult to understand how anybody can welcome a budget which puts &euro;6 into the pocket of a lone parent one day only to take away &euro;4.80 the next day. That net increase of &euro;1.20 is before inflation at 6% is taken into account. CORI has welcomed some few items. However, the heading on its statement very clearly describes the budget as unfair, unjust and unacceptable. I welcome the Minister to her portfolio and I am glad she has taken it. This is the first time I have spoken in this context other than on Question Time. I have worked closely with her on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and elsewhere and I have heard her laugh and enjoy life. I have no doubt there is a soft and pleasant side to her but&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;this budget does not show that. I welcome the officials to the House. The majority of those involved in the social welfare service give an excellent service throughout the country. In the past few months they have been the victims of pressure exerted on them to cut back and save money which is sad because many of them are helpful. We have a costly jail system. The vast majority of those in jail have been socially excluded. Such are the people we are talking about tonight, those who suffer as a result of low-income, poor structures, lack of remedial education and poor quality schools. Government is about improving those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no apology, because of my background, for referring to some of the schemes that affect the farming sector. I look with interest at the figures in last year's budget which claimed 2,500 <Col N="141" /> extra families would be in receipt of family income supplement, while only 400 extra actually received it. Family income supplement should be available to anyone on low income whether they are shopkeepers or self-employed because they are not covered by any other scheme. Farming people have farm assist which came about as the result of 40,000 farmers marching on the streets of Dublin. The IFA, an organisation in which I spent much time and have much time for, swallowed the Government message that instead of family income supplement farm families would get special treatment and that 40,000 of them would be on farm assist in no time. About 7,500 were on small farm incomes then and today we have 8,500 on farm assist. Some widows and people on disability opted for farm assist because the allowances were slightly better. There is no comparison between the income someone can have on farm assist and someone who is self-employed and can get family income supplement. There is no incentive to do anything on the small farm if one is being paid farm assist.</P>
    <P>How much money was spent on the promotion of the farm assist scheme to people who were entitled to it this autumn? The Minister accepts that a number of farmers came through a desperate period and needed assistance but the records show that they did not take it up. That may have had to do with advertising but the Minister looked well in the papers&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not deliver the goods to the farmers and that is what counts. The small farmers did not benefit from the scheme because they were afraid to apply. I was told by a family which is on &euro;47 per week that they are afraid to look for any more in case they lose it. They know what their income is and they can produce figures but the last time they met with the social welfare officials they decided to leave well enough alone. That must be examined.</P>
      <P>My party put forward a proposal that family income supplement should be available to everyone. I know the Government does not trust accountants and that is why it will not accept audited accounts. I clearly remember when audited accounts came in for farmers and the then Minister said we did not need to produce audited accounts to know the figures. We all know what the then Taoiseach thought about accounts. Accounts from small farmers or business people should be trusted and nobody should lose out as a result of the lack of trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" />I listened with interest to the talk of full employment and there not being a need for the back-to-work scheme anymore. When the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat coalition took over in 1997 some 1,000 jobs per week were created by the previous Government. That brought about low unemployment. The present Government has brought about a situation where 500 jobs per week are being lost. We are in a different economic climate yet we are doing away with the back-to-work allowance. Someone has to be on unemployment benefit for five years in order to be eligible. The Minister, quite rightly in some cases, is sending her officials to make sure that someone who is on it for a few weeks is taken off unless they can prove they are looking for a job. Some people are unemployable and that must be taken into account. People should not be left on the scrap heap. They should be given some encouragement. On the other hand, 5,000 CE schemes are being taken away so there is less opportunity for people to get work.</P>
    <P>A person on disability benefit doing 12 hours per week proper employment with which he could cope was recently told he should go back to work full time and was removed completely because he was making some effort. Where is the fair play in that? Some 5,000 people are being taken off CE schemes and 5,000 more will be taken from the Civil Service. That must be addressed.</P>
    <P>At a political meeting recently, a colleague said we had two budgets and I said that, since it got back into power, the Government has a budget every week and that it might soon have one every day. At that stage, I did not realise there actually was a budget every day because I awoke the next morning to the news that car tax was increased by 12%. If one is on social welfare living in rural Ireland one needs a car. If one is under 66 and a widow or widower one might need a car to bring children to school or work. People who received an increase of only &euro;6 have to pay a 12% increase in car tax and a 35% increase in insurance along with increased food prices. The sum of &euro;6 is an insult to those sort of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who is not in the Chamber, to explain why he did not publish a report that has been in his possession since last March. The report claims that the new electronic system is not tamper-proof. I ask him to publish in full the report on electronic voting by the information security company Zerflow. The report has raised concerns about the new electronic system. I was astounded to discover today that this report <Col N="143" /> was submitted to the Minister on 27 March this year, well in advance of the general election and the Nice treaty referendum, for which electronic voting was widely used.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister was here to clarify a number of questions as a matter of urgency. Why was this report not published? Why were these electronic voting systems used in the general election and the referendum? Were the problems identified by Zerflow resolved before the general election?</P>
      <P>This report has been wrongfully suppressed by the Government so I am calling on the Minister to publish it now, in full. Members of the House must be able to judge whether or not it is safe to proceed with the electronic voting system, and in order to do so we must obtain the honest account contained in that report. Nothing less than a full explanation as to why the report was suppressed, and its immediate publication, will suffice.</P>
      <P>While the report is confidential, I understand it examined the vulnerability of the electronic voting system from a number of perspectives. I have been informed that the lid of the voting machine used in polling stations could be lifted and the ballot paper removed and substituted with a bogus one. The machines are unable to distinguish between genuine ballot paper and bogus ones.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that the machine contained two cartridges, one of which was taken to the main count centre and the other remained in the machines. Keys used to unlock the cartridges were of poor quality and could easily be duplicated. As a result the original cartridge could be removed from the machine.</P>
      <P>In view of this report, has the Department of the Environment and Local Government carried out an assessment of the electronic voting system? If so, what were the findings? Has any assessment been carried out of the security of the central computer at the main count centre? If such an assessment was carried out, the Minister should publish that report also.</P>
      <P>How could the Minister announce an extension of the electronic voting system to cover all constituencies in the next local and European elections, if a major question mark is hanging over the security of the system? The Minister should provide us with a full report on his findings as well as publishing the Zerflow report in full. The Minister should also appear before the Committee on the Environment and Local Government to answer questions on this issue. The security company involved should also appear before that committee to answer questions on aspects of its report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have the report because it was suppressed by the Department but I am demanding that it now be published in full. In recent days we have seen that this Government cannot be trusted <Col N="144" /> with anything it does. It lied and deceived the public prior to the general election, and it would do anything to stay in power.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht deis a thabhairt dom páirt a ghlacadh san díospóireacht seo atá ardaithe ar an Athló ag an Teachta Allen. The matter to which the Deputy referred has attracted a considerable amount of media coverage in the last few days. I welcome the opportunity to bring some balance to that reporting and I want to reassure Deputies that the electronic voting system is accurate, reliable and secure.</P>
      <P>From the outset, security has been paramount in the design, testing and implementation of the new system. The testing programme, in particular, has been rigorous. The voting machine has been tested by two international test institutes, PTB in Germany and TNO in the Netherlands, both of whom have certified the machine as suitable for use.</P>
      <P>Zerflow, an information security company, was requested by my Department in March 2002 to carry out a further security assessment of the procedures to be applied in the use of voting machines in the physical environment of polling stations. This was a subsidiary and less extensive exercise than the other tests to which I have referred, carried out by PTB and TNO. It was carried out at a cost of some &euro;4,000 plus VAT over 14 days.</P>
      <P>The report was received on 27 March 2002 and it contained 16 recommendations. A small number of these were embodied in my Department's subsequent instructions to returning officers. An analysis of the report's main recommendations, however, revealed an inadequate understanding of the organisation of election preparations, including arrangements in polling stations.</P>
      <P>The concerns raised by the Zerflow report were fully assessed by the Department and the machine manufacturers. They were not considered to present any realistic threat to the security of the voting process, having regard to the design of the machine and to the security arrangements operating in polling stations.</P>
      <P>It was also relevant to this assessment that similar machines are used extensively in Germany and the Netherlands. The concerns raised by Zerflow have not been identified in risk assessments in these countries.</P>
      <P>As most of the focus of media attention has been directed to the first recommendation in the report, I would like to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation contained three parts, as follows: a perspex or glass cover should be placed over the ballot paper and the cover should be secured and alarmed; regular checks should be made to ensure nobody defaced or interfered with the surface of the protective glass; and regular checks should be made to ensure that the voting buttons represent the correct candidates and that candidate information is correct. The latter two items have in fact been addressed in my Department's instructions to returning officers.</P>
      <P>As regards the first item, the present cover used for the machine ballot paper is considered adequate. It is not accepted that the ballot paper can be easily interfered with. The security arrangements in polling stations involve the deployment of a full-time poll clerk to supervise the use of each voting machine. Given the highly intrusive operations which would be necessary to remove the ballot paper cover from the machine, interference of the kind suggested could not occur without active collusion of polling station staff. The well supervised and honest administration of polling stations, under the authority of returning officers, is a key prerequisite for the good conduct of elections, in relation both to manual and electronic voting.</P>
      <P>My Department's conclusion, therefore, was that the main scenarios identified by Zerflow were implausible, and that the probability of their occurrence without detection was so remote as to be properly discountable. Electronic voting is rightly seen as a progressive and welcome modernisation of our electoral process. I acknowledge that it is integral to the acceptability of the new system that there should be confidence in its security, as well as in its greater accuracy and efficiency.</P>
      <P>Deputies should also bear in mind that the electronic voting machines in their present form will be replaced at the 2004 elections by new or upgraded machines. As part of the process of acquiring and commissioning these machines, we will of course look again at security issues.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue in the House because there is palpable anger in County Roscommon about the withdrawal of funding for three national schools, Roxboro national school, Ballyfeeney national school and Cloonyquin national school. All three national schools were given the green light prior to the general election, along with 92 other <Col N="146" /> schools that have already gone to construction throughout the country. Colleagues of the Minister's party in Government made announcements in the local papers that sanction had been given by the Department of Education and Science to go to tender for these three schools, on the basis that it would be a formality that they would proceed to construction once the tender documents and bids were in order. I raised this issue in the House on 24 June and the Minister informed me that the schools in question were part of the extensive building programme for 2002, which had been approved earlier in the year. However, on 19 November the Minister, in a reply to me in the House, said that he could give no indication when the construction of these projects would commence. We now see it as a further U-turn by the Government on commitments giver prior to the election. It subsequently withdrew funding on its return to power. It is evident from the Minister's reply last June that funding was in place and yet, subsequent to the cutbacks during the summer, the funding was withdrawn. The three schools in County Roscommon have now been left high and dry and a blatant untruth was told to the people of County Roscommon. The parents, students and teachers have been given further broken promises. In its pre-election promises on education the Government stated it would ensure that no child would be in a substandard school. All three schools in question are in an atrocious condition.</P>
      <P>Irish schools in general compare very badly with those throughout the EU. We have some of the largest class sizes and fewest back-up services in the European Union. The classroom I was in last night in Roxboro national school caters for 20 pupils yet there are over 30 pupils in it. The children's work cannot be hung on the walls of those schools because of sheer dampness. The work will not stick to the walls because they are so damp. The special needs children have to work in the corners of the hall due to the inadequate space in the school. In some of the other schools the special needs children have to be taught in cloakrooms. It is totally unacceptable in 2002 that pupils have to be treated in such an inhuman manner while receiving a basic level of education. These special needs children are already marginalised in school. To be taken out of a classroom and shoved into the corner of a hall or into a cloakroom further marginalises them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school in Roxboro, which I visited yesterday, closed two weeks ago due to a rat infestation. Part of the school in which the pupils are being taught is 150 years old. It has already been condemned and it is totally unsatisfactory to cater for the needs of the present pupils. I am appalled that hundreds of pupils and teachers throughout County Roscommon are forced to risk their health and safety by spending their school hours <Col N="147" /> in grossly substandard classroom accommodation in tens of primary schools throughout the county.</P>
    <P>There has been a &euro;70 million cut in the budget for primary schools building programmes in 2003 and 2004. Next year &euro;148 million is set aside for the construction of new schools and the refurbishment of existing schools. That could easily be subvented by the Government if it is prepared to do it and the Minister for Finance is prepared to tackle the issue of the SSIA schemes. If that scheme was withdrawn tomorrow morning it would save &euro;150 million that could be ploughed into the schools building programme and would relieve the problems. I put this to the Minister in light of the fact that his colleagues in Government prior to the election gave a firm and solemn commitment that the schools in Roxboro, Cloonyquin and Ballyfeeney would receive approval. They have been given the green light for going to tender and the procedures in the Department of Education and Science ensure that funding is set aside once sanction is given to go to tender. They should be approved immediately in line with that commitment so that construction can start early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science on the proposed building projects at these primary schools. Ballyfeeney national school has a staffing level of a principal, two mainstream class teachers and a shared learning support teacher. The enrolment at 30 September was 68 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of two permanent classrooms and one temporary classroom.</P>
      <P>Cloonyquin national school has a staffing level of a principal, one mainstream class teacher and a shared learning support teacher. The enrolment at 30 September was 31 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of two small permanent classrooms.</P>
      <P>Roxboro national school has a staffing level of a principal, three mainstream class teachers and a shared learning support teacher. The enrolment at 30 September was 104 pupils. The school's facilities consist of three permanent classrooms, a staff room and remedial/resource room. The fourth classroom is currently located in the community centre.</P>
      <P>Tender reports for the three schools are with the building unit of the Department of Education and Science. The Minister will announce his expenditure proposals for school buildings in the new year and a decision will be communicated to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has an extensive primary school building programme under way which includes about 400 major building projects in architectural planning, details of which are avail<Col N="148" /> able on the Department's website. I know there was serious criticism of this in the Private Member's motion. I will bring all of this to the Minister's attention and he will participate in the debate here tomorrow evening. Unfortunately he was unavoidably absent this evening. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the position to the House. I hope there will be more definite news in the new year.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Another election promise has been broken. In September 2000 the Government published a White Paper entitled Supporting Voluntary Activity, which was the framework for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector. A group was set up comprising six representatives from the community and voluntary sector and six from the State. Advertisements in relation to funding appeared in the newspapers. The group agreed on how the funding would be spent. Last year, because of the approaching election, the Government decided not to bother allocating that money until the new year. In November of this year we were told that no money would be allocated, that this funding would have to be re-advertised and that the Minister would set new criteria. I want answers to a number of questions.</P>
      <P>First, I want to know who will decide the new criteria. Has the Minister accepted the White Paper on the voluntary sector? We now live in a society where people are busy. We should be encouraging, thanking and supporting anybody who is prepared to volunteer. Everybody is so busy in life that it is not easy to persuade people to become involved in the voluntary sector. We should be encouraging them. Is the Minister supportive of the White Paper? Does he want this to work or does he want to take total control of where funding goes? There are many worthy voluntary organisations that have applied to the Department for funding. To date they have received no notification from the Department as to whether they need to reapply, what the new criteria are, when grant aid will be allocated and how much support the State will give them. That is very unfair and the Minister should deal with it as quickly as possible. He should reassure these people that he wants to work with and support them, that he is thankful for their help and that they are there in a voluntary capacity, because the days when people volunteered are gone. It is very difficult, in any sector of society, whether in the city or rural areas, to get people involved in the community sector. The Minister should be encouraging, helping and supporting people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the Government's priorities in relation to the White Paper? What is the time scale for it to be implemented? When will the grant aid be given? Will it be advertised again? <Col N="149" /> Will groups who have applied have to reapply or will their original application be considered? What are the criteria and who decides them? Has the Minister met the group in question comprising six community representatives and six representatives of the State? If not, when will he meet them and work this out?</P>
    <P>The Minister should be out there, as I know he is. He is somebody who talks my language. He is for the community, for rural Ireland and cities in Ireland. He wants the community to become involved in schemes. This is an opportunity for the Minister to put his money where his mouth is. He has set up a committee which has been approved by Government. The programme for Government and the partnership in relation to the national wage agreement have agreed that this sector should be represented at the State table. These people work in a voluntary capacity. I am asking the Minister to take them out of their misery, tell them what is happening, work with them. We are glad to have them. I wish there were more people prepared to work in the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>We must know the extent of the Minister's commitment to this. Does he want it to work or not? Has he his own agenda that he wants to implement? These people feel left out. I ask the Minister to clarify this and to meet these people immediately. A sum of &euro;7 million was put in place but none of it has been spent yet. I want to know what happened to that money last year. Has it gone back into the Exchequer, will it be carried forward next year, or will it be allocated between now and the end of the year? I hope the Minister will allocate it because there are many voluntary groups that have applied who need the money, support and help.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, as somebody who supports rural development, to support the voluntary sector. It is very difficult now to get anybody to do anything in a voluntary capacity. We should support, help and work with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise. I had been informed that this question would be fourth. When I saw the Deputy on the monitor I ran, not from the Deputy, but to the Chamber.</P>
      <P>I have an official reply here. The Deputy's contribution indicates that he is already aware of what is contained in part of it, that he is aware of the publication of the White Paper and of the fact that the Implementation Advisory Group (IAG) was set up. I will not, therefore, read the part of the reply that refers to the number of people on the group and so on because that is not what the Deputy wants to hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has met on 15 occasions since its establishment in July 2001. Much of the detailed work of the group has been carried out by sub-committees formed to examine specific issues and <Col N="150" /> report to the main group. Some of the key areas of work to date include the federations and networks scheme. The Deputy has raised the question of this scheme on the Adjournment. The idea of the scheme is to provide funding to support the role of federations and networks in the community and voluntary sector. It is one of a number of measures introduced by the White Paper with the objective of supporting and developing the sector.</P>
    <P>The scheme attracted 152 applications which required detailed examination and assessment which was carried out with the assistance of the White Paper's implementation and advisory group. The group, which consists of both statutory and voluntary representatives, is tasked with advising on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>At the end of the process I was given a detailed dossier, which I read while on holiday. That shows how dedicated I am to my job. Having read it, I felt there were some very serious legal issues arising from the methodology employed. On my return I asked for legal advice on this. It was felt that there were issues relating to how the whole process had been carried forward that could give rise to a legal challenge in the future. These were real and serious issues. In order to ensure that there would be no legal challenge once a decision was made, and that nobody would feel they had got less than proper and full treatment, it was considered necessary to re-advertise the scheme and to seek fresh applications.</P>
    <P>The scheme will, therefore, be re-advertised at the earliest possible date. Criteria for the scheme will be established by my Department in consultation with the voluntary sector representatives on the IAG. There are some issues, such as definition of networks and federations and organisations. These are quite tricky to codify in a fair and equal manner. The advice from the IAG will be important. However, we must ensure that, once we decide the criteria, we stick with them until the end of the process. We cannot change the goal posts after advertising. That is my only concern about this issue.</P>
    <P>I also want to make sure that the criteria we lay down will be seen as inclusive, fair and objective. The Minister has a legitimate role in deciding the criteria, having taken advice. The process should proceed automatically after that. That is what I will seek to do. Any allegation that either I or the Minister of State would personally pick one group or another is the opposite to what we want to do. We want to establish the criteria and whatever is published is how it will work, subject to advice from the group.</P>
    <P>We will be funding the scheme in 2003. I have set aside funding for the scheme but it will be at a reduced level, not at the level outlined in the White Paper. I regret the delay in arriving at a <Col N="151" /> decision. The funding was to have been allocated over three years and the Deputy is aware that some of that funding was not spent this year.</P>
    <P>We are making new funding available and we intend to continue to fund this scheme during the period in which it will run. The situation is slightly different in relation to the second parallel scheme, dealing with training and support. There was a strong response to the advertisement for training and support schemes, with 540 applications received. It has been decided that, in order to expedite the assessment of such a large number of applications and in the interests of achieving a demonstrably independent assessment process, consultants should be recruited to make an assessment of all applications received and to make recommendations to me at the earliest possible date. My Department is making the necessary arrangements for the recruitment of suitable consultants for the completion of this task and funding for the scheme will be made available in 2003 at a reduced rate.</P>
    <P>We have decided to defer until after 2003 the funding for a programme of research, as recom<Col N="152" /> mended in the White Paper. A good deal of research into these matters is ongoing in the universities in any event. Studies are also taking place into the multiplicity of sources of State funding and the production of a funding manual for the voluntary sector is being considered.</P>
    <P>As somebody who is still involved in a small way in the voluntary sector and who lives in a small community, as well as in my role as a Minister and a public representative, one of the most significant problems I encounter is the multiplicity of options for funding, all of which comes from the State in the first instance. This causes a significant amount of unnecessary work for local communities. The Deputy can rest assured that everything I bring to the voluntary sector is informed by my 23 years as a worker in the voluntary sector, during all of my working career. I also worked at night in the sector in a voluntary capacity. I always ask myself how I would feel about certain measures if I was still working in the system. I would like to see greater simplicity and a much better focus on the schemes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of interest on overpayments of tax was the subject of a recent report by the Ombudsman. I gave my initial response to this report in a statement I issued on 6 November. I also wrote to the Ombudsman on 6 November indicating that I would study his report carefully. As the Deputies are aware, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they were unable to implement certain recommendations of the Ombudsman's report on the basis that they do not have the statutory authority in these cases to pay interest in respect of tax repaid.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, is examining the contents of the report. Indeed, the general issues raised by the Ombudsman are already being actively examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my initial response to the Ombudsman's special report, any solution has to be on a general basis taking into account all the issues, including the amount of revenue involved. In this regard, the House might be interested to note that the Revenue Commissioners pay out billions of euro in tax rebates each year. Consequently, the Exchequer implications of a general interest scheme must also be weighed. It is appreciated that what the Ombudsman is arguing is that Revenue should provide for a scheme confined to cases where Revenue are found to be at fault or guilty of maladministration. However, given the wide range of circumstances in which this can arise, including those in which a settled interpretation of law is overturned, even a confined scheme could result in very significant costs to the Exchequer. The parameters of any statutory scheme, which may be considered to address the repayments issues, will need to be thoroughly and carefully examined. As with all legislative <Col N="154" /> changes, such a scheme, if introduced, would apply prospectively. I will consider the result of this examination in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>There are a number of control and monitoring procedures in place to assist me in the management of public expenditure. These include annual profiles of spending, monthly issues figures and monthly expenditure reports from Departments. In addition, this year I initiated a system of monthly expenditure management reports to Government. I have received full co-operation from Ministers and their Departments throughout the year in implementing these procedures.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of the year the Government has adopted the approach that any unavoidable pressure on spending would have to be funded by equivalent offsetting measures elsewhere. Ministers have agreed a variety of offsetting measures to ensure that spending would not exceed the 14.4% increase provided for in the 2002 Revised Estimates Volume. I am still aiming to ensure that spending overall comes in on or close to target this year.</P>

    <P>Serving officers of my Department are encouraged to study economics and other relevant disciplines by means of the refund of fees scheme, which includes repayment of university fees and the provision of paid study leave and examinin<Col N="155" /> ation leave. Some 27 officers in my Department are currently pursuing courses which have one or more modules focusing on economics.</P>
    <P>To meet the specific needs of the Department, the training unit has developed, in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration, a diploma course in economics. Thirty two officers have completed the course to date, and there are 11 officers currently participating in the programme. A further six officers of the Department are attending the Trinity College-Institute of Public Administration joint Masters in Economic Policy Studies programme.

      <P>While the number of applications received by the closing date for the special savings incentive scheme is not available, the number of accounts opened at 30 April 2002 was 1,170,208. The tentatively estimated average monthly contribution per investor on the basis of the best available data is approximately &euro;150.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. Using the existing data and assuming that these variations will broadly cancel each other out, it is estimated that the full year cost to the Exchequer would be in the region of &euro;525 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, anecdotal evidence is that significant numbers of account holders recently raised their <Col N="156" /> monthly contributions, and on that basis the budget tax forecasts prudently assumed a total annual cost of the order of &euro;600 million to 2005. As the cost depends on customer behaviour, about which no-one can be certain, I cannot give a definitive figure of future costs to the Exchequer but obviously the costings are kept under ongoing review and analysis.</P>

    <P>The objectives of the ERI are to analyse in a systematic manner what is being achieved by Exchequer spending and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made on <Col N="157" /> priorities within and between programmes. The expenditure reviews are not undertaken centrally by the Department of Finance but are carried out by individual Departments and offices. The process is overseen by a central steering committee &ndash; CSC &ndash; chaired by the Secretary General, Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>My Department carries out its own reviews under the ERI. The Department's expenditure review plan for 2002 includes three reviews of programmes in the Department's Vote. These programmes are a grant-in-aid to the Institute of Public Administration &ndash; IPA &ndash; the change management fund and the payments to the promoters of certain charitable lotteries. Work is under way on these reviews, which will be completed by April 2003 in accordance with the timeframe for the ERI &ndash; 2002-2004. A review of the PEACE programme is under consideration in the context of the mid-term evaluation to be carried out by the Special EU Programmes Body under the requirements of the EU Structural Fund regulations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that the NDP-CSF evaluation unit, an independent unit under the aegis of my Department, completed a number of evaluations of programmes under the national development plan in the past 12 months and has a number of further evaluations under way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of the Tobin tax has been considered in a number of for a including the informal ECOFIN meeting at Liege on the 22 September 2001. The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However it would be fair to say that most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal, and believed that it was not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax including: the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other (non-taxable) alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, at a formal ECOFIN meeting on 16 October 2000, it was agreed that the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that this study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. This study, Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation, was published on 14 February 2002. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that &ldquo;while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated&rdquo;. There have been no developments at EU level since in regard to the possible introduction of such a tax.</P>
      <P>I remain unconvinced of the feasibility of such a tax.</P>

      <P>In 2000 the Revised Estimates provided for net Voted current expenditure of &euro;16.665 billion. The outturn was &euro;16.79 billion, &euro;125 million or 0.75% above the projected figure.</P>
      <P>In 2001 the Revised Estimates provided for net voted current expenditure of &euro;20.268 billion. The outturn was &euro;20.436 billion, &euro;168 million or 0.83% above the projected figure.</P>

I still believe that spending overall will come in on or close to target this year.</P>
    <P>As shown above the variance in the figures in the years 2000 and 2001 was less than 1% in each case. The overruns were as a result of somewhat higher than projected spending in some Departments &ndash; including Health and Children, Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government &ndash; which were partly offset by lower than projected spending in other Departments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The future programme of decentralisation of Government offices and agencies will be developed in the context of the national spatial strategy. An Agreed Programme for Government confirms the commitment of this Government in that regard. In addition to the national spatial strategy, there are, of course, other important issues which will impact on the success of a new decentralisation programme. All of these issues form part of a deliberative process. This process, as Deputies will appreciate, must comprehend such things as the many representations I have <Col N="160" /> received on behalf of some 120 population centres, consultation with staff interests and departmental managements, and the over-riding need to ensure that the programme can be managed in a manner which does not adversely impact on the delivery of the essential public services concerned.</P>
    <P>Until such time as that deliberative process has been completed, the selection of specific locations and-or Government offices for inclusion in the decentralisation programme cannot occur. Deputies will, therefore, appreciate that I am unable to comment on individual proposals or advise which Government Departments may be considered for decentralisation. All I can say at this stage is that Deputies may be assured that the many submissions and representations regarding decentralisation which have been made will be taken into account as part of the deliberative process.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced changes in this area in last week's budget. Certain tax rules, which, until then, allowed individuals to avoid a capital gains tax charge by selling assets during a period of temporary residence abroad, were changed. In future, where an Irish domiciled individual ceases to be tax resident in the State for a tax year, then, subject to certain conditions, certain assets will be deemed, for capital gains tax purposes, to be disposed of and reacquired by that individual on the last day of the tax year immediately preceding the tax year when he or she ceased to be tax resident.</P>
      <P>This disposal and reacquisition will be deemed to occur where: the individual again becomes Irish tax resident before the end of a continuous period consisting of five complete tax years commencing with the year of cessation; and during his or her temporary non-residence, the individual disposes of the assets concerned, which disposal does not result in an Irish tax charge under other existing rules; and the assets concerned are all or part of a significant interest in a company, whether in Ireland or abroad.</P>
      <P>An individual will be regarded as having a significant interest in a company if he or she owns 5% or more by value of the share capital of the company, or owns an interest in the company, the value of which exceeds &euro;500,000.</P>
      <P>These changes take effect in respect of individuals who, on or after 4 December 2002, cease to be tax resident in the State.</P>

      <Col N="161" />I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they contacted the Portuguese authorities earlier this year proposing to commence negotiations for a protocol to the Ireland-Portugal double taxation convention which has been in force since 1995 to deal with capital gains tax issues. These negotiations have yet to take place. The need for a change to the convention will be reconsidered in the light of the change announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have recently initiated discussions with the Cayman Islands for the negotiation of a tax information exchange agreement. First round negotiations have not yet taken place although it is hoped to finalise a date for such negotiations shortly.</P>
      <P>TIEAs are based on the OECD model agreement on exchange of information in tax matters which was published in April 2002. The purpose of the model agreement is to promote international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information. The model agreement grew out of the OECD project on harmful tax practices, sets out minimum standards for effective exchange of information between OECD member countries and committed jurisdictions and provides a template for the negotiation of TIEAs. Committed jurisdictions are those jurisdictions that have committed to the principles of transparency and effective exchange of information in response to the OECD project on harmful tax practices. As part of these commitments, these jurisdictions have agreed to enter into a TIEA with any OECD country which requests such an agreement.</P>
      <P>Any TIEA based on the model agreement will require jurisdictions, on request, to exchange bank information as well as information regarding the beneficial ownership of companies, partnerships and trusts. Exchange of information will be required for information relevant to criminal tax matters from 1 January 2004 and from 1 January 2006 for civil tax matters.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are confident that discussions with the Cayman Islands will lead to the successful conclusion of a tax information exchange agreement although at this point in time it is not possible to predict when the agreement might be finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no general change in the basis of the tax system from domicile to residence. The income tax system is based on residence and there has been no change in the position. The capital gains tax system is largely based on residence with some domicile elements and this has been the case since its introduction. The question of domicile does not arise in the case of corporation tax.</P>
      <P>It is presumed therefore that the Deputy is referring to the changes made in the 2000 budget and the Finance Act, 2000, in relation to capital acquisitions tax. These changes related to the basis on which gift tax and inheritance tax are charged on assets situated outside the State. Prior to 1 December 1999 the charge depended on the domicile of the disponer at the relevant date. This general domicile rule was replaced by a residence rule whereby the charge to tax on the foreign assets now arises where either the disponer or the beneficiary is resident or ordinarily resident in the State at the relevant date. Irish assets continue as before to be liable to gift tax or inheritance tax, irrespective of the residence or domicile of the disponer or beneficiary. The Revenue Commissioners do not maintain statistics per se of the tax yield coming from gifted or inherited foreign assets.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in response to a similar question on Tuesday, 12 November &ndash; 21317/02 &ndash; the tax status of such payments depends on the circumstances of the payment. If the payment was in the nature of income, the payment would be subject to income tax. If the payment was a gift which falls within the definition of a taxable gift in capital tax law, tax under that heading would be payable.</P>
      <P>Whether or not a payment is considered to be corrupt, as such, is of little or no importance in tax law. Section 58 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides for taxation of profits or gains which arise from an unlawful or unknown source of activity. All the payments referred to in the Flood tribunal report are the subject of continuing tax inquiries in the investigation branch of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the public proceedings of the tribunal are carefully monitored by their investigation branch staff and where it appears that taxation issues arise, these issues are noted for enquiry. Depending on the results of these inquiries, the cases are noted for full investigation.</P>
      <P>A total of 62 cases related to the Flood tribunal are already under investigation and a further 41 cases are being prepared for investigation. A total of &euro;16.6 million has been paid on account by a number of the cases under investigation.</P>

The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names.

      <P>Revenue is making extensive use of its legislative powers to seek books, records, documents and information in the cases being investigated. Where appropriate, prosecutions will be considered but these will depend on the level of evidence available.</P>

      <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Act places a statutory requirement on the Minister for Finance to make a payment of 1% of GNP into the fund each year. I have no plans to introduce amending legislation to change this requirement.</P>
      <P>To leave discretion in the making of the 1% contribution would, I am convinced, undermine the whole basis of the fund. If discretion were left in the making of the payment of the 1% contribution, it is likely that future Governments would come under pressure to prioritise shorter term economic goals at the expense of making the payment. It is essential that the mandatory contribution be maintained. Once it is breached for one purpose, it is more likely that it will be breached again.</P>

      <P>The Government's Green Paper on Basic Income was published on foot of a commitment in the 1997 Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium. The Green Paper is based on work undertaken for the steering group on basic income in the period 1999 to 2000, arising from a commitment in Partnership 2000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness. The specific proposal studied would involve the replacement of the existing social welfare and income tax systems with a flat universal payment to all adults (with a smaller amount for each child), a new social solidarity fund to compensate people on low incomes who would lose out from the abolition of existing social welfare payments and a flat rate of approximately 48% tax on all income &ndash; i.e. no tax credits &ndash; other than on the basic income payment. The purpose of the Green Paper is to bring the issues involved to the attention of the wider community and to encourage debate. I welcome the publication of the Green Paper and I am confident that it will help to clarify the complex issues involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>The increases in public spending over the past two years have led to considerable improvements in public services, particularly in the key priority areas of health, education, social welfare and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>There are already a variety of measures in place to assess value for money, including reviews conducted by individual Departments under the expenditure review initiative, value-for-money audits undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General and national development plan evaluations. The relevant committees of this House also have the opportunity to examine issues relating to value for money in their scrutiny of Departmental estimates.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to establish a permanent commission to promote better value for money. However, I believe there is scope for securing better value for money through more effective control and management of public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already outlined to the House a number of improvements to the financial management systems which I will be introducing from the beginning of next year: in order to facilitate a <Col N="167" /> more informed assessment of emerging spending trends, I intend to publish the spending profiles which are submitted to my Department at the start of the year; I also intend to publish corresponding information from the Revenue Commissioners on tax profiles for 2003; Ministers and their management advisory committees will be required to manage strictly within the allocations given to them; I will continue to submit monthly expenditure management reports to Government reporting on overall spending and revenue trends; improvements will be made in risk assessment measures and in contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures which may emerge as the year progresses; spending on demand-led schemes will be managed effectively, as is required in all other spending programmes; revised arrangements will be introduced for managing capital spending which will provide details of capital projects being initiated during 2003 and planned for the following four years; and finally, the financial management system will provide incentives for Departments to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For example, savings generated during the course of the year as a result of specific policy measures taken by a Minister to curtail or eliminate a scheme-programme, or on foot of specific efficiency measures, should as a general rule be available for other high priority programmes within the same Department.</P>
    <P>While these control measures are very important in their own right they are also designed to encourage public service managers to seek out and exploit greater efficiencies. A number of initiatives are already in place which will help put the spotlight on value for money issues. The continuing development of the management information framework will put in place an important tool to enable departments more effectively to monitor and assess value for money aspects of their spending. The mid-term evaluation of the national development plan in 2003 will evaluate all spending under the plan. Proposals are also being developed by my Department to improve policy analysis and evaluation capacity across the civil service and my Department is currently reviewing its guidelines on the appraisal and management of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The public has a right to see whether it is getting value for money and I am confident that these measures will, over time, improve the evaluation of effectiveness of spending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The original estimate of &euro;1,381 million for Ireland's EU budget contribution in 2002, which was <Col N="168" /> included in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure published on 1 December 2001, was primarily based on the expected shape of the 2002 EU budget, which was adopted on 13 December 2001. Subsequently, two supplementary amending budgets adopted in the EU in 2002 resulted in substantial downwards revisions in the contributions expected of member states in 2002. These reductions in member state contributions were possible because of the carryover into the 2002 EU budget of an outturn surplus of &euro;15billion from the 2001 EU budget. This surplus from the 2001 EU budget arose from savings in the agricultural sector, fines paid in competition cases and the under-utilisation of allocations for the Structural Funds. The overall 2002 value to Ireland arising from the supplementary amending budgets is some &euro;281 million &ndash; involving a saving of &euro;259 million on our estimate for the contribution itself and a direct refund to the Exchequer of &euro;22 million. Savings on our estimated 2002 EU budget contribution were signalled in the press statement of 2 July last accompanying the end-June 2002 exchequer returns.</P>
      <P>The rest of the saving on Ireland's EU budget contribution, some &euro;71 million, essentially reflects the slowing rate of economic growth. GNP is the major element in determining member state contributions to the EU budget. If Ireland's GNP growth outstrips the forecasts underlying the EU budget, retrospective balancing payments must subsequently be made. In recent years, Ireland has had to make substantial retrospective payments in respect of unforeseen economic growth. In 1999 this balancing payment was as high as &euro;181 million and in 2001 it was &euro;135 million. The forecast for the 2002 EU budget made a prudent provision for a balancing payment but in the event our balancing payment in 2002 was only &euro;19 million. In effect, a further saving of about &euro;71 million is therefore available. This makes for a total saving of about &euro;330 million on our EU budget contribution estimate for 2002. I might add that the definitive figure for 2002 is not yet available because data in respect of our last payment is not yet finalised. However, our 2002 EU budget contribution should not be above &euro;1,051 million as indicated in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure published on 30 November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2003 EU budget process is nearing completion but the budget is not due to be formally adopted by the European Parliament until next week. A number of imponderables have to be taken account of in the forecast of Ireland's 2003 EU budget contribution. These include: the possibility that the European Parliament, which has the final say on more than half of the EU budget, could increase the allocations adopted by Council on its second reading; we do not yet know the budget outturn for 2002 and hence the surplus left over for carryover into 2003; the amount that will have to be repaid to the UK in 2003 under the 1984 Fontainebleau agreement is not yet finally known; we also do not know the exact amount of <Col N="169" /> Ireland's balancing payment due in 2003; and the demands that might be made on the EU budget in respect of such EU facilities as the recently established EU solidarity fund and other unforeseeable contingencies.</P>
    <P>From the above, the Deputy will see that factors impacting on the eventual outturn are only known definitively after &ndash; and in some cases some considerable time after &ndash; the original budget provision is decided upon. In some years savings arise and in some years excesses arise.</P>
    <P>The 2003 estimate for Ireland's EU budget contribution includes prudent provision in respect of these factors. It is not possible at this stage to state if savings will arise on the provision. The key variables in this regard are the surplus carryover into 2003 and the GNP balancing provision arising from the final definitive provisions for GNP growth. The extent of the surplus should be known sometime in the first half of next year while the Commission will only send out its demand for and calculation of the GNP balancing payment in late November next year.</P>

      <P>There currently is an annual exemption from capital gains tax of &euro;1,270. If an individual's chargeable gains in a tax year are no greater than this amount, that individual has no capital gains tax liability in respect of those gains. If the chargeable gains are greater than this amount, &euro;1,270 is deducted from the gains before calculating the liability. Any unused exemption cannot be carried forward into the next tax year.

      <P>The annual report and accounts of the Central Bank for the year ended 31 December 2001 was published in June of this year. The Central Bank made a profit of &euro;563 million in 2001. From this, it transferred surplus income of approximately &euro;531million to the Exchequer this year. This compares with an estimate of &euro;475 million included in the 2002 budget.</P>
      <P>Total projected Exchequer receipts from the Central Bank in 2002 are &euro;1,141 million. This comprises &euro;610 million in projected exceptional receipts on top of the &euro;531 million in surplus income. A sum of &euro;240 million of this total arises from the prospect that the value of old Irish denominated banknotes redeemed in exchange for new euro notes will fall short of the value of Irish notes outstanding. It is also anticipated that by year end some &euro;370 million will have been transferred to the Exchequer in respect of accrued surplus from the issue of coin, which previously accrued to the currency reserve of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The projected amount of surplus income for 2003, as provided by the Central Bank and published in budget 2003, is &euro;575 million. A projection of &euro;80 million is included in the budget in respect of receipts from the issue of coin.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. Using the existing data and assuming that these variations will broadly cancel each other out, it is estimated that the full year cost to the Exchequer would be in the region of &euro;525 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" />However, anecdotal evidence is that significant numbers of account holders recently raised their monthly contributions, and on that basis the budget tax forecasts prudently assumed a total annual cost of the order of &euro;600 million to 2005. As the cost depends on customer behaviour, about which no-one can be certain, I cannot give a definitive figure of future costs to the Exchequer but obviously the costings are kept under on-going review and analysis.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to provide every support which I consider appropriate to the Revenue Commissioners in carrying out their task of improving tax compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" />The Revenue Commissioners are currently well placed to do this, having at their disposal a large body of enhanced audit and investigative powers, much of which was provided during my term of office as Minister for Finance, as well as having considerable additional staffing resources &ndash; over 400 additional staff sanctioned over the last two years, for example. My aim is to build on this strong base already established and any further actions deemed necessary or desirable in this regard will be considered on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I should point out that under Revenue's current statement of strategy they are committing greater efforts and resources to improving returns filing and tax payment compliance. They are also increasing the resources that are devoted to Revenue's audit and compliance programmes. Revenue will continue to tackle the shadow economy by identifying and registering all customers with a tax liability and following up taxes due.</P>
    <P>In the audit area the Revenue Commissioners have undertaken a number of recent key strategic developments with an overall objective of delivering on their commitment to maximise compliance. These include: commissioning a computerised risk-based case selection system for revenue audit; revising the code for Revenue auditors to ensure that the level of penalties levied reflects the seriousness of the tax default; and the LINKS project, which is in the course of development, will link all computer records and all data held by Revenue so that a better overall view of a defaulting taxpayer can be established in order to help tailor compliance and audit action.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Revenue Commissioners are undergoing a process of restructuring with a view to increased efficiencies in managing the tax system. This restructuring will facilitate an even more focused response to tax compliance.</P>
    <P>Under this restructuring, Revenue set up recently a large cases division with specific focus on the largest cases and wealthiest individuals to ensure that they are tax compliant. A prosecutions division to deal with prosecutions of persons involved in serious tax evasion has also recently been established.</P>
    <P>There are other areas from which Revenue hope to divert resources to compliance operations. For example, the introduction and success of pay and file has reduced the number of contacts with Revenue. In particular, the expansion of the Revenue on line service &ndash; ROS &ndash; will allow for the release of resources to compliance operations.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners consider that the implementation of these efforts and initiatives should result, over time, in a continued improvement in compliance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's debt strategy for developing countries was launched in July 2002 by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. The Government has concluded that, in principle, the total cancellation of the debts of the heavily indebted poor countries is a politically acceptable objective and one that we would support. Total cancellation would, however, have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. In order to mobilise the necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their ODA more rapidly and take concrete steps to meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of the debt strategy, officials from Ireland Aid have had consultations in Washington with the Bretton Woods Institutions. In addition, officials from my own Department forwarded the debt strategy document to Ireland's representatives at the IMF and the World Bank in advance of the annual meetings of these institutions.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw Deputies attention to the Taoiseach's address to the World Summit on Sustainable Development where he articulated Ireland's policy in relation to cancellation of developing country debt at the highest political level. The Deputies can be assured that the international community has been made aware of Ireland's policy on developing country debt.</P>
      <P>My Department, in close coordination with Ireland Aid, will continue to promote our views on debt relief in all relevant international fora. We will also continue to monitor closely, developments in the HIPC initiative process and participate actively in all relevant international meetings.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to reiterate that I fully support efforts to combat global poverty and I will continue to press for the implementation of a HIPC initiative that delivers on its aim of exit from unsustainable debt, and to urge the international community to implement commitments to the ODA target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new gender equality policy for the Civil Service sets out the Government's commitment in this key area of human resource management. Under the policy, Departments are required to set strategic objectives and equality goals which will secure equality of opportunity for all employees. The equality objectives must be included in Departmental strategy statements.</P>
      <P>Equality of opportunity is central to the development and implementation by Departments of effective human resource management policies. Departments strategic equality objectives must be supported by a detailed programme of action in key human resource management areas such as recruitment, promotion and the implementation of flexible working arrangements, in order to address any obstacles which may hinder the achievement of equality.</P>
      <P>A particular focus of the new policy is to address the serious under representation of women at senior management levels. In order to tackle this imbalance, the Government set a target for the key assistant principal grade with the aim of increasing the number of women in the pool of potential candidates available for promotion to the more senior levels. Under the Government target, Departments must work to ensure that, by 2005, 33% of assistant principal posts are filled by women.</P>
      <P>As part of their strategic planning, Departments have now drawn up equality objectives and goals and are implementing them. I can report that progress is being made on the Government's target for women in AP posts: in June 2000, the percentage was 27%; figures from March 2002 show that women fill 30% of these posts.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the equality unit in the Department of Finance held a series of meetings with Departments and offices on the policy. The aim was to exchange ideas on how best to implement the policy, with particular emphasis on the need to tackle the imbalance at the higher management levels. Following further contacts with Departments and offices during the year, the Unit is finalising a report which summarises initiatives being taken by Departments and makes proposals about what more could be done. The report will be circulated to all Departments shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These discussions have shown that Departments are implementing the policy effectively and are addressing issues across a broad range of human resource management areas. I am confident that the policy will secure equality of oppor<Col N="177" /> tunity for both men and women in the Civil Service and will also address the imbalance at management.</P>

      <P>I am generally satisfied with the tax treatment of families. The tax code treats families more favourably than single persons.</P>
      <P>For example, in the case of income tax: with the exception of the PAYE credit, married couples may transfer their credits between spouses; married couples, who may or may not have children, and widowed and lone parents are entitled to higher standard rate bands than single persons; widowed parents with dependent children may receive the widowed parent tax credit in addition to a single personal tax credit and one-parent family tax credit; lone parents may receive the one-parent family tax credit in addition to the single tax credit in recognition of the expenses they may face in raising children single-handedly.</P>
      <P>Family members also receive favourable treatment in the capital acquisitions tax, stamp duties and capital gains tax codes. For example, there is no liability to any of these three taxes on transfers between spouses. There is a much higher threshold for capital acquisitions tax in the case of transfers from parents to children as compared to other transfers. There is also a special stamp duty concession for transfers between certain close relatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When discussing the Central Bank's reserves, it is important to specify the reserves in question. The official external reserves are principally composed of the foreign currency assets of the Central Bank. As of end October 2002, these stood at &euro;5.32 billion. The management of these foreign currency assets is subject to any guidelines issued by the ECB under Article 31(3) of the statute of the European system of central banks and of the European Central Bank to ensure that these operations will not interfere with the monetary and exchange rate policies of the euro area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Central Bank's balance sheet, the bank's total assets, including its external reserves, have a counterpart in liabilities. These liabilities include banknotes in circulation and credit institution and Government deposits. However, the bank does have accounting reserves which have been accumulated over the years from income earned by its operations. As of end October 2002, they <Col N="178" /> stood at &euro;1,317 million. The bank also has a revaluation account which reflects unrealised gains from valuation changes in its assets. This acts as a contingency provision against currency and other market fluctuations. As of 25 October 2002, the value of the revaluation account was &euro;878 million.</P>
    <P>The appropriate level of the bank's accounting reserves is a prudential matter for the Central Bank board. Of course, an event such as the changeover to the euro which has a large effect on the financial system gives rise to some consideration of the role and purpose of the accounting reserves. I, therefore, took the opportunity late last year to invite the board of the Central Bank to consider whether a portion of its accounting reserves might be made available to the State. In its reply, the board indicated that, when the changeover to the euro was completed, it would conduct a review of the level of accounting reserves. I will examine the results of this review when they become available.</P>
    <P>Current discussions in the European Central Bank could have implications for the level of national central bank reserves. The Central Bank of Ireland will take account of the outcome of these discussions in drawing up a view on the appropriate level of reserves in the Irish case.</P>

      <P>The annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank were held in Washington in September. The main business of the meetings was conducted by two committees of the boards of governors &ndash; the development committee and the international monetary and financial committee.</P>
      <P>At the annual meetings, Ministers welcomed the continued progress made on the HIPC initiative and reconfirmed commitment to its implementation and full financing. There was full support for the objective of helping the poorest, most heavily indebted members achieve an enduring exit from unsustainable debt while recognising that considerable challenges remain. Success will require a sustained commitment by HIPC countries to improvements in domestic policies and economic management as well as full participation and delivery of relief by international financial institutions and the donor community.</P>
      <P>Last April, Ministers endorsed a World Bank plan to help make primary education a reality for all children by 2015 and to achieve gender equality in primary and secondary education by 2005.

      <P>Recognising the special challenges faced by Africa in meeting the millennium development goals, Ministers urged the bank and the IMF to scale up assistance to these countries and to build on the NEPAD initiative as a unique opportunity to make significant and quick progress building on African leadership.</P>
      <P>Ministers reaffirmed the crucial importance of trade as a source of growth and poverty reduction.

      <P>Committee members reviewed further experience with poverty reduction strategy Papers &ndash; PRSPs &ndash; which confirmed the broad findings of the joint bank-fund review earlier this year and were encouraged by the increased momentum in countries' efforts to develop and implement their PRSPs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" />On the issue of the global economy, Ministers observed that recovery is proceeding, although at a slower pace than expected earlier this year. Growth is expected to strengthen in the near term, supported by a strong policy response across the international community. In the advanced economies, growth generally is expected to strengthen. However, monetary policy-makers should remain ready to respond to developments where necessary and to ease policy further if the risk of economic weakness intensifies and inflation prospects remain subdued.</P>
    <P>Committee members welcomed the managing director's report on the IMF in a process of change, which sets out the reforms under way to make the fund more effective in promoting greater financial stability and stronger global growth.</P>
    <P>Support was voiced for the fund's continuing role in helping poor countries address the challenge of meeting the millennium development goals by supporting economic reforms aimed at accelerating growth and reducing poverty.</P>
    <P>Committee members welcomed actions taken by many countries to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, in response to the action plan agreed in Ottawa last year, and urged countries that have not fully responded to do so urgently. An annual report on Ireland's participation in the Bretton Woods Institutions is published and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The latest inflation projection published by my Department was included with the budget documentation. It estimated that inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index or CPI, would average 4.7% in 2002. The latest available data, which refer to October, show an annual CPI inflation rate of 4.6%.</P>
      <P>In terms of EU comparisons, the appropriate measure is the EU harmonised index of consumer prices or HICP. On this basis, Irish inflation is also projected to average 4.7% in 2002. The latest EU Commission forecasts &ndash; autumn &ndash; project an inflation rate of 2.1% in the EU this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department closely monitors the level of inflation and its causes. Irish inflation is higher than the EU average for a number of reasons. These include strong services sector inflation, which is currently running at around 7%-8% compared to goods price inflation of about <Col N="181" /> 2.5%. This higher level of services sector inflation reflects high levels of wage increases and inadequate levels of competition in some areas.</P>
    <P>It is important that cost pressures are not allowed to lead to deteriorating competitiveness which would result in higher unemployment. This is why wage moderation, and cost moderation more generally, are so important.</P>

      <P>It is understood from the Revenue Commissioners that there is no provision that would allow specific sectors of the motor trade to preferentially pre-book specific individual or blocks of vehicle registration numbers. However, a facility does exist whereby any person, trade or otherwise, intending to purchase a vehicle may choose and reserve a particular registration number in advance of registration. The conditions and procedures for reservations are as follows: application for an &ldquo;03&rdquo; number may only be made on or after 1 November 2002; the fee for a reserved number is &euro;315; and the number chosen must be one in the normal format, and must correspond with the place where the applicant normally resides and the year of the first entry into use of the vehicle. All registration numbers are available for reservation, with the exception of the first number of each year issued in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford. These are traditionally reserved, on application, to the mayor-lord mayor of each of those cities; the vehicle must be registered to the person in whose name the number was reserved. Reserved numbers can not be sold or transferred; registration may not take place until such time as the number has been reached in the normal registration sequence; a reserved number may not be displayed on a vehicle until such time as it has been formally assigned by Revenue at the time of registration; the processing of applications for the following year commences on the 4th working day of November each year. Applications are dealt with on a first come first served basis. Where a number of applications are received for the same number, at the same time, the successful applicant is decided by lottery. Where a reservation is cancelled, the number becomes available for reservation again.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the principles underlying the strategic management initiative, my Department has been for some time pursuing an active policy of maximum delegation to Departments. In relation to large capital programmes therefore, responsibility for individual projects is generally delegated to the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework in relation to the management of capital investment. In managing capital projects, Departments are required to comply with my Department's guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These guidelines, which are currently under review by my Department, set out four main stages of project appraisal and management. The <Col N="184" /> appraisal stage aims to provide a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in principle. This stage includes an assessment of uncertainty and risk.</P>
    <P>The planning stage involves the establishment of a project management structure, preparation of a design brief, detailed planning and design of the project and a review of costings. If changes are proposed to the project in the course of the planning stage, the guidelines make it clear that the cost implications should be fully appraised and the approval of the sanctioning authority should be sought before proceeding. On receipt of a tender price and other relevant information, the case for proceeding with the proposal is again subject to review. Where it is proposed, following such re-appraisal, to go ahead with a project at a price higher than that originally proposed, a decision will again be required by the sanctioning authority to proceed.</P>
    <P>The implementation stage begins once the final approval for the award of a contract has been secured. If adverse developments occur, including unforeseen costs increases, which call into question the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency should consider necessary measures to rectify the situation. Where, despite these measures, increased costs are likely to arise, the approval of the sanctioning authority for the extra expenditure should be obtained before any commitment is made to accept cost increases. The viability of the project, given the changed circumstances, should also be reported.</P>
    <P>The final stage following the completion of a project, is post project review. Such a review is recommended to evaluate both the outturn and the effectiveness of appraisal and management procedures.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the steps outlined in the guidelines provide sufficient guidance to Departments and agencies for the re-evaluation of projects at key points in the decision making process and that accounting officers are fully aware of the need for ensuring value for money in the consideration of all capital projects.</P>

      <P>The reduction in the rate of excise duty on off-course betting from 5% to 2% from 1 May 2002 was specifically targeted at safeguarding the Irish betting industry by reducing the incentive for Irish bookmakers to move offshore, in particular to the UK. On 6 October last year, the UK authorities abolished betting tax and replaced it with a gross profits tax paid directly by bookmakers on their profits. This initiative, combined with an increase in telephone and internet betting, provided an increased opportunity and greater financial incentive for the migration of much of the indigenous betting market to the UK. Many Irish bookmakers indicated that they could no longer compete with the tax-free betting offered by the UK bookmakers and were being forced to move part or all on their service abroad, in order to compete with foreign bookmakers. The reduction in the rate of excise duty was a significant step towards preventing this. The revenue for 2002 from betting tax is estimated to be in line with that fore<Col N="186" /> cast for the year, which took account of the reduction in the rate announced in budget 2002. As is normal, I review all tax measures on a regular basis. As Deputies are aware no changes were made to this rate in budget 2003.</P>

      <P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended by the Finance Act, 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders will be the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that seventeen applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions that have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 23 financial institutions. One other application in relation to one other deposit taker is before the courts at the moment. Information that is being supplied by deposit takers under court orders is becoming available on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>Work commenced in February 2002 on the initial lists of over 1,800 account holders identified in the DIRT look-back audits. Very large volumes of information are being reported to Revenue under the High Court orders. Work in relation to the examination of the first batch of taxpayers identified under the High Court orders commenced on 11 October 2002.

    <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long programme of investigations over a number of years, the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are satisfied that significant progress is being made in this new phase of the investigations.

      <P>If maintenance payments are made under a legally enforceable maintenance arrangement, the spouse paying the maintenance must make the payments gross to the other spouse and is entitled to claim a tax deduction for such part of the maintenance payments that is for the benefit of the other spouse. The recipient of the maintenance is liable to tax on the maintenance payments received, and both spouses are taxed as single persons. For income tax purposes, the maintenance payments received in this way would be added to any other taxable income, for example, from part-time employment. Where the receiving spouse has the care of a dependant child &ndash; i.e. the child is resident with the parent for the whole or part of the tax year &ndash; he or she is entitled, in addition to the basic single credit of &euro;1,520 to a single parents credit of &euro;1,520. The combined value of these credits is equal to the married persons tax credit of &euro;3,040.</P>
      <P>Maintenance payments for the benefit of a child do not qualify for tax relief for the person making them and likewise they are not taxable in the hands of the recipient. However, where the couple are separated or divorced but have not remarried, there is provision, provided both parties are resident in the State, for them to jointly elect for the aggregation basis of taxation. In this event, the person paying maintenance will get no deduction for the maintenance payments nor will the recipient be taxable on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where maintenance payments are made informally and not under such a maintenance arrange<Col N="188" /> ment, the person making the payments cannot claim a tax deduction for those payments and the recipient is not taxable on them. However, where the payments are sufficient to maintain the recipient either wholly or mainly, then the payer will qualify for the married person's tax credit, but the standard rate band for a single person will apply. The recipient can also claim the single person's tax credit and single person's standard rate band against his-her own income &ndash; if any.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied generally with the present arrangements regarding the taxation of maintenance payments for married couples who have separated.</P>

If the full funding allocation given to a Department for a specific project is not used &ndash; for whatever reason &ndash; the Department concerned has some scope to reallocate that funding to other programmes within its area of expenditure.

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a similar question on 12 November, I intend to introduce a committee-stage amendment to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, which will impose an obligation on the bank to report to the Revenue Commissioners any information that leads the bank to suspect that a criminal offence of tax evasion may have been committed by a supervised financial institution. The bank will also be obliged to report to the Revenue Commissioners any failure by a financial institution to report suspected cases of moneylaundering of the proceeds of tax evasion.</P>
      <P>The Bill has already passed its Second Stage in this House and has been referred to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service. I hope that the committee will be in a position to debate the Bill in the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The public service benchmarking body was established as an independent body in July 2000 under the terms of the PPF to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The body reported in June 2002 and recommended varying level of pay increases for the grades examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed, as part of the adjustment to the PPF, that there would be discussions about the implementation of the report between public service employers and the public services committee of ICTU and also that one quarter of any increases recommended would be paid retrospectively from 1 December 2001. Talks on the implementation of the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body are currently under way in the context of negotiations on arrangements to follow the PPF. The cost of implementing the recommendations of the report is estimated to be &euro;1.1 billion in a full year. <Col N="191" /> Account will have to be taken of the impact this will have on the public finances.</P>
    <P>In my recent budget I provided for the payment in 2003 of the first phase of the increases arising from benchmarking. However, payment of the increases will be dependent on agreement, amongst other things, on the full implementation of the benchmarking body's report including the need for the delivery of real and verifiable changes. As I have indicated previously there is also a relationship between any new general round that might be agreed under a new programme and the benchmarking payments and this must be considered in the context of the budgetary pressures facing us.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in 1998 they obtained details of 430 cases with investments made under the Clerical Medical Insurance-NIB schemes. To date, 355 of these cases have been settled and 75 remain to be finalised. Of the cases not yet finalised, five are being investigated for possible prosecution through the courts and two cases are before the courts.</P>
      <P>To date, Revenue has collected &euro;42.35 million in tax, interest and penalties in respect of these cases. This is made up of &euro;35.76 million in settled cases and &euro;6.59 million in respect of payments on account in cases still under investigation.</P>
      <P>As part of a further review of its records by the financial institution concerned, a supplementary list containing 22 new cases was received by Revenue in April 2001. Of these, 15 cases involve relatively small sums and are unlikely to involve substantial tax evasion. All the additional cases are being investigated as appropriate.</P>

      <P>As I said in my budget statement last week, the Government has decided that numbers employed across all sectors of the public service are to be capped at their present authorised levels with immediate effect. In addition, the Government decided that there will be a reduction of 5,000 in the total number over the next three years.</P>
      <P>There are over 280,000 people employed in the public service according to the latest CSO figures and I consider that a reduction of 5,000 is realistic. I consider that an embargo on recruitment would be too crude a policy instrument. Instead there will be a selective approach to identifying areas across all sectors of the public service where savings in numbers can be made. I expect that the reduction can be achieved through natural wastage. There will not be a ban on recruitment as such but there will be a reduced level of recruitment and appointments.</P>
      <P>I have already started the process of consulting with my ministerial colleagues on where the reduction can be made. While I am not making any decisions on the distribution of the reduction until I have concluded the consultation process, I will be seeking to avoid or minimise the effect on front-line staff providing a service to the public and to ensure that essential services to the public will not be affected by the reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of making unused tax credits refundable has been considered by a working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare system. The group is made up of representatives of the social partners and is chaired by my Department. The group's report, setting out the results of its examination of this very complex area, will be finalised very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the current established approach to taxation in Ireland, and in other <Col N="193" /> OECD countries, is that while the tax system has a role to play in the broader issue of equitable income distribution, it is not the primary mechanism for the distribution of income to low-income households. Instead, the social welfare system is the main instrument for this. It is also the established and generally accepted view that the fundamental role of taxation is to raise revenue to fund the provision of services by the State. The introduction of a refundable tax credit system would be a major departure from this position. It would have significant implications for the social welfare system as well as wide-ranging economic, cost and administrative implications. I understand that the group's report will deal with the issues involved in considerable detail.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent progress report for the National Development Plan 2000-06, which was presented to the NDP-CSF monitoring committee on 29 November last, illustrates that the plan is generally achieving good financial progress. Cumulative expenditure under the national development plan to the end of June 2002, the latest figure available, is over &euro;15.4 billion. It is estimated that expenditure to the end of 2002 will total almost &euro;20 billion.</P>
      <P>NDP Exchequer investment in the key area of economic and social infrastructure &ndash; ESIOP &ndash; is well ahead of target. Taking account of the 2003 NDP capital provisions, including the budget day addition of &euro;209 million, it is estimated that by the end of 2003 ESIOP Exchequer investment will be &euro;12.2 billion almost &euro;1.9 billion more than profiled. I acknowledged in my budget statement that cost increases have impacted adversely on the output and timescale of the NDP infrastructure programme but nonetheless significant physical activity is in progress under the programme including some projects unprecendented in scale and size.</P>
      <P>As regards the rest of the NDP, the employment and human resources development operational programme is making good progress and cumulative expenditure is expected to be about &euro;6 billion by the end of this year. The productive sector and regional operational programmes are behind target levels due to the downturn in the global economy and factors such as delays in State aids approval from the EU and the impact of the foot and mouth crisis.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the mid-term review of the national development plan are now under way. The mid-term evaluation of each of the operational programmes will be commissioned shortly and they will be completed by the middle of next year. These will form the basis of the mid-term review of the plan as a whole, which will be completed towards the end of next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national pensions reserve fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. They control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, having regard to (<i>a</i>) the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000, and (<i>b</i>) the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20 of the Act, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.</P>
      <P>In determining the investment policy of the fund during the drafting of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, I gave consideration as to whether this policy should be strictly commercial or whether it should be qualified by ethical, environment and other public policy criteria.</P>
      <P>A major difficulty in deciding on an ethical investment policy is where to draw the line, given that there will inevitably be different opinions and intense debate on what constitutes ethical and socially responsible investments. In short, there is unlikely to be broad consensus on any ethical investment policy. Furthermore, the list of what might be considered unacceptable investments is likely to continually change in the light of developments in the political, social and scientific spheres.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the investment mandate included in the legislation is modelled on the standard commercial mandate for private pension funds &ndash; i.e. maximise returns subject to prudent risk management. However, I would point out that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act provides for the accountability of the commission to this House with regard to its investment strategy. The commission's annual report must be laid before each house of the Oireachtas and is required to include a detailed list of the fund's assets at year end. Furthermore, the chairperson of the commission is required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts at that committee's request.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date in meeting the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government to remove all those on the national minimum wage from the tax net; the number of persons who earn the national minimum wage or less who are currently paying income tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government programme identifies achieving a position where all those on the minimum wage are removed from the tax net as a priority over the next five years. The commitment is given in the context of a broader economic and budgetary strategy which provides, among other things, that the public finances will be kept in a healthy condition and that personal and business taxes will be kept down in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware also of the commitment contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which states: &ldquo;It is an agreed policy objective that, over time, all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The position is that the statutory minimum wage is an average hourly rate of gross pay for an employee as defined under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000. The wage currently stands at &euro;6.35 per hour having been increased from the previous amount of &euro;5.97 per hour which applied up to 30 September 2002. The annualised equivalent of the present minimum wage is &euro;12,878.</P>
      <P>The question of when all those earning up to an annual amount equivalent to the statutory minimum wage annualised will be not be liable for income tax is a matter for consideration by the Government over the next number of years consistent with the Governments overall economic and budgetary strategy and with the Governments commitments as already outlined. However, I can tell the Deputy that when the statutory minimum wage came into effect in 2000, less than 64% of the annualised figure of &euro;11,330 &ndash; £8,923 &ndash; was exempt from taxation. In budget 2002, 90% of the minimum wage became exempt from tax and in budget 2003 this position has been maintained even though the minimum wage was increased in October 2002.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that it is estimated that in 2003 there will be 52,000 tax cases who have income at or below the minimum wage and who are liable for income tax. It should be noted that this figure relates to those whose annual income is less than the minimum wage annualised and would include those who are working less than full-time on an hourly rate that is greater than the minimum wage. It should be noted that the figure differs from the earlier estimated figure of 72,000 supplied in my answer to a previous Dáil question on 12 November 2002 due to two factors &ndash; the increase in the threshold at or below which no tax is payable in budget 2003, and the fact that the estimate is on a post-budget 2003 basis as compared to the previous estimate which was prepared on a post-budget 2002 basis.</P>

      <P>GNP differs from GDP to the extent that factor income flows &ndash; which primarily comprise investment income outflows that remunerate foreign direct investment into a country &ndash; and investment income inflows &ndash; that remunerate a country's overseas investment &ndash; are not in balance. The growing gap between Ireland's GDP and GNP reflects Ireland's success in attracting mobile international investment and the success of companies locating here. That success, as well as creating extra jobs and income in Ireland, has increased net outward flows of investment income, widening the gap between Irish GDP and GNP.</P>

      <P>Ireland supports the retention of national sovereignty in tax matters and has long cherished its view that it is appropriate for fiscal matters in the European Union to be decided on a unanimous basis. A case has not been made that the introduction of the euro makes such harmonisation either necessary or desirable nor that the current position adversely affects the operation of the internal market. Tax harmonisation would ignore the varying needs and motivations of the member states' differing economic, social and cultural backgrounds.</P>
      <P>In relation to the area of corporate taxation, Ireland has a transparent corporate tax regime that encourages investment by having a competitive rate. In an EU context, to the extent that differences in corporate tax treatment cause barriers to trade and investment, we are quite prepared to work to remove these. I am of the opinion that making progress on those types of issues does not require full harmonisation of systems and rates. Therefore, I do not support any procedure that would lead to the introduction of a harmonised rate of corporation tax across the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach to indirect taxation mirrors the view I take on business taxation. Indirect taxation issues should be determined on the basis of unanimous agreement among the EU member states. Indirect taxes, and in particular value added tax &ndash; VAT &ndash; are subject to regimes which have a substantial basis in European law, but the basis for which has been determined by unanimous agreement among the member States. This approach facilitates tackling common issues <Col N="199" /> and removing barriers to business operating throughout the European Union, while still respecting the importance of national sovereignty in fiscal matters.</P>

      <Quest>his proposals to ensure that the new financial regulatory authority, IFSRA, will regulate the credit unions in a way which recognises them as a not for profit organisation; if it is his intention that they should be regulated in the same manner as other lending institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25669/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The McDowell group recommended that the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, in relation to credit unions, should be brought into the single regulatory authority &ndash; SRA &ndash; proposed by the group and that a statutory position of registrar of credit unions should be established within the SRA. Finally, the group recommended that the supervision of the credit unions by the SRA should be done in a way that would recognise and be supportive of the uniqueness of credit unions and would give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of the SRA while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, credit unions have not been regulated in the same way as banks. They have been regulated under separate legislation, viz. the Credit Union Act, 1997. The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, provides that this will continue to be the case. The functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Credit Union Act will be carried out by a registrar of credit unions within the overall framework of the regulatory authority, but the basis of that regulation will continue to be the Credit Union Act, 1997. I have no intentions of changing this basic position. There is nothing in the Bill which requires credit unions to be treated like commercial financial institutions, such as banks.</P>
      <P>However, I have signalled my intention to propose amendments on Committee Stage of the Bill, which would alter the reporting relationship of the registrar of credit unions, to bring the position more fully within the framework of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The reporting relationship of the registrar would be similar to that proposed for the consumer director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" />I understand that the new chief executivedesignate and the acting secretary to the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, have written recently to the Irish League of Credit Unions in relation to the manner in which they intend that credit unions should be regulated.</P>
    <P>The members of the interim IFSRA recognise and understand the important role that the credit union movement plays in this country. They recognise both the size and reach of the movement, its not-for-profit and voluntary nature and its broad support amongst the communities, which it serves. They recognise that credit unions have different functions and objectives to commercial financial institutions, such as banks and building societies, and that the regulation of the credit union movement must be appropriate to those functions and objectives. They highlight that, for this reason, the Government, in making clear their acceptance of all these principles, are proposing a separate statutory post of registrar of credit unions who will work under the requirements and protections of the Credit Union Act. IFSRA wants to work positively with the ILCU. In this regard, they have stated that they are open to discussing the valuable role that the ILCUs field officers play in assisting league members. IFSRAs only concern with the legislation as currently drafted is the accountability of the registrar of credit unions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to stress that the supervision of credit unions by the new regulatory authority should not be viewed as a threat to the movement, but rather as a development that will work to the advantage of the credit union movement and member-customers of credit unions.</P>
    <P>My concern as Minister for Finance is that credit unions should be properly regulated, consistent with their role and nature, and within a proper framework. The amendments I am proposing impact on the accountability of the position of registrar of credit unions, not on the powers of the registrar-IFSRA in relation to the regulation of credit unions, which remain the same. It would be remiss of me not to have looked again at this issue if, as was the case, the body of people who it is proposed will regulate the financial sector had expressed concerns about the structure within which the regulation will take place.</P>
    <P>I should say that the autonomous position of the registrar also required to be re-examined in the context of views received from the European Central Bank. I am required by the treaty to consult the ECB on certain financial legislation. The amendments I am proposing will address the issues raised by the ECB.</P>

      <P>The flat-rate scheme is a practical method of applying value-added tax to farming. It seeks to compensate unregistered farmers, on an overall basis, for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services i.e. farming inputs.</P>
      <P>The flat rate is reviewed annually in accordance with EU law by reference to macro economic data, for the preceding three years, on agricultural production and agricultural inputs and the deductible VAT content of such inputs, and was reviewed in advance of budget 2003.

      <P>The live register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of <Col N="202" /> people claiming unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and other claimants registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Figures are published for each county and each local social welfare office. The most recent information available is for November 2002. It should be noted that, (a) the live register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment assistance or benefit. Statistics on unemployment are measured at regional level by the quarterly national household survey; (b) the areas served by local employment offices do not correspond to specific geographic boundaries. Therefore, registrants at a given local office do not necessarily come from a particular region or area which can be precisely delineated. For instance, in the Tallaght local office &ndash; in County Dublin &ndash; there may be registered persons from the Blessington area &ndash; in Co Wicklow.</P>

      <P>I formally launched the talks on a successor agreement to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in Dublin Castle on 31 October, 2002.</P>
      <P>I invited organisations to participate in the negotiations on a new agreement on the principle that the Government will be entering talks on the basis of our own programme for Government. As Deputy Durkan will be aware, I also made it clear that those organisations invited to participate in the talks do so on the basis that social partnership brings rights and responsibilities, that these are exercised in a spirit of mutual respect and respect for the primacy of the democratic process and that what is agreed must reflect the objective needs of the whole community and the necessary accountability for public policy and public funds.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council published the summary of the recommendations of its strategy report on 19 November &ndash; copies of which have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report sets out an agreed approach to: the economic and social contexts in which the negotiations on a PPF successor should be set; the main challenges to be faced in the period ahead; and the options or paths to be followed in tackling those challenges.</P>
      <P>In summary then, the NESC strategy report, along with the Government's programme, and my statement on the basis on which the social partners were invited into talks, are acting as the guiding principles for the negotiations on a social partnership agreement to succeed the PPF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from the formal launch of the talks, a series of bilateral meetings are now well under way and, as with previous agreements, the <Col N="203" /> proceedings are subject to the normal confidentiality arrangements in order to protect the negotiating positions of all.</P>

      <P>The Pyramid Selling Act, 1980, makes it an offence to induce anyone to become a participant in a pyramid selling scheme. The Act is enforced by the Garda bureau of fraud investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be referring to so-called &ldquo;gifting schemes&rdquo; which are not covered by the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980. I am satisfied that pyramid selling legislation is not an appropriate model for dealing with that issue, nor would it be effective. Gifting schemes are in effect a form of gambling although the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is of the view that they do not come <Col N="204" /> within the definitions contained in gambling legislation.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I believe that the best remedy is common sense. It is clear that some participants in such schemes inevitably lose their money. People are entitled to use their money as they please but given the publicity that has attached to this issue, they cannot be in any doubt about the risk they are taking if they participate in these schemes. If a scheme sounds too good to be true it is probably just that &ndash; too good to be true.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment (CE), participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is very much aware of the important contribution that CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years, and the difficulties which now arise for sponsor organisations due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. In this context a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider <Col N="205" /> options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which will include an assessment of the role of the programmes in regard to the provision of community services. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of community services and appropriate levels of CE for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my previous reply referred to by the Deputy, the Irish Music Rights Organisation is a private, <Col N="206" /> not-for-profit company, one of whose activities is to administer the public performing right of songwriters, composers and music arrangers in Ireland. The Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, confers on such authors the exclusive right to carry out themselves, or to authorise or prohibit others to carry out certain acts in relation to their works, including their performance, showing and playing in public and their inclusion in broadcasts. Because of the impracticality from an author's viewpoint of administering public playing rights on an individual basis, such rights are normally administered through licensing bodies such as IMRO on behalf of their author-members, a situation recognised by the provisions of Part II, Chapter 16 of the Act. Collective management of this nature normally involves the collection of public playing royalties in accordance with licensing schemes, or tariffs, by a licensing body on behalf of its members.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise again that where a body of music is handed down directly in the folk tradition &ndash; that is to say, where it has no identifiable writer, composer or arranger, and where it may reasonably be assumed that any individuals of this nature have been dead for 70 years or more, the law supports no exclusive right of the sort outlined above in favour of any party; nor, I understand, does IMRO claim any such right. However, where a new song or other music is written by a modern author in a traditional form or idiom, or where traditional music outside copyright is the subject of a new arrangement, the new author or arranger will be entitled to copyright protection for their new creations as they would for any other new composition or arrangement. As with other new compositions and arrangements, the composer or arranger in such cases has the option of administering their public playing right as members of a body such as IMRO, and it would in practice be usual for them to do so.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to comment in particular on the individual dealings between IMRO and other parties such as Comhaltas Ceoltoirí Éireann. In general, however, I might comment that in instances where fully traditional music on the one hand and modern-arranged traditional music or modern music in the traditional idiom are performed in the same context, public performing rights administered by IMRO could be involved in respect of the latter arrangements and compositions.</P>

      <Quest>when the files held by the bureau of military history relating to the Tan War, 1919-1921, and the Civil War, 1922-1923, which were originally covered by the 50 year rule, will be released for the public to view.</Quest>

      <P>The term &ldquo;bureau of military history&rdquo; is used to describe a collection of original documents from the period commencing with the formation of the Irish Volunteers in November 1913 and ending with the termination of hostilities at the close of the War of Independence in July 1921. This unique body of documentary material is currently housed within the national military archives at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, as part of the wider National Archives. The bureau material comprises witness statements, press cuttings, voice recordings, photographs and other collections of documents.</P>
      <P>The bureau was established in January 1947 with the task of assembling documentary material for the compilation of the history of the War of Independence. The bureau ceased to be active in March 1959 and the body of material by then accumulated was stored in the Department of the Taoiseach in Merrion Street. The material was moved from Merrion Street to its present location in Cathal Brugha Barracks in 1999.</P>
      <P>In 1947, it was decided by the then Taoiseach and by the Minister for Defence that the archival material collected by the bureau of military history should not be released at all during the lifetime of those persons who had participated in the events covered by the bureaus archive. However, in 1987 the Government did decide that the Minister for Defence should have discretion to release copies of material entrusted to the bureau on application by the immediate relatives of the original donor. There has been a steady level of application from relatives for copies of such material over recent years.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the National Archives authorities advised that they were of the opinion that the time had come for the selective release of bureau materials, particularly in the light of continuing and significant levels of interest amongst professional academics in the possibility of their gaining access to the bureau material in the course of research work. Accordingly, in March 1999, the Government approved the selective release of material held by the bureau. Since 1999 an enormous effort has been put into preparing the materials for wider release and it is hoped that arrangements can be finalised in 2003 for their release. The 50 year rule does not apply to the bureau of military history collection.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on nine cows and two heifers under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk suppliers on 23 April 2001. His milk quota for the year in question was 18,710 gallons. The terms and conditions of the scheme provide that an applicant must have sufficient cows surplus to the cows needed to produce his quota and also provides that the number of notional dairy cows needed to produce the milk quota is that quota divided by 876 gallons. As the person named declared on his application that he held a total of 20 dairy and suckler cows it was therefore determined that he had insufficient cows to produce his milk quota and he was therefore not eligible for payment under the suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The agricultural adviser of the person named wrote to my Department on 14 January 2002 explaining that the person named had sold cull cows in January 2001 with the intention of replacing them with fresh dairy cows in early April 2001 but was prevented from doing so due to foot and mouth disease controls. He requested that my Department take into account the actual number of gallons of milk produced by the person named rather than the milk quota held by him for the purpose of calculating the number of notional dairy cows and that this would enable the person named to qualify for payment under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
      <P>As the EU regulations currently apply, it is not possible to determine notional dairy cows based on the number of gallons of milk produced. However, my Department has written to the European Commission for an interpretation of these regulations with regard to a similar case and we are awaiting a reply on the matter. In the event that the decision by the European Commission is favourable my Department will re-examine the application submitted by the person named.</P>

      <P>Following important amendments made to the EU regulations under Agenda 2000, I introduced significant changes in the management of milk quotas in Ireland with effect from April 2000. The main changes were the prohibiting of land and quota leases, except within a family, and the restriction of the temporary leasing of quota to three years. Under the new regime the main mechanism for the transferring of quota in Ireland is the milk quota restructuring scheme. During the past three years, 450 million litres &ndash; 105 million gallons &ndash; of milk quota has been restructured under restructuring schemes. This is more than the total quantity restructured during the previous decade. Almost 88% of the restructured quota has been allocated to smaller and medium scale producers.</P>
      <P>I also decided that the additional quota granted to Ireland under Agenda 2000 would be focused on small and medium sized producers who had demonstrated their commitment to milk production. Some 68 million litres &ndash; 15 million gallons &ndash; was allocated to 21,000 committed dairy producers with a quota of less than 55,000 gallons. Almost 45 million litres &ndash; 10 million gallons &ndash; was allocated to 3,500 committed younger dairy farmers with a quota of less than 35,000 gallons. The remaining 32 million litres &ndash; 7 million gallons &ndash; was allocated this month to smaller and medium scale producers who had low initial quota due to particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>Future restructuring schemes will continue to direct quota towards active committed producers with priority for those in the smaller and medium size categories.</P>

      <P>The person named is, in fact, a participant in the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming, having entered that scheme in May 1996. It was necessary to suspend the pension earlier this year because a difficulty had arisen in relation to the transferee's undertakings.</P>
      <P>It was a requirement of the 1994 early retirement scheme that the young person taking over the holding must acquire additional land and farm the enlarged holding for the period for which the pension is granted. The transferee in this case had leased the additional land. In March 2002 the lease was terminated, and my Department informed the person named that the transferee must find other land so that payment of the pension could continue. It was necessary to suspend payment of the pension from 30 August 2002 as my Department had been given no evidence that the transferee had found replacement land. On 12 November, however, the legal representative of the person named informed my Department that replacement land had been acquired. The position is currently being clarified between officials of my Department and the legal representative and a decision on the future payment of the pension will be made as soon as the precise circumstances have been established.</P>

      <P>The animal-based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. This scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking <Col N="217" /> density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and/or sheep may continue to qualify for payment provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department has now written to the person named with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to 2002 area-based compensatory allowance will be made on receipt of reply.</P>

      <P>A combination of factors, including in particular its increasing profile as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy &ndash; TSE &ndash; in the same family of disease as BSE, has led to a more pro-active approach to the eradication of scrapie from the national flock. It is, however, important to say at the outset that there is as yet no scientific evidence to connect scrapie with any human health disorder.</P>
      <P>In this regard, taking into account the interests of the Irish sheep sector, possible outcomes to ongoing scientific research and on the basis of veterinary advice, it was decided to de-populate all flocks which had a case of scrapie since 1 January 1999. The flockowners concerned are not permitted to re-stock with sheep for a period of two years from the date of depopulation. My Department has, by agreement with IFA, put in place a package which provides appropriate compensation for those affected. This package was adjusted to reflect market realities, again by agreement with IFA, in September 2002.</P>
      <P>The consequences for farmers whose sheep flocks are affected by scrapie are serious. In each case my Department conducts an epidemiological investigation to determine the possible source of the disease and the flocks at risk from infectivity. Decisions on the restriction and depopulation of flocks are taken on the basis of expert veterinary advice which, within general policy parameters, takes account of any mitigating veterinary circumstances in each case.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations with the EU Commission on Supplementary Measure A of the REPS commenced in 1997 and culminated in the approval by the Commission of the measure in August, <Col N="219" /> 1998 opening the way for payment of up to &euro;242 per hectare on commonage land and designated natural heritage areas, special areas of conservation and special protection areas.</P>
      <P>The agreement was negotiated by officials of my Department in difficult circumstances and in that context I believe that the outcome was highly satisfactory. There were significant environmental problems caused by overgrazing of sheep. These were particularly acute on commonages in the west. Two existing supplementary measures in REPS were not having an effect, take-up was low, and where one farmer on a commonage joined REPS his or her efforts to improve the environment were likely to be negated by other farmers using the same land. The situation had deteriorated to the point where, in 1998, the EU Commission withdrew approval for payment on any commonage land declared in new REPS applications and intimated that it was contemplating compulsory measures with no compensation for farmers.</P>
      <P>The agreement, which has enabled me to pay some &euro;7 million a year to farmers with commonage on top of their basic REPS payments, was secured during my tenure of office as Minister. During the same period, Deputy Noel Davern and Deputy Ned O'Keeffe were Ministers of State at my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the paper from the team referred to, indicating that certain skeletal muscles of mice experimentally infected with scrapie may contain infectivity and may reproduce prions, the EU's scientific steering committee has concluded that the parameters of the research do not justify its <Col N="220" /> extrapolation into BSE in cattle, and that there is no reason to revise its opinions with regard to the safety of bovine and sheep muscles.</P>
    <P>In addition, the results of other experiments in relation to possible infectivity in the muscle tissues of cattle and sheep, including work reported by the French Food Safety Authority on 27 March 2002, have been consistently negative.</P>
    <P>Consumers and others can be assured that a comprehensive range of measures remains in place in Ireland for the control and eradication of BSE. If any adjustments are deemed necessary in the light of operational experience, or in the light of new scientific work carried, they will be made. It is not considered, however, that the work referred to at this point warrants any changes to the comprehensive control system already operating in Ireland.</P>

      <P>A request for a record made under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 &ndash; FOI &ndash; must meet the requirements laid down in section 7(1) of the Act in order to be considered valid. First, the request must be made in writing to the public body that holds the record &ndash; a public body for the purposes of the FOI Act is a body listed in the first schedule of the Act. Second, it must be specified that the request is being made under the FOI Act. Finally, the request must contain sufficient particulars to enable the record to be found by taking reasonable steps.</P>
      <P>Similar requirements apply where an application under section 18 of the Act is made to a public body for a statement of reasons for decisions affecting the person or under section 17 where the application is for personal information to be corrected where it is incomplete, incorrect or misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A refusal of a request or application described &ndash; which would include a failure to reply to the request-application within the period laid down <Col N="222" /> in the Act &ndash; is not an offence: there are grounds in the Act which entitle and in some cases require a public body to refuse a request for a record. These are known as the Act's exemption provisions and must be considered in relation to each request. Rather, a person whose request is refused generally has the option of applying to the public body concerned for an &ldquo;internal review&rdquo; of the decision i.e. a review by a more senior official. A further refusal or failure to reply following an internal review entitles the person to apply to the Information Commissioner for an independent review. A decision of the Information Commissioner is binding on the parties concerned and can only be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>The Information Commissioner is independent in the exercise of his functions and has wide powers to obtain information relevant to a review carried out by his office. Section 37 of the Act sets out the powers of the Information Commissioner. Section 37(7) provides that: &ldquo;a person who fails or refuses to comply with a requirement (under section 37) or who hinders or obstructs the commissioner in the performance of his or her functions . . . shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,905 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both&rdquo;. A possible offence under section 37(7) would be a matter for the Information Commissioner in the first instance and ultimately for the courts to decide.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>The stamp duty levy on insurance premiums was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue. The yield from the 2% levy, as part of taxation receipts generally, contributes towards funding the general requirements of the Exchequer, and it is estimated that it will raise &euro;87 million in 2002. I understand insurance companies pay this levy <i>en bloc</i> to the Revenue Commissioners and that therefore there is no breakdown of the total yield attributable to each chargeable category, such as property insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>I am generally opposed to hypothecation, i.e. the earmarking of certain tax revenues for certain expenditures. It removes flexibility in public expenditure decision-making, which should be on the basis of the most cost effective outcomes, and ties Government's hands in deciding priorities as part of the budgetary process. Another weakness in the effectiveness of hypothecation as a means of allocating expenditure is that, while the required expenditure may match the likely income from a tax in a given year, this is unlikely to remain the case in the long-term, and both figures may diverge.</P>
      <P>If there is a case to be made for increasing expenditure in an area in a given year, such an increase should not be dependent on the success of a specific tax in raising the necessary funds. In addition, in the current budgetary context it should be remembered that if directed to new expenditure there would be a net deterioration in the Exchequer finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general matter of a new agency with responsibility for dealing with flood damage, the <Col N="226" /> Office of Public Works in consultation with the appropriate State authorities and other interested parties, is undertaking a review of policy on all aspects of flooding, flood relief and humanitarian aid. The results of these deliberations will be known in due course and I do not wish to say anything at this point to prejudice these deliberations.</P>

      <P>Discussions on a proposed energy taxation directive have been taking place intensively and frequently at Council working group and ECOFIN level with a view to reaching potential agreement on a text by year's end and further discussions are planned. As negotiations are at a critical stage it would not be appropriate to set out my views in detail at this juncture but I shall be taking into account all relevant national, economic, social and environmental factors in making a decision on any final proposed agreement.</P>
      <P>In essence, the proposed new energy tax directive is concerned with revising existing minimum excise rates for mineral oils, i.e. petrol, diesel, kerosene, LPG, and heavy fuel oil, last set in 1992 while extending these minimum rates to cover natural gas, coal and electricity. The current proposal represents a significant easing of the provisions when compared to the original 1997 Commission proposal or proposals on the table at the end of last year. While the date envisaged for implementation of the energy taxation directive is 2004, member states, including Ireland, are being offered varying transitional implementation periods. These transitional periods are under discussion as are a series of accompanying derogations that may be applied in certain instances at the discretion of member states.</P>
      <P>In arriving at this point, all member states have had to make compromises. Ireland's position has been to try to achieve maximum flexibility in the application of the proposed directive while bearing in mind our long-standing concerns on industrial competitiveness, inflation and impact on the less well-off, as well as Ireland's commitment to the implementation of the Kyoto Accord within the national climate change strategy.</P>

The proposed development provides for the removal of two existing staff huts to be replaced with a new single storey detached pavilion consisting of a security office, guide office, accessible toilet and storage area, a new approach pathway, new parking layout for 30 cars and a bicycle stand, two security poles seven metres high with security cameras attached, new landscaping layout, new fencing layout and all ancillary works.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the McDowell group recommended that the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, in relation to credit unions, should be brought into the single regulatory authority proposed by the group and that a statutory position of registrar of credit unions should be established within the SRA. The group also recommended that the supervision of the credit unions by the SRA should be done in a way that would recognise and be supportive of:</P>
      <P>The uniqueness of credit unions and would give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of the SRA while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 2000 my officials informed me that the legislative committee of the ILCU had asked if we would open consultations with them con<Col N="230" /> cerning how we would envisage credit unions being regulated within a single regulatory authority. My officials indicated to me that they intended to respond to the request by outlining to the ILCU how we would envisage the McDowell proposal for a statutory registrar of credit unions might operate. I was happy for my officials to talk to the league on this basis and there were three meetings between then and May 2001.</P>
    <P>In the course of those meetings my officials outlined proposals on how the registrar would be dealt with in the proposed legislation. No agreement was drawn up with the league regarding the provisions to be included in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002. I accept that the league had an expectation as to the provisions that would be in the Bill, based on these meetings. The Bill as published reflected what it was told.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendments I intend to propose on Committee Stage, credit unions have been regulated under separate legislation from the financial institutions, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Credit Union Act, 1997. The Bill provides that this will continue to be the case. The functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Credit Union Act will be carried out by a registrar of credit unions within the overall framework of the regulatory authority but the basis of that regulation will continue to be the Credit Union Act, 1997. I have no intention of changing this basic position.</P>
    <P>Both the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which I established in April to manage the transition to the new regulatory arrangements, and the Governor of the Central Bank, expressed reservations regarding the reporting arrangements for the registrar of credit unions within the proposed regulatory authority. Separately, the European Central Bank had expressed reservations about the autonomous position of the registrar within the overall structure. In the context of these concerns I felt obliged to look again at the provisions in relation to the registrar.</P>
    <P>I have signalled my intention to propose amendments on Committee Stage of the Bill, which would alter the reporting relationship of the registrar of credit unions, to bring the position more fully within the framework of the IFSRA. The reporting relationship of the registrar would be similar to that proposed for the consumer director.</P>
    <P>The changes I am proposing allow for the credit unions continuing to be regulated separately and distinctly under the Credit Union Act, 1997. Correspondence between the interim IFSRA and the ILCU has confirmed that this is the case.</P>
    <P>I would also take issue with the implication of the question that as the Bill stands the registrar is already answerable to the IFSRA board, certainly as far as the bulk of regulatory functions are concerned. As the Bill is published, the registrar is not subject to the control or direction of the regulatory authority in carrying out or <Col N="231" /> exercising the registrar's responsibilities or powers with respect to the registration of credit unions or the supervision of their affairs or activities and the proposed amendments are designed to correct this.</P>

      <P>The issues involved in integrating the tax and social welfare systems were examined in detail by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems in 1996.</P>
      <P>Since 1996 a considerable amount of progress has been made on foot of this report including the phasing out of the general income tax exemption limits and reform of the levy system. The exemption limit/marginal relief system was identified by the group as a contributory factor in unemployment and poverty traps. Government policy since budget 1998, the last time the general exemption limits were increased, has been to increase the tax credits to such a level that no-one need avail of the general exemption limits and, therefore, that no low income earner would face a marginal tax rate of 40%. This target may be regarded as having been achieved.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs is represented on the tax strategy group. This results in a more co-ordinated approach to the discussion of possible changes or reforms to tax or levy systems. The interaction between the tax and social welfare systems has been taken into account in the formulation of tax and social welfare packages in recent budgets and this approach will continue.</P>
      <P>As noted by the expert group at the time, the term integration of tax and social welfare can mean different things to different people, ranging from a total merging of the two systems to better co-ordination of the existing systems. If the Deputy would like to specify if he has specific integration issues in mind I would be glad to endeavour to respond. </P>

      <P>I met the IIF on 6 December to listen to their views, concerns and proposals in relation to the problem of flooding in Ireland. It was a very constructive meeting. The IIF welcomed my decision, announced on 27 November, to set up a review group to carry out a major review of national flooding policy. I am initiating this review to develop a cohesive national flooding policy.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the review is to assess the extent of the problem countrywide, clarify roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved and to recommend practical action to deal with flooding. The review will be carried out by a group representing the major stakeholders &ndash; the Office of Public Works, Departments of Finance and Environment and Local Government, local authorities, IBEC, and the IFA. The review group will receive submissions from, and consult with, a further wide range of relevant bodies. I have invited the IIF to make a submission to the review group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The McDowell group, when examining the range of financial service providers to be overseen by a <Col N="233" /> single regulatory authority, agreed that all financial providers should, in principle, be dealt with by a SRA and that a compelling case would have to be made for the exclusion of any provider from its remit.</P>
      <P>The group recommended that the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies in relation to credit unions be brought into the SRA. Its report stated that supervision of the credit unions by the SRA should be done in a way that would recognise and be supportive of:</P>
      <P>The uniqueness of credit unions and would give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of the SRA while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise.</P>
      <P>Credit unions have been regulated under separate legislation from financial institutions, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Credit Union Act, 1997. The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, provides that this will continue to be the case. The functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Credit Union Act will be carried out by a registrar of credit unions within the overall framework of the proposed new regulatory authority, but the basis of that regulation will continue to be the Credit Union Act, 1997. I have no intentions of changing this basic position. There is nothing in the Bill which requires credit unions to be treated like commercial financial institutions, such as banks.</P>
      <P>I have signalled my intention to propose amendments on Committee Stage of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, which would alter the reporting relationship of the registrar of credit unions, to bring the position more fully within the framework of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The reporting relationship of the registrar would be similar to that proposed for the consumer director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new chief executive designate and the acting secretary to the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority wrote recently to the ILCU in relation to the manner in which they intend that credit unions should be regulated. They stated the following: the members of the interim IFSRA recognise and understand the important role that the credit union movement plays in this country; they recognise both the size and reach of the movement, its not for profit and voluntary nature and its broad support amongst the communities, which it serves; they recognise that credit unions have different functions and objectives to commercial financial institutions &ndash; such as banks and building societies &ndash; and that the regulation of the credit union movement must be appropriate to those functions and objectives; they highlight that, for this reason, the Government, in making clear its acceptance of all these principles, is proposing a separate statutory post of registrar of credit unions who will work under the requirements and protections of the Credit <Col N="234" /> Union Act; and the IFSRA wants to work positively with the ILCU and they are open to discussing the valuable role that the ILCU's field officers play in assisting league members. The IFSRA's only concern with the legislation as currently drafted is the accountability of the registrar of credit unions.</P>
    <P>The supervision of credit unions by the new regulatory authority should not be viewed as a threat to the movement but rather as a development that will work to the advantage of the credit union movement and member/customers of credit unions.</P>
    <P>My concern as Minister for Finance is that credit unions should be properly regulated, consistent with their role and nature and within a proper framework. The amendments I propose impact on the accountability of the position of registrar of credit unions, not on the powers of the registrar/IFSRA in relation to the regulation of credit unions which remain the same. It would be remiss of me not to have looked again at this issue if, as was the case, the body of people who it is proposed will regulate the financial sector had expressed concerns about the structure within which the regulation will take place.</P>
    <P>The autonomous position of the registrar also required to be re-examined in the context of views received from the European Central Bank. I am required by the treaty to consult the ECB on certain financial legislation. The amendments I am proposing will address the issues raised by the ECB.</P>
    <P>I fully support the credit union movement. I believe that the position of a statutory registrar of credit unions within the regulatory authority will ensure the strong voluntary and community ethos of the movement continues.</P>

      <P>Ireland is one of ten member states that apply VRT. The other nine are Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. These taxes are operated in a variety of ways and are not directly comparable with VRT as applied in Ireland. Many other countries also tax fuel at a higher rate, including the UK. All these factors must be borne in mind in making comparisons.</P>
      <P>VRT in Ireland, as in a number of other member states, is a significant source of tax revenue to fund necessary public services. In Ireland VRT generates over &euro;800 million per year. To replace this would require, for example, an increase of over 2 percentage points in the standard rate of income tax.</P>
      <P>The following table outlines the VRT and registration fees applicable in each member state. It is based on a study carried out by COWI Consulting Engineers and Planners, as in November 2001 for the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>The latest inflation projection published by my Department was included with the budget documentation. It estimated then that inflation, as measured by annual changes in the consumer price index, would be 4.8% in 2003. The increase in the CPI will be higher in the next few months but will ease as the year progresses. Accordingly, my Department projects a further easing beyond 2003 to around 2½% by 2005.</P>
      <P>The main driving factor behind Ireland's current inflation rate is the high level of services sector inflation. This partly reflects the high levels of wage increases in the economy. It is important that wage pressures are not allowed to lead to a deterioration in competitiveness which would result in lower growth and higher unemployment.</P>

      <P>In 1994 the UN General Assembly endorsed the programme of action which had been adopted by the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. The programme of action established an agreed international framework for tackling such key issues as maternal health, infant mortality and reproductive health care and services. It established a firm basis for the work of the United Nations in relation to population activities and reproductive health. The United Nations population fund uses the principles and objectives of the programme of action as the mandate for its operations.</P>
      <P>In 1999 the United Nations General Assembly reviewed the implementation of the Cairo programme of action and adopted a set of actions for its further implementation. Its implementation is monitored and assessed at the national, regional and international levels by the Commission on Population and Development, a subsidiary body of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Ireland is a member of the Commission for the years 2002 to 2005.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the timing, format and content of a possible review by the UN in 2004 of the implementation of the Cairo programme of action are taking place at the UN General Assembly in New York.</P>
      <P>The 2004 review of the Cairo conference has become part of a broader discussion in the UN about the integrated follow-up to all UN conferences. Efforts are under way to streamline the follow-up processes to the various UN conferences held in the 1990s to avoid a proliferation of future review meetings. It is likely that no firm decisions on a follow-up in 2004 to the International Conference on Population and Development will be taken until UN member states have agreed a new framework for the integrated follow-up to UN conferences. The working group which is being established to develop such a new framework is expected to report in June 2003.</P>
      <P>Ireland remains firmly committed to the outcome of the 1994 conference which is fully consistent with our national position on the sensitive issues of reproductive health care and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 conference also agreed development targets such as a 75% reduction in maternal mortality by 2015. This target was reaffirmed in the <Col N="239" /> UN Millennium Declaration and its associated goals. Ireland Aid's development co-operation activities are focused on contributing to the achievement of the millennium development goals, including the goal on reducing maternal mortality.</P>
    <P>Together with our EU partners we will work to ensure that any future reviews of the 1994 conference on population and development will further serve to promote the implementation of the Cairo programme of action and the achievement of the millennium development goals.</P>

      <Quest>if he will highlight with the British authorities the difficult situation being faced by residents of the Short Strand area in east Belfast as a result of sectarian attacks; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that these residents believe that the British Army and the Police Service of Northern Ireland are doing nothing to prevent this; his views on this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Intense sectarian violence has blighted a number of areas of Northern Ireland in the past year and a half, particularly at the height of the marching season this summer. Certain interface areas in Belfast have been particularly affected by sectarian attacks ranging from pipe bomb campaigns to individual assaults. The situation was particularly acute in the Short Strand area of east Belfast during the summer months, beginning in mid-May, with attacks on homes, the firing of missiles and blast bombs at residents and a temporary blockade of the doctor's surgery and other social services. The situation has eased in intensity since the end of August although there have been disturbances on occasion since then, for example over the weekend of 15-16 November.</P>
      <P>In early June the Taoiseach publicly acknowledged the concerns of the people of this area by stating &ldquo;who have seen their community dwindle considerably because of the difficulties over years, [and who] feel that they are under huge threat.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach subsequently raised his concerns about the situation directly with Prime Minister Blair. In addition, I met political representatives of the area and, during meetings with the then Secretary of State Dr. John Reid and with his successor Paul Murphy, I raised the need for increased security measures to protect vulnerable residents at exposed interface areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the summer officials from my Department and the Government's representatives based at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast were in ongoing contact with local elected and community representatives, including visiting the area on a regular basis to assess the situation at first hand. The urgent need for both effective and impartial policing and <Col N="240" /> increased security measures to protect the residents of the Short Strand was stressed in frequent contacts with the British side.</P>
    <P>It should be acknowledged that since late August stronger and more focused security measures have been implemented in east Belfast and this is to be welcomed. The view of PSNI is that the majority of the serious attacks here and at other interfaces have been conducted by loyalist paramilitaries. At a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board in early September, the then PSNI Assistant Chief Constable for Belfast said that, although people from both sides were involved in disorder, violence and paramilitary attacks, a significant majority of serious violence was coming from loyalist paramilitaries, directed at the Catholic community, the PSNI and the British Army.</P>
    <P>The Government has consistently called for tougher police action against the organisers and perpetrators of this loyalist violence. Recent actions, including arrests, by PSNI, since the coming into office of new Chief Constable Hugh Orde, are to be welcomed in this regard but more needs to be done to assure vulnerable communities that the scourge of loyalist paramilitarism is being tackled effectively.</P>
    <P>It should be acknowledged that some Protestant communities have also suffered from sectarian violence. Such attacks have occurred in Cluan Place, at the Short Strand interface in east Belfast, as well as in the Fountain area in Derry and at certain interfaces in north Belfast.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work closely with the British Government and the political parties to address the issues surrounding sectarian and paramilitary violence, to bring about more effective policing of interface areas, and to ensure that increased additional security measures are available to residents of these areas, when required, as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Local communities also have a role to play in reducing interface tensions. I welcome the fact that various efforts and initiatives are being undertaken at local level to achieve this end.</P>

      <P>At present the courses run in the State that allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the Bachelor of Education degree and the 18 month graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education which specialise in the training of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The graduate diploma course is a full-time course run to enable third level graduates to train as primary teachers.</P>
      <P>All aspects of primary teacher training are the subject of ongoing review between my Department and the colleges of education. My Department is also examining further options for addressing the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests. In this context my Department will consult the colleges of education in the near future with regard to the provision of modular type courses for secondary trained teachers with the necessary academic requirement in Irish.</P>

      <P>I consider that the matter of safety on our roads is a serious one for all of us. My Department requested National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to set up a task force on driver education in 2001. It has been authorised to proceed with the first phase of the proposals of the task force, that is a research phase. This will include, <i>inter alia</i>, carrying out an inventory of the work that is already being done in the area of driver education in various schools. Some of the models studied will include taking the driving test while still in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another recent development in driver education at school level is the issue to all second <Col N="244" /> level schools in September 2001 of a pack called Staying Alive. This is a road safety resource produced under the aegis of the National Safety Council. It was produced primarily for transition year students but can be used at any stage of senior cycle.</P>
    <P>In the revised primary curriculum there is a unit on safety and protection. This is part of the social, personal and health education syllabus and refers especially to travelling with care. This syllabus is addressed at all classes of primary school from infants upwards.</P>

It is intended that the parents of the children will be fully involved in this process. These individualised child centred programmes will form the basis for future support service inputs.</P>
      <P>The senior officers of my Department and the Department of Health and Children, who have already been nominated to assist local management in resolving the current difficulties, will play an active role in advancing these arrangements.

      <P>Relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is an integral part of social personal and health education. A support service for social personal and health education, SPHE, up to junior cycle was established in 2000 and has been providing training and support to schools in all aspects of SPHE since then. A total of 570 schools have developed links with the service and 420 of these have made provision for a timetabled SPHE programme. The target is that all schools will have begun the implementation of SPHE, which will include RSE, by September 2003. Extra training and support in the RSE element of SPHE is currently being offered to schools by the RSE support service in conjunction with the SPHE support service.</P>

      <P>PPPs are essentially a partnership between public sector organisations and private sector investors and businesses for the purpose of designing, planning, financing, constructing and/or operating infrastructure projects normally provided through traditional procurement mechanisms by the State for periods of around 25 years.</P>
      <P>As with traditional procurement, PPPs are subject to EU procurement legislation. Therefore, any project over the procurement threshold must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union and the operator of the proposed PPP will then be selected on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure. In the case of the first schools pilot project, five schools were bundled together to form one contract to make the project economically viable.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the PPP process of procurement is not a suitable mechanism for the provision of school accommodation in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The contract for the provision of a bundle of five post-primary schools, including St. Attracta's Community School, Tubbercurry, under the first education public private partnership project was signed in November 2001 with Jarvis Projects Limited. This pilot project was developed on a design, build, finance and operate basis. While the maintenance and operation of the buildings is a matter for Jarvis for the duration of the service contract, in this case 25 years, the management of the schools and their day to day running will remain with the school management authorities. The State will retain legal ownership of all properties.</P>
      <P>The construction cost of providing the five schools is &euro;60.66 million, excluding furniture, fittings and equipment. Comparison of build costs is not a valid measurement when comparing PPP with traditional procurement, bearing in mind that the PPP contract includes the maintenance and operation of the school for the duration of the 25 year contract and PPP schools are designed and constructed specifically to meet this output.</P>
      <P>The annual cost of the project is &euro;10.122 million per year for the first three years of operation. The cost from the fourth year onwards is &euro;9.716 million. Under the terms of the project agreement, the European Investment Bank may refinance 50% of the senior debt two years into the operational phase of the project. This would further reduce the annual cost of the project.</P>

Accordingly, all boards will be aware of the actual staffing position for their schools.</P>
      <P>The independent appeals board on mainstream staffing allocations commenced operation at the beginning of the 2002-2003 school year. The purpose of the board is to allow for the independent consideration of appeals, under certain criteria, on mainstream staffing allocations. These criteria were outlined in Circular 19/02, which issued to all boards of management in August 2002.</P>
      <P>The appeals board operates independently of my Department and its decisions are final. It is not open to me to interfere in the operation of the appeals board. Decisions of the board are communicated to the board of management of the school which submits the appeal.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department decided to examine post primary provision in the New Ross area with a view to possible rationalisation. This decision was taken in light of capital grant applications received from all five post primary schools in the centre. It was also decided to extend the scope of this examination to include the five primary schools in the area.</P>
      <P>In view of the extent of this examination, it was decided to appoint a facilitator, Dr. Tom McCarthy, to consult with the local providers with a view to identifying the key issues in relation to primary and post primary school provision in the area. Dr. McCarthy's report has now been received and is currently under examination in the planning and building unit of my Department. It is intended to decide how best to respond to the issues identified in the light of available resources and the competing demands of other schools.</P>

      <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is agreed for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Scoil Mhuire was 318 pupils on 30 September 2002. The school has a staffing of a principal, 12 mainstream class teachers, one teacher due to its disadvantaged status, two teachers under the urban disadvantage programme, two learning support teachers, one special class teacher for pupils with a mild general learning disability, one home school community liaison teacher and one resource teacher for pupils with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The organisation of classes is the function of the managerial authorities of the school and consequently the information relating to class sizes is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has improved significantly from 21.7 in the 1997-98 school year to 19.0 in the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>The Agreed Programme for Government sets out a commitment to continue to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools, progressively introduce maximum class guidelines which will ensure that the average size of classes for children in junior classes will be below international best practice guidelines of 20:1, and implement changes to retention and support policies which will assist schools in areas of significant disadvantage to recruit and retain teachers.</P>

The pre-selection of contracts for the new school building project were received in the building unit of my Department in July 2002. As with all proposals involving major capital expenditure, it is essential to confirm that the provision of a new second level school in Newport is necessary, having regard to pupil numbers and existing provision in the general area, before it can be allowed to proceed to the next stage, invitation of tenders. It is in this context that a review of second level provision in the Newport area is being undertaken by the planning section of my Department.

      <P>County Roscommon VEC has applied to my Department for funding for the refurbishment of St. Mary's Hall at Boyle Community College. This hall is owned by the parish of Boyle and as such it is not possible for my Department to take this usual approach to investment in the building. In order to allow my Department to consider grant aid for any refurbishment works, County Roscommon VEC was asked to negotiate a lease with the trustees of the parish. The VEC recently submitted a draft lease prepared by solicitors acting on behalf of the trustees of the parish concerning the VEC's agreement to accept a 25-year lease of the hall. This lease has been forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor's Office and pending legal advice a response will issue to the VEC. In addition, officials from the building unit of my Department recently visited the hall to assess the works required to upgrade. They are currently preparing a report on the works required.</P>

      <P>The RAPID programme is designed to harness the opportunities and resources of the national development plan through the prioritisation of investment to the 45 most deprived communities in the country (25 urban areas and 20 provincial towns). To date, I have allocated more than &euro;1.8 million in respect of RAPID project proposals submitted to my Department. This figure encompasses 16 RAPID proposals that I have approved, in whole or in part, relating to a number of areas including third level access, education guidance counselling, resource teachers and teaching hours as well as capital refurbishment and extension projects. These proposals are located in a number of the areas identified as disadvantaged under the RAPID programme in parts of Dublin, Cork, and Limerick. I have arranged for a list of these projects to be forwarded separately to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also recently allocated more than &euro;5 million to the Dublin City, County Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork City, Louth and Limerick City Vocational Education Committees under the new back to education initiative, BTEI, which will provide important second chance education opportunities in these communities. A proportion of these block allocations will facilitate some funding of RAPID area applications. Decisions on allocations to individual projects within these amounts are matters for individual vocational education committees. In addition, I recently appointed 34 community education facilitators as a new nationwide service operating under the <Col N="258" /> vocational education committees, who will be an important resource for RAPID areas within their remits.</P>
    <P>The CLÁR programme complements the RAPID programme by concentrating resources on the 16 most disadvantaged rural areas. To date I have allocated &euro;10,000 to Líonra, the regional higher education network of the BMW region, for a scoping study relating to the Ballinafad Field Study Centre. In addition, my Department is engaged in ongoing discussions with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which is the lead department with responsibility for the co-ordination of the CLÁR programme, with a view to clarifying the priority education needs of the rural areas involved. When the priority needs of the areas involved have been identified, I will then consider how my Department can most effectively address them.</P>

      <P>The monitoring of non-ionising radiation from high-voltage electricity transmission powerlines has been undertaken on a regular basis by ESB and ESB International for nearly twenty years. Two groups are assigned to do this work around the ESB regions. Typically 50 surveys are undertaken each year.</P>
      <P>Electromagnetic field strengths are amenable to mathematical analysis. It is possible to make an accurate calculation of these strengths as a function of current, voltage, pylon height, and conductor configuration. A major study undertaken by ESBI in September 1993 demonstrated a high level of agreement between the measured and calculated magnetic field levels associated with ESB's 110kV, 220kV, and 400kV transmission lines.</P>
      <P>The results of all the foregoing studies, a random sample of which have been independently appraised by my Department's chief technical adviser, show that nowhere are members of the public living in the vicinity of overhead high voltage transmission lines exposed to field strengths that exceed the acceptable levels recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, nor those levels more recently proposed by the EU Council of Health Ministers in its recommendation of 12 July 1999 concerning the limitation of public exposure to electromagnetic fields.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the recent heavy storms have had an impact on the livelihoods of certain fishermen. Fishing is a highly weather-dependant activity and it is in many respects an occupational hazard that fishing patterns are disturbed by bad weather such as that which has occurred in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>There is no specific funding mechanism available to my Department to alleviate financial hardship in the manner suggested. Under EU state aid rules, approval for financial assistance to the fishing industry in whatever form must be obtained from the European Commission. Accordingly, any question of introducing a compensatory measure of this type would fall to be considered within that framework. The European Commission has consistently made it very clear that it is fundamentally opposed to aid packages for any income loss due to periods of bad weather, funded either from EU funds or from national Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not, therefore, in a position to make provision to alleviate financial hardship in this instance. I would expect that private insurance <Col N="264" /> arrangements would in any event have been made to cover such eventualities.</P>
    <P>The Government is keenly aware of the difficulties faced by fishermen, particularly those who operate out of smaller inshore boats, as a result of adverse weather conditions. For this reason the fishing assist scheme was introduced in the late 1990s to protect the livelihoods of fishermen during periods when they are unable to fish and have very low incomes. This scheme may be of benefit to certain fishermen affected by the recent storms and I would encourage them to contact the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to establish the possibilities.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my Department had any function in deciding the location of the 2003 Irish Open. Neither did any agency under the aegis of my Department make the decision in relation to the location of this event. The Irish Open is a premier international golfing event. It is in the top rank of European PGA Tour events. The Open is one of the major sporting events in Ireland. Its importance in tourism marketing can be gauged by the fact that it has a worldwide television audience of the region of 200 million and is seen in 90 countries worldwide.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that, since the termination of the relationship with its major sponsor last year, the future of the Irish Open had been in some doubt. Bord Fáilte has, in recent years, invested in the considerable tourism marketing opportunities provided by the Irish Open as part of a wider and successful strategy which involves exploiting the marketing opportunities presented by a number of major international sports events held in Ireland. Bord Fáilte pays for a package of promotional benefits, including television, to highlight Ireland and its tourism merits.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte had indicated its willingness to continue its marketing investment around the Irish Open, if the European PGA Tour could put together a suitable financial package to preserve the event. The European Tour succeeded in doing this and secured a lead sponsor for the event. There is a very clear legal framework for dealing with the issue raised by the Deputy. I put that framework in place as Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform. I believe that the advent of that framework has been a contributing factor to a the current position where, I am informed, only two of the clubs affiliated to the Golfing Union of Ireland, are now male-only clubs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 289 together.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following the submission and approval of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents and tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works (OPW), evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>

Offaly County Council has advised my Department that it is not in a position to make any financial commitment to proceed with any of the swimming pool projects in 2002 and is to report back to my Department when it has a clearer picture of its anticipated financial position for 2003.</P>

In addition, those projects located in CLÁR regions which were subsequently allocated funding under the sports capital programme received an additional 'top-up' allocation contributed from the funding provided under the CLÁR programme. In all, a total of 86 projects in CLÁR regions were provisionally allocated a total of &euro;5,153,000 of which &euro;874,500 was from funding to be allocated directly from the CLÁR programme. To date in 2002, a total of &euro;258,319 has been paid out to sports capital projects in CLÁR regions, as follows:</P>

    <P>There is no specific funding available in my Department for distribution under the &ldquo;Revitalising Areas through Planning, Investment and Development&rdquo; (RAPID) programme. Targeted areas are, however, prioritised for investment and development under the sport capital programme.</P>
    <P>Currently, projects located in disadvantaged areas are prioritised in the process of assessing <Col N="269" /> applications under the sports capital programme. Disadvantaged areas are those which have been designated by Government for special support through the Regional Operational Programmes of the National Development Plan, i.e. areas supported by Area Partnership Companies as designated by Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd. RAPID areas come within this definition. Under the 2002 sports capital programme, a total of almost &euro;44.4 million was allocated to projects in these designated disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are currently consulting with the RAPID national monitoring committee on how targeted areas can be prioritised within the 2003 sport capital programme. <Col N="270" /> As the proposals for the development of sport facilities contained in the area implementation plans were not submitted to my Department prior to the closing date for the 2002 Sport Capital Programme, it was not possible to prioritise them in relation to this year's programme.</P>
    <P>Of the projects listed in the area implementation plans submitted subsequently for consideration, 18 would normally be eligible for applying for funding under the sports capital programme. Of these, 13 had not applied for funding under the 2002 sports capital programme and were advised to prepare applications for funding under the 2003 programme and five had actually applied independently to the programme; of which four had been allocated funding. These were as follows:</P>

      <P>A chief of the name is a person recognised by the Chief Herald of Ireland as the most senior known male descendant of the last inaugurated, or <i>de facto</i>, chief of that name in Gaelic Ireland at the end of the sixteenth century. Such recognition is always provisional upon no more senior representative emerging. It amounts to no more than recognition of a genealogical fact and does not confer, confirm or imply any rights in law or any particular status or title.</P>
      <P>The Chief Herald is dealing with a number of cases where recognition of chiefs of the name was granted in the past. Legal advice was sought and received from the Attorney General's Office on aspects of the cases. The examination by the Chief Herald which was at a preliminary stage only when the legal issues arose cannot be concluded until the legal advice has been considered.</P>

      <P>The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, provides funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities. Under the programme, funding is allocated on the basis of individual applications received with special priority being given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to making allocations under the programme, my Department consults, as appropriate, when assessing applications, with other relevant Departments and agencies, including the Irish Sports Council, with a view to ensuring co-ordination in the provision of sport and recreational facilities at local level. Since 1998, over &euro;213 million has been allocated under the sports capital programme to over 2,900 deserving projects in villages, towns and parishes all over the country. In that period the annual allocation increased by over 940% from just over &euro;7.5 million in 1998 to almost &euro;78.6 million in 2002. Of that allocation in 2002, a total of almost &euro;20.4 million was for projects classified as &lsquo;Community/Mixed' which would include recreational facilities provided in community centres <Col N="271" /> and community-based facilities and projects where more than one sport or recreational activity was available.</P>
    <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, grants of up to &euro;3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools throughout the country, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room. A total of &euro;57.14 million is available in funding under the programme, representing a 400% increase on the allocation under the previous pool programme.</P>
    <P>Given the massive increase in investment I have outlined above, it is clear that, under this and the previous Government, there has been a huge improvement in the level of sport and recreational facilities being provided all over the country. In the context of such increased investment it is now timely to consider its impact and to formulate a new strategic plan for the provision of such facilities in the future. Such a plan, as outlined in the Agreed Programme for Government, is currently being put in place by my Department.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the number of speech and language therapists employed in each health board region. The following table sets out the information requested.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of speech and language therapy services is a matter for each health board through the service planning process. The Deputy may, however, be aware that intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy, both at local and national level. These measures are reflected in the increase of 54 speech and language therapists (+15.6%) employed in the public health service over the past two years. Relevant developments include the continued implementation of the recommendations of the expert group report on various health professions, which include new pay scales and career structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the planned significant expansion in the number of training places in speech and language therapy through the implementation of the recommendations of the Bacon report. Implementation of the Action Plan for People Management, published last month, is expected to make an important contribution to the retention of key healthcare personnel including speech and language therapists.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 to 299, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The tribunal of inquiry chaired by Mr. Justice Finlay heard that, between November 1991 and December 1994, donors in the Munster region who had positive ELISA tests for antibodies to hepatitis C were not informed of their test results. One of the donors, known to the tribunal as Donor L, subsequently initiated proceedings in the High Court seeking damages arising from the delay in notifying him of his infection with hepatitis C. I have been cited as one of the respondents in that action. As part of the preparations for that action, my Department made detailed inquiries of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS). In particular, the Department sought information on the number of other donors who had been treated in a similar fashion. It also brought the matter to the attention of Transfusion Positive and Positive Action, the main support groups representing persons infected with hepatitis C, to determine what action needed to be taken to promote the interests of the donors concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department had a number of meetings with the two groups earlier this year. In addition, I met both the groups and the IBTS about this matter. I have agreed that there will be an independent investigation of donor notification procedures in relation to positive Hepatitis C test results in the IBTS at both the Dublin and Munster centres of the IBTS. I have also agreed to a request from Positive Action for an investigation of certain issues relating to anti-D donors. I have been considering the format of the investigation and intend to make a decision on the matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question in relation to research, it is intended that this will be examined as part of the forthcoming investigation and I am not in a position to comment at this stage.</P>

    <P>The Irish Society for Rheumatology has prepared a report on rheumatology manpower which was submitted to my Department and the health agencies earlier this year. Comhairle na nOspidéal carried out a review of rheumatology and rehabilitation services in 1995 and I understand that comhairle has appointed a committee to update this review in light of the report from the Irish Society for Rheumatology. I expect that the comhairle committee 's review will be completed in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards and authorities in the first instance. Last June, my Department provided funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of <Col N="276" /> orthodontic treatment, on a once off basis. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The Mid-Western Health Board received &euro;0.451 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</P>
      <P>A grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created to address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the orthodontic service. In addition, my Department is funding 11 dentists this year from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</P>
      <P>The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments. In the short-term, additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
      <P>Finally, the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board has informed me that, at the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 2,090 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board's area. This is an increase of 497 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <P>The pharmacy review group, chaired by Professor Michael Mortell, was established by me in November 2001 to review the pharmacy regulations. Its full terms of references are as follows: facilitating the provision, maintenance and development of a high quality pharmacy service to service recipients; maximising the potential to increase competition within the sector with a view to ensuring lower prices and improved services to <Col N="277" /> the consumer as envisaged in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland; assessing and responding to the recommendations in the OECD report on the current restrictions on pharmacists educated in other EU countries with a view to enabling this country to discontinue the derogation incorporated in article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC on the free movement of pharmacists; ensuring that the opening hours of pharmacies facilitate consumers and meet all reasonable health needs of the population in its area; assessing the extent to which the 1996 regulations, together with the community pharmacy contract, have achieved their objectives in regard to locating new pharmacies in remote or disadvantaged areas and their impact on the quality of the service provided by the pharmacists to the public; taking full account of pharmacy regulation in other jurisdictions; taking full account of the wider regulatory framework in which pharmacy operates; considering how a universal service and public service obligation can be identified and met and assessing any funding consequences which may arise.</P>
      <P>The group has based its approach on the principles set out by the Mandelkern group for evidence-based policy formulation in the Mandelkern group on better regulation final report, 13 November 2001. These include public and interest group consultation; analysis of the existing position (ex-post analysis); and analysis of possible options (ex-ante analysis). The group consulted widely and, in particular, with consumer interests. The data-based ex-post analysis of the regulations, which were revoked by me in January 2002, following legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, has been completed, and pharmacy models developed by the group are currently undergoing ex-ante analysis. The group is on schedule to complete its task and report to me in January 2003, at which stage the outcome of its deliberations will be known.</P>

      <P>The introduction of fitness to practise procedures for members of the pharmacy profession is under active consideration in my Department in the context of the development of an outline scheme of new legislation to amend and update the Pharmacy Acts. I expect to be in a position to publish a new Pharmacy Bill during 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dentists Act, 1985 set up the Dental Council as the statutory authority for the promotion of high standards of professional education and <Col N="278" /> conduct among dentists. Part V of the Act sets out the procedures with regard to issues of fitness to practise for dentists, which are currently in effect. The legislation currently providing for the regulation of the nursing profession is the Nurses Act, 1985. The 1985 Act provided for the regulation, control and education of nurses and other matters related to the practice of nursing. It also provided for the establishment of a re-constituted Bord Altranais. The regulation of the nursing profession was examined by the Commission on Nursing and certain recommendations were made, including recommendations in relation to fitness to practise procedures. These recommendations will require legislative change and will be incorporated into the new Nurses Bill, which is in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 the Medical Council is the body statutorily charged with the registration of medical practitioners, including fitness to practise issues. In order to ensure patient care and safety it is necessary for the council to be absolutely certain of the suitability of a medical practitioner to be registered. In order to do this the Medical Council must satisfy itself as to the qualifications and good standing of any applicant for registration, and insists on the provision of appropriate evidence that these requirements are met in the interests of patient safety.</P>
    <P>Where information is received stating that disciplinary proceedings have resulted in erasure of a doctor from a register in another country, or some restriction on their ability to practise freely has been imposed, this information is referred to the fitness to practise committee for consideration under Part V of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The statutory provisions include that the council may apply to the High Court for an order suspending a doctor's registration where the public interest is considered to be at immediate risk. Any doctor about whom a complaint is received by the Medical Council is subject to the disciplinary proceedings provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Preparation of heads of a Bill for a new medical practitioners Act is well advanced, and the current statutory provisions in relation to the fitness to practise of medical practitioners are being carefully examined in this context. The Lynott report published earlier this year, which recommends that appropriate checks be made by employers with regulatory bodies in countries in which a doctor was previously registered, will be taken into consideration as part of this process. All of these measures maximise the protection of the consumer through agreed fitness to practise procedures governing health professionals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 and 341 together.</P>
      <P>The drugs payment scheme replaced the drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes on 1 July 1999. The DPS provided that families only have to meet the first £42 (&euro;53.33) a month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The drug cost subsidisation scheme threshold was £32 (&euro;40.63) a month per certified individual, and for the drugs refund scheme it was £90 (&euro;114.28) a quarter for each eligible person and dependants.</P>
      <P>The DPS was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced at a later date. Regulations fixing the threshold for the new scheme at £42 (&euro;53.33) per month could have been made in July 1999 under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970 but, as Government approval had been obtained to amend that section, it was decided to defer making the regulations until the Act was actually amended. At that time it was envisaged that the amending provision would be enacted very quickly.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, however, difficulties and delays arose in securing drafting time and parliamentary time for new legislation. Following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's office in October 2000, regulations to fix the threshold at £42 (&euro;53.33) per month were made under the existing section 59 of the 1970 Act and came into effect on 1 March 2001. The aggregate financial benefits for patients under the DPS are clearly significantly greater than the old schemes. The total patient benefit under the drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes in 1988 was £75 million and that was the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS subvention to patients was £110 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to £140 in 2001, an increase of 87% in three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As claimants derived greater overall benefits, as reflected in the significant increase in spending, the issue of possible refunds was not addressed at that time. My Department has reviewed the position in relation to this question. The value of individual refunds would be between &euro;1 and &euro;250, with most refunds at the lower end of the range. Many claimants would have also received tax relief on these expenses.

      <P>Public bodies are required to charge fees in accordance with section 47 of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 and under section 10 may refuse access where the payment of such fees is outstanding. The South-Eastern Health Board has processed a large number of requests for the person referred to by the Deputy. In the context of outstanding fees and significant effort required to meet ongoing requests, the board has decided to provide information to the requester outside the Act to the extent to which such information is readily available. The board has written to the requester regarding this and has attempted to explain the operation of the Act to them on many occasions. The Act provides requesters with an independent appeal mechanism with which this person is familiar and it is for the Information Commissioner to review such decisions under the Act.</P>

      <QRef>[25531/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent statistics available on sexually transmitted infections, STIs, published by the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, show that there were 1,343 cases of chlamydia notified in 2000, an increase of 54.5% on the pre<Col N="285" /> vious year. There were a total of 8,869 cases of STIs notified to the NDSC in 2000 compared with an overall total of 6,993 in 1999, representing an increase of 26.8% in notifications over the two year period. There has been an increasing upward trend in notifications year on year since the mid 1990s. While some of the increase may be due to an increased public and professional awareness of chlamydia infection, improved acceptability of STI clinics and the availability of more sophisticated diagnostic techniques, these figures undoubtedly reflect an increase in unsafe sexual practices.</P>
      <P>A sub-committee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the NDSC is reviewing the current system of notification of STIs and will make recommendations on future systems. The sub-committee is also investigating the need for screening for chlamydia in Ireland.</P>
      <P>More than half of the total number of STI cases and 830 of the 1,343 chlamydia cases notified in 2000 were notified in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, area. I have been informed by the ERHA that a working group has recently been established to develop sexual health strategy for the region. This strategy will be primarily directed towards promoting sexual health and well-being and preventing the transmission of STIs. I am also advised that a pilot programme for chlamydia screening is being conducted at present in a maternity hospital in the ERHA region.</P>
      <P>Sexually transmitted infections are included in the remit of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, NASC. The report of this committee, &ldquo;AIDS Strategy 2000&rdquo; was published in June 2000. It makes recommendations for dealing with HIV-AIDS and other STIs over the coming years. My Department, through the National AIDS Strategy Committee and its sub-committees on education and prevention, surveillance and care and management, is currently working to implement these recommendations.</P>
      <P>Education is an important aspect in raising awareness of the dangers of engaging in risky sexual behaviour which could result in a sexually transmitted infection. Health boards undertake information and awareness activities at regional level and among the issues addressed is the prevention of sexually transmitted infection. Where appropriate, the health boards work in conjunction with and fund voluntary organisations in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department is also currently involved in running several sexual health programmes. These include phase one of the &ldquo;Think Twice&rdquo; campaign, aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 year old age group, which was launched in November 2000 and has to date resulted in the following activities: the dissemination of an information pack to members of the media, health professionals and other relevant staff in the field of sexual health; the introduction of an advertising campaign with the &ldquo;Think Twice&rdquo; message; four regional work<Col N="286" /> shops, two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Sligo, with social partners and interest groups which facilitated discussion and information gathering on the topic; research, via focus groups, to establish needs and appropriate content for an information handbook; collaboration with the Southern Health Board and its specialist staff to finalise resource material for the adult population. This has resulted in the production of an information booklet which is currently at the design stage and will be available shortly; relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme and social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum within the school setting which, in addition to many other health topics, also deal with sexual health and well being; convenience advertising campaign which specifically targets entertainment venues by putting posters in male and female toilets. The health promotion unit has recently expanded this programme to several new venues and this new phase of convenience advertising includes a take away message for the first time. Development of the next phase of campaign posters has just begun and it will include a specific message on chlamydia.</P>
    <P>Additional funding has been provided to health boards in recent years to address the problems of HIV-AIDS and STIs. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the facilities in place. There are currently six consultants specialising in the treatment of HIV-AIDS-STIs, of whom five are in Dublin &ndash; one of whom deals with children &ndash; and one in Cork. My Department has also provided funding in respect of the appointment of a new infectious diseases consultant in the Western Health Board.</P>

      <P>Arising from the health strategy, &ldquo;Quality and <Col N="287" /> Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You&rdquo;, one of the key actions for dealing with the public hospital waiting lists was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. The NTPF was set up in April and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June.</P>
      <P>Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public hospital patients waiting longest on in-patient lists so that they can be offered treatment under this initiative. The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists over 12 months and children waiting over six months. Public patients, who satisfy this criteria, can apply to their GP, hospital consultant or to their local health board liaison officer to seek to have their treatment carried out under the NTPF. The patient's consent to being treated under this scheme is also sought. Capacity is sourced by the NTPF and patients are referred for treatment. To date capacity has been sourced in private hospitals in Ireland, Northern Ireland and in England. In the current year the NTPF expects to treat up to 2,000 patients and from January 2003 it expects to refer 600 patients per month for treatment.</P>
      <P>The national treatment purchase fund has launched a national lo-call number 1890-720-820. Calls from anywhere in Ireland are charged at the local rate. The public, who requires information, is encouraged to ring this number and its queries will be answered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant progress is being achieved in expanding the number of therapy training places, including in speech and language therapy, in line with the recommendations of the report &ldquo;Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in <Col N="290" /> the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists&rdquo; prepared by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates and published in June 2001. A detailed assessment of the bids to supply these additional training places was carried out by an inter-agency group comprising the Higher Education Authority, the Department of Education and Science, the health boards and my Department with regard to proposed curricula; availability of high-quality clinical placements; speed at which these places could be provided and the recommendation contained in the Bacon report that consideration should be given to the development and validation of courses at different institutions.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the work of this group, in May 2002, I, along with the Minister for Education and Science, jointly announced the creation of 75 additional training places in speech and language therapy as follows: University of Limerick: Master of Science in Speech and Language Therapy; 25 places. University College Cork: Bachelor of Science in Speech and Language Therapy; 25 places. National University of Ireland, Galway: Bachelor of Science in Speech and Language Therapy; 25 places.</P>
    <P>I understand that preparations for the initial intake to these courses is currently under way. Intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the continued implementation of the recommendations of the expert group report on various health professions, which include new pay scales and career structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. These measures are reflected in the increase of 54 speech and language therapists (+15.6%) employed in the public health service over the past two years.</P>

      <P>Data on mortality are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and published in the annual and quarterly reports on vital statistics. During the past 20 years two deaths have been coded to conditions directly attributable to radiation. One of these was recorded as acute pulmonary manifestations due to radiation while the other was recorded as overdose of radiation in therapy. The effects of radiation may be a contributory factor in other deaths but it is not possible to establish a causal link based on death registration data. The exception to this is malignant melanoma of the skin where it is clear that exposure to sunlight radiation is the principal cause. Between 50 and 90 people per year die from this condition in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has statutory responsibility for monitoring compliance with radiological protection legislation. The institute carries out surveillance programmes to monitor levels of radioactivity in air, drinking water and foodstuffs. The data presented in its report &ldquo;Environmental Radioactivity Surveillance Programme 1999 and 2000&rdquo;, published in February 2002, demonstrate that the levels of artificial radioactivity in the Irish terrestrial environment, including foodstuffs, remain extremely low and do not pose a significant risk to health. The RPII will of course continue to monitor the exposure of people living in Ireland to all relevant sources of ionising radiation.</P>

      <P>A major capital health project for an Alzheimer's disease day care centre at Kilgarven, County Kerry, is being funded at a total cost of &euro;805,000 under the CLÁR programme. The Southern Health Board is providing &euro;528,000 to the project. CLÁR funding, provided by the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs of &euro;226,000 has been allocated, and the Alzheimer's Society has also raised &euro;51,000 for the centre. Discussions are at present ongoing regarding the provision of additional CLÁR funding for other major capital health projects. A number of small capital projects relating to health service provision in CLÁR areas are also being funded under the CLÁR programme. The total cost of these projects is &euro;2,613,311. The health boards are providing &euro;1,906,275 and the balance of &euro;707,036 is being provided by CLÁR funding. The attached schedule details the amount of CLÁR funding and the total amount of funding which has been allocated to each of these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" />In relation to the RAPID programme, Government policy is that RAPID is to be funded through the prioritisation of the identified areas and the front loading to them of a significant share of the funding allocated under the national development plan. Agencies have been asked to implement the programme from within their existing resources. Officials from my Department have written to the RAPID co-ordinators and to the chief executive officers of the relevant health authorities to request that they prioritise the list of projects for their board, paying particular attention to the top five priorities. They are also asked to consider re-prioritisation that could be <Col N="294" /> made on the basis of RAPID type projects from their 2002 allocation and which could be implemented within existing resources and to include as many prioritised RAPID proposals as possible in their service plans for 2003.</P>
    <P>An internal group comprising representatives of relevant units within the Department of Health and Children has been established to ensure co-ordination with health board counterparts in service areas for which RAPID proposals have been submitted. Until health board service plans have been received in the Department of Health and Children, it will not be possible to indicate the amount of money allocated for RAPID in 2003.</P>

      <Quest>when the long promised Civil Registration Bill will be published giving effect to the 1992 announcement regarding the decentralisation of the General Register Office from Dublin to Roscommon; the costs to date of the relocation and computerisation of the General Register Office records; and if he will commission a value for money report on the whole project since the November 1992 announcement.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The registration of births, marriages and deaths and the maintenance of permanent records of these events by An tArd-Chláraitheoir are governed by the Registration of Births and Deaths Acts 1863 to 2002 and the Marriages Acts of 1844 and 1863. This legislation also provides for the location of the General Register Office. A Civil Registration Bill currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel will provide a new legal framework for the registration of births, marriages and deaths. The passing of this legislation is one element of the civil registration modernisation programme which is a joint project between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modernisation project also involves the development of a new organisation structure and business processes for the civil registration service and the introduction of modern technology. The Bill will be presented to the House shortly. In the interim, the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002, includes a number of provisions to facilitate the maintenance of civil regis<Col N="300" /> tration records in an electronic format and the production of certificates using modern technology. The decision to decentralise the General Register Office and to computerise its archival records &ndash; all births and deaths records from 1863 and marriage records from 1844 &ndash; and the associated indexes in the special project located in Roscommon was announced in 1992. The filming and scanning of an estimated 21 million register entries to provide a database of images of the records and the conversion of the printed indexes, to an electronic format began in 1996. The costs associated with this work to date are estimated at &euro;8.1 million including &euro;1.01 million in respect of rental and fitting out of accommodation.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in the scanning of the original documents. Particular attention has been devoted to the quality assurance of both the images and the indexes. It is anticipated that the work will be completed next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children has received one proposal to date in respect of a RAPID strand II project in Athy, County Kildare. This project is a proposal for the expansion of counselling services for Athy youth and <Col N="301" /> has a revenue cost of &euro;279,055 per annum. RAPID strand II proposals were received in the Department on 4 November and are currently being processed. Officials from my Department have written to the RAPID co-ordinators and to the chief executive officers of the relevant health authorities to request that they prioritise the list of RAPID strand II projects for their boards, paying particular attention to the top five priorities. They are to include as many prioritised RAPID proposals as possible in their service plans for 2003. An internal group comprising representatives of relevant units within the Department of Health and Children has been established to ensure co-ordination with health board counterparts in service areas for which RAPID proposals have been submitted. Government policy is that RAPID is to be funded through the prioritisation of the identified areas and the front loading to them of a significant share of the funding allocated under the national development plan. Agencies have been asked to implement the programme from within their existing resources.</P>
      <P>Until health board service plans have been received in the Department of Health and Children, it will not be possible to indicate the amount of money allocated for RAPID projects in 2003.</P>

      <P>There were 30 speech and language therapists employed in the South-Western Area Health Board at the end of 2001. Intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert group on various health professions, which included new pay scales and career structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the planned significant expansion in the number of training places in speech and language therapy through the implementation of the recommendations of the report &ldquo;Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists&rdquo;, prepared by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the action plan for people management &ndash; action 108 of the health strategy published last month &ndash; is expected to make an <Col N="302" /> important contribution to the retention of key health care personnel, including speech and language therapists in the health service. Responsibility for the specific issues raised by the Deputy rests with each health board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the South-Western Area Health Board to investigate the matters raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

The Inspector noted that steady progress was being made in implementing the national policy of replacing 19th century mental hospital accommodation with acute assessment and treatment units in general hospitals and, for less acute illness, appropriate community residential premises. I am fully committed to facilitating the health boards, as far as possible, to bring about the improvements to the services identified by the Inspector in his report. Significant additional funding, both capital and revenue has been provided by my Department in recent years for this purpose.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently reviewing policy options in relation to the increased use of generic medicines in the community drugs schemes. I assure the Deputy that the quality of patient care will not be adversely affected by any changes to the operation of those schemes. Since 1 January 1993, general practitioners have been allocated an annual target budget for expenditure on drugs for their GMS patients under the indicative drug target saving scheme. Targets are determined by national norms and form part of an agreement between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation. In an attempt to limit the escalation of the annual costs of GMS drugs, general practitioners participating in the scheme are permitted to accrue savings under this scheme which can then be used to fund general practice developments at their practice premises for the benefit of their patients. A review of the scheme under<Col N="303" /> taken by Professor Michael Murphy, which was published in July 1997, found that there were changes in prescribing behaviour as a result of the scheme. Some doctors made savings through enhanced prescribing of generic medications and there were no discernible negative effects on the overall quality of prescribing.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. In this regard health boards have developed, and are continuing to develop, a modern comprehensive community-based mental health service. This has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients with a corresponding increase in the provision of a range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to continue to accelerate the growth in alternatives to hospitalisation with the further development of community-based services throughout the country. Significant additional funding both capital and revenue has been provided by my Department in recent years for this purpose. It is the responsibility of each health board to identify the needs in its area and to address those needs as far as possible from within the resources available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Safety Strategy, 1998-2002 refers to the fact that international research indicates that alcohol is a factor in up to 40% of road accidents and estimates in Ireland suggest that the problem is of similar proportions in this country. Specific data relating to the number of drink driver associated accidents in EU countries is not available. The NRA Road Accident Facts indicate that alcohol is a factor in 25% of all accidents and 33% of fatal accidents.</P>
      <P>Drink driving is a key target area for the Government's road safety strategy, and will form an integral part of the next strategy for the period beyond 2002. The specific target in the current strategy sought to achieve a reduction of 25% in the number of fatal accidents occurring between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. &ndash; these accidents are commonly drink related. This is a challenging target and provisional information for 2001 shows that the number of fatal road accidents occurring between these hours fell by 14.4% when compared with the base year of 1997. This reduction was achieved against a background of the number of drink driving detections having increased by 53% in 2001 over 1998.</P>
      <P>The strategy also provided that consideration should be given to some change in the present legal requirement for a member of the Garda Síochána to have formed opinion that a person has consumed alcohol before requesting a road side breathalyser test. At that time it was stated that the Government did not envisage the unqualified application of random breath testing within the lifetime of the strategy but that an extension of the circumstances under which a breath test can take place may be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of the Road Traffic Act, 2002 extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen. The section provides that where a driver is involved in a road accident or where a Garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed, he or she may require that the driver provide the specimen. This is in addition to the present grounds where the Garda has formed an opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol. My Department is currently consulting with the Medical Bureau of Road <Col N="308" /> Safety and the gardaí in relation to the commencement of this section.</P>
    <P>I have requested information from the European Commission in relation to application of random breath testing in other EU member states. When this information comes available, I will forward it to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>With effect from 1 June 1989 the then Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications extended the levying of the Shanwick communications charge to military traffic transiting the Atlantic. This charge is levied on transatlantic flights availing of the en-route communications service provided by Ballygireen Radio Station in County Clare. The military authorities refused to pay the charge on the grounds that military aircraft were State aircraft and thus exempt under international aviation law. The charges proved to be uncollectable.</P>
      <P>On the basis of legal advice from the then Attorney General, Department of Finance sanction was sought for the write-off of all amounts then due and the cessation of military charges with effect from 1 May 1991.

Aer Rianta, who then acted as collection agents for the Department, accordingly made a final effort to recover the moneys but without success.

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office strategy for 2000 &ndash; 2016, entitled A Platform for Change, recommends the construction of a new rail line off the Maynooth line near Clonsilla via Dunboyne to Navan. The report envisages the rail link being completed in two phases, the first being the construction of a spur from Clonsilla to Dunboyne, to be completed by 2006, and the extension of the line to Navan to be completed by 2010.</P>
      <P>To date, I have not received a proposal from Iarnród Éireann in this regard. I envisage that the strategic rail review, due to be completed shortly, will consider this project in the light of general priorities for rail investment over the next twenty years.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the National Roads Authority to <Col N="310" /> ensure that motorways and dual carriageways are equipped with appropriate containment barriers having regard to the provisions of the NRA's design manual for roads and bridges.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the NRA, as a matter of practice, keeps road design standards, including safety aspects, under regular review. In this context and as part of a recent review, I understand the NRA has decided to provide median crash barriers where the width of the central median on motorways and dual carriageways is 15 metres or less. The approach being adopted will involve the use of high containment barriers where the width of the central median is 7.5 metres or less.</P>
      <P>I understand the NRA has also decided to initiate a programme for the retrofit of barriers in medians falling into these categories in the case of existing national roads. The total 2003 provision for national roads improvement and maintenance is over &euro;1.2 billion &ndash; a 20% increase on the original estimate for 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 and 367 together.</P>
      <P>CIE submitted an application for a fares increase to my Department in July of this year. The application was made by CIE in the context of losses that have arisen as a consequence of the expansion of services in recent years, increasing congestion, rising overheads and increased wage costs following recent wage agreements.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the chairman on 19 November 2002 approving an average fares increase of 9% in respect of CIE fares to be introduced from December 2002. In devising their new fares structure, CIE were asked to have particular regard to An Agreed Programme for Government on fares issues and, in particular, the need for greater interchangeability of commuter tickets on bus and rail services, in advance of the introduction of smart card technologies.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by CIE that the revised fare increases which came into effect from 9 December have increased only by an average of 9%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" />The key deterrent to the greater use of public transport by private car owners has been the poor quality of infrastructure, old buses and rolling stock and congestion. Major investment in replacement and additional buses has taken place in recent years and will continue over the lifetime of the national development plan, thus improving capacity, reliability and frequency. The investment in an expanding network of quality bus corridors has also enhanced the role of bus services. Against a background where fares had declined in real terms by more than 20% over the last ten years, I do not believe current fare levels are a deterrent to the use of public transport.</P>

      <P>There are currently three semi-State companies under the aegis of my Department &ndash; Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and CIE. Details of the fees and expenses paid to the chairpersons of each body are as follows:</P>
      <P>For the three years prior to 1 January 2001, the annual fee payable in the case of the chairpersons of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus was &euro;9,523.03 as authorised by the then Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance. With effect from 1 January 2001 the annual fee rate authorised in each case is &euro;19,046.07.</P>
      <P>In addition to the annual fee set out, the chairperson of Aer Lingus is entitled to claim an allowance of &euro;635 per day for each day's attendance in excess of the normal requirement of one day per week. This was agreed in December 2001, from date of appointment, in recognition of the sustained level of commitment required from the chairperson in steering Aer Lingus through its difficulties. This daily allowance operates up to a ceiling of &euro;63,487 per annum.</P>
      <P>As part of the survival plan, the directors of Aer Lingus, including the chairperson, agreed to waive payment of fees from late 2001 to October 2003.</P>
      <P>The current chairperson of CIE was appointed as executive chairperson on 28 March, 2000 on a fee of &euro;101,579.05 per annum based on a three and half day week. However, from 28 March 2000 until 1 October, 2000, the date he ceased to hold office as director general of FÁS, a fee of &euro;9,523.04 per annum was applied pro rata.</P>
      <P>With effect from the 5 June, 2002, the Government approved a fee of &euro;160,000 for the executive chairperson of CIE based on a full working week.</P>

      <P>Under a Eurocontrol (European Organisation for the safety of Air Navigation) Multilateral agreement to which Ireland is a party, various categories of flights, flights under visual flight rules, flights performed by small aircraft, flights performed for the transport of Heads of State and search and rescue flights are exempt from paying en-route charges.</P>
      <P>In the case of other categories, military flights, training flights, flights performed to test air navigation equipment and circular flights, states have the option to exempt such flights from payment of the en-route charge. In common with most Eurocontrol member states, Ireland exempts all such flights, including military, from payment of the en-route charge. Because of this arrangement the IAA costs in relation to military flights are met from my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>A total of &euro;7.025 million, not including VAT has been paid to the IAA since its establishment in 1994 to 2001 in the years 1994 to 2001, inclusive, in relation to all exempted flights other than flights under visual flight rules. While it is not possible to provide an exact breakdown of the remaining total between military and other exempt flights, it is estimated that the latter comprises a very small proportion of the total payment of &euro;7.025 million. In relation to 2002, the equivalent amount invoiced to end September by the IAA is &euro;925,000.</P>

The fact that Amnesty International and the Irish Penal Reform Trust were not facilitated with the proposed racism project, which was a decision taken entirely on its own merits, has no implication for either organisation in their being afforded access to prisons and I reject the suggestion that the decision in this case amounts to exclusion of Amnesty International from visits to Irish prisons or exclusion from any future research or other project involving prisoners.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government decided in September 2001 to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to establish a working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Parallel structures with the same remit have been established in the case of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The operational details of the <Col N="318" /> implementation of the Commission recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group. The position in relation to the issue of parity of pensions for members of An Garda Síochána who retired prior to 1993 is that the Commission examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of An Garda Síochána and others, as part of its deliberations, but, having assessed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved. Having regard to the Commission's report, I have no plans to introduce amending legislation at this stage.</P>

      <P>The teaching staff in the Irish Prison Service are employed by the relevant Vocational Education Committee (VEC) for the area in which each Institution is located. In the case of Shanganagh Castle, the County Dublin VEC is the relevant employer. The Deputy may wish to note that Shanganagh Castle is the only prison institution in that VEC's area of responsibility. I take the opportunity to again pay tribute to the important service that the education service staff in Shanganagh Castle have given to the prison system and in particular to the young offenders that have passed through Shanganagh over the years. I would also emphasise that the decision to close Shanganagh should in no way reflect on the excellent services provided by all the staff of that institution, including the education staff. With regard to the position of the teaching staff currently working in Shanganagh, the Irish Prison Service is engaging in dialogue with the County Dublin VEC regarding the arrangements for these staff. The Irish Prison Service will also support any measures that can be agreed with the relevant VEC that would facilitate any members of the teaching staff in Shan<Col N="319" /> ganagh who wish to continue to work in the prison education service to do so. Finally, the closure of Shanganagh is not a decision that has been taken lightly but it is one aimed at positive reinvestment in the prisons and at maximising the use of resources available to the Prison Service, for the benefit of the offenders who are placed in their care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Shanganagh Castle was opened in 1969 as an open detention centre for males aged between 16 and 21 years of age. The centre, which stands on grounds of 24 acres, has accommodation for 60 inmates in dormitory style accommodation. However, it has been increasingly difficult to identify young male offenders suitable for this type of open prison accommodation. Shanganagh Castle had an average offender occupancy of 30 inmates last year and this has fallen again this year, with only 12 inmates being detained there at present. In addition, the full implementation of the provisions of the Children Act, 2001, will mean that 16 and 17 years old inmates must be completely segregated in the prison system, resulting in a further drop in those offenders who might be found suitable for transfer to Shanganagh Castle.</P>
      <P>In view of the very considerable decline in the number of young offenders found suitable for transfer to Shanganagh Castle in recent years, the Irish Prisons Service established a group to examine the options for its continued use a detention centre. While the report of the group identified an increase in the upper age limit of offenders as one option, it also recognised that: if none of the recommended options was considered viable then, as the current regime at Shanganagh Castle cannot be justified on operational or financial grounds, the closure of the castle and the subsequent disposal of the site will have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the important service that Shanganagh Castle and its staff have given to the prison system, in particular in terms of dealing with juvenile offenders, over the years. However, having carefully considered this report, its current viability and the options available for its future use, it is my intention to close the centre in order to contribute to the control of costs in the prison <Col N="321" /> service, to make more effective use of prison service staffing and other resources and to release funds through the sale of Shanganagh Castle to be used, subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, for other more productive prison-related purposes.</P>
    <P>The closure and sale of Shanganagh Castle is not a decision that I have taken lightly, but it is a decision aimed at positive reinvestment in the prisons and at maximising the use of resources available to the prison service for the benefit of the offenders who are placed in their care.</P>
    <P>The Irish Prisons Service has contacted the Prison Officers' Association, as the representative body concerned, to discuss the arrangements for the deployment of staff from Shanganagh Castle. It is intended that the majority of serving staff will be offered an early transfer to one of the Irish Prisons Service's other institutions where a need arises. Some staff will be retained in Shanganagh Castle to assist in the closure of the institution. All staff will be afforded an opportunity to indicate, in order of preference, the institutions to which they would ultimately prefer to transfer. While this process will inform management of the preferences of staff, unfortunately, it may not be possible to accommodate staff preferences in the shortterm and an assignment elsewhere may be involved. In such cases, staff preferences will continue to receive consideration in the context of existing transfer agreements.</P>
    <P>The small number of inmates currently in Shanganagh Castle can be accommodated elsewhere in the prison system, in particular, in St. Patrick's Institution. This institution, which currently houses offenders in the same age category as Shanganagh Castle, has introduced important new programmes over the past two years for the rehabilitation of offenders, including a positive sentence management programme.</P>
    <P>In addition, a successful drug-free wing with 76 spaces has been in operation in St. Patrick's since November 2000. This wing allows inmates who do not have a background of drug abuse, or those who have demonstrated a desire to stop taking drugs, to be detained in a drug-free and secure environment. I would like to bring to the Deputy's attention that a study conducted by the Euro<Col N="322" /> pean conference on drugs and HIV-AIDS services in prisons indicated that St. Patrick's Institution was an example of best practice in the area of drug policy in establishments of its type.</P>

      <P>A visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925, and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925. There are currently 16 such committees. I am satisfied with the composition of the visiting committees. There are no specific criteria used in selecting individuals for appointment. The composition of each committee is drawn from as wide a spectrum as possible to ensure that the needs of prisoners are understood and met. This is the long standing practice used by successive Ministers in appointing members to the prisons visiting committees. The function of visiting committees is to visit at frequent intervals the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee have free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities. The committees also submit annual reports to me which are subsequently published.</P>
      <P>A table of all the visiting committees setting out the county in which the individual member resides follows for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 398 and 399 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the liquor licensing commission was established in November 2000 with a two year lifespan and its remit is to review the liquor licensing system and make recommendations for a system geared to meet the needs of consumers in a competitive marketing environment, while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society.</P>
      <P>In March 2002, the Government extended the commission's terms of reference to include the following: &ldquo;To examine the rights of licence holders to refuse admission and service in licensed premises and to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The commission has been meeting regularly over the past two years &ndash; 19 plenary meetings and numerous meetings of sub-committees &ndash; and to date has submitted three reports. The commission has established sub-committees as the need arises, to review particular subject areas, including access to licences in urban and suburban centres of population, hours of trading, licences for night-clubs and theatres etc., and, a subject of particular concern to us all, issues relating to alcohol consumption by young persons. I understand that a total of 13 sub-committees has been established to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the commission was originally requested to submit its final report within two <Col N="330" /> years of its first meeting, i.e. by mid-December 2002, the Government recently decided to extend this deadline to mid-March 2003, because of the additional work arising in relation to the new term of reference. In the circumstances, I wish to strongly refute any suggestion that reform of the licensing laws is being in any way delayed by the Commission on Liquor Licensing.</P>

    <P>In addition, my Department's equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-2006, under the NDP, gives particular priority to proposals located in disadvantaged areas. A number of projects, located in RAPID areas, have been funded under the equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-2006. I have been informed that records for the programme are maintained on a county basis. Consequently, a full list of projects in the 25 urban centres and 20 provincial towns under RAPID would take some time to prepare. I will make the list of projects and the amounts awarded under the EOCP in the RAPID areas available to the Deputy shortly.</P>

      <P>In accordance with <Col N="332" /> the polluter pays principle, environmental levies and other fiscal and market based instruments are being increasingly used internationally to assist in the achievement of environmental objectives. The OECD recently published a comparative study, Environmentally Related Taxes in OECD Countries: Issues and Strategies, which is of relevance in this regard.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, there has already been some experience and success with economic and fiscal instruments, for example, differentiated taxation in favour of unleaded petrol and the more recent levies on plastic bags and the landfilling of waste. The Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001 provides that further levies may be applied to other goods and articles, subject to confirmation by the Oireachtas, and the Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to consider extending the use of levies. In addition, as indicated by the Minister for Finance in his recent budget speech, relevant Departments have been asked to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Fiscal measures, incentives and disincentives and other economic instruments that have been applied internationally can often offer useful models of best practice, while acknowledging the unique circumstances involved in any particular instance. Relevant developments in this area are monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department and are taken into account in the formulation and review of environmental policy.</P>

      <P>Under part M of the national building regulations, persons constructing new buildings or extending existing buildings to which the public have access, on or after 1 June 1992, are obliged to provide access for people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" />The provision of disabled access facilities to other existing buildings is a matter for the owners and occupiers of the buildings concerned. Departments and local authorities have been requested by my Department, on a number of occasions, to ensure that appropriate provision is made for access facilities for people with disabilities to all buildings under their control. Recognising that 2003 will be the European Year of the Disabled, I am arranging for my Department to renew this request early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Amendments to part M came into effect on 1 January 2001 and require all new dwellings to be visitable by people with disabilities. The amended regulations also place a more stringent requirement regarding disabled access on new or extended non-residential buildings, including places of employment and leisure, hotels and cinemas. Such access will now have to be &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;, not just &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. Compliance with the building regulations is primarily a matter for the owners, designers and builders of the buildings involved. My Department has published updated Technical Guidance Document M (2000 edition) on how to comply with the requirements of the amended part M. A copy of this publication has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Local building control authorities are responsible for monitoring and enforcement of compliance with the regulations. The authorities are empowered to inspect public buildings, issue enforcement notices for non-compliance with the regulations and initiate court proceedings. The national enforcement target is that authorities would physically inspect at least 12% to 15% of developments in their functional areas.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, my Department has urged local authorities to more actively enforce all parts of the building regulations, including part M. In particular, Circular Letters BC 7/99 of 17 June 1999, and BC 7/2002 of 12 February 2002, specifically called for stricter enforcement of part M. The appointment of building control officers has been sanctioned where necessary and building control fees were increased to fund stricter local enforcement. At present, more than 90% of authorities are carrying out inspections; over 80% of authorities have achieved the target level of inspection, 12%-15% of developments; and the remaining authorities have been requested to achieve the agreed target.</P>

      <P>County and development boards have been established in each county and city area to bring about the more integrated delivery of public and local development services at local level. The CDBs, which have recently published their agreed county or city strategies for economic, social and cultural development, are representative of local government, local development bodies, together with the State agencies and the social partners operating locally. Local government is represented on the boards by the local authority's corporate policy group and the county or city manager.</P>

    <P>Implementation of the boards' strategies is the responsibility of their member agencies. The <Col N="335" /> CDBs themselves are not executive bodies and do not therefore have a staffing complement of their own. The boards are, however, supported by staff from the community and enterprise section of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Restrictions on the employment of councillors by local authorities are contained in section 21 of the Local Government Act, 1955. These restrictions are modified by the Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Act, 1974 (Section 25) Order, 1974. Under these provisions, a councillor is prohibited from being employed except in the lower level grades by the local authority of which he is a member or by an adjoining local authority.</P>

      <P>There is no proposal at present to put the homeless action plans on a statutory basis. Most of these action plans have now been completed and they provide a clear framework for the planning and delivery of support and services to the homeless. The remaining few plans are in the process of being finalised by local authorities and health boards and should be adopted shortly. The priority at this stage is to ensure implementation of the current homeless action plans and my Department is actively pursuing this with local authorities.</P>
      <P>The need to improve data on homelessness is recognised. In Dublin, the Homeless Agency, with the support of my Department, is currently piloting the LINK system with a number of service providers. This system tracks each individual person presenting as homeless to any of these services and this will allow a profile of people using homeless services to be built up. It is intended that the system will be extended to all homeless services in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Similar improvements to data collection and analysis on homelessness are being considered in other local authority areas where there are a significant number of homeless persons. The issue of improved data collection generally is also being addressed at local authority level as part of the development of an integrated IT package for housing for all local authorities.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the regular flooding of roads throughout the country and particularly in the Dublin area; if this is due to bad road design or the lack of drains; and if the drains, in some cases maintained by private companies, are being properly maintained.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25498/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent flooding in <Col N="341" /> the Dublin area occurred in the context of near record rainfall for the month of November, a precipitation of some 75mm fell on Thursday, 14 November and the particular impact that this rainfall had on the Tolka catchment. The scale of flooding was unprecedented and in the River Tolka catchment was the worst since records began in 1898, exceeding in severity two other major flooding incidents in 1954 and 2000. In addition, rainfall in October was also well above normal. There was, therefore, exceptional rainfall for six weeks which amounted to over three times the average rainfall for the period. The level of rainfall on 14 November 2002 significantly exceeded normal average rainfall for the entire month of November and the result of the prolonged heavy rainfall was that the ground was already heavily saturated.</P>
      <P>My Department's water services investment programme, 2002-04 includes the Dublin region strategic drainage study. The study is a largescale project with an estimated cost of &euro;11.4 million. It commenced in 2001 and is due for completion in mid-2003. The River Tolka has been included as one of the rivers to be modelled in detail as well as its key tributaries. Data for the Tolka has been collected and the computer model is being constructed. When finished it will be used to assess the causes of recent flooding and to formulate options to address these problems.</P>
      <P>This study is likely to make recommendations relating to both the provision of infrastructure and river/flood control measures. It will then be a matter for implementing bodies such as the local authorities concerned and the Office of Public Works to develop detailed implementation programmes for the projects which fall within their remit.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I understand Dublin City Council has asked the consultants undertaking the River Tolka flood study to produce an interim assessment of any short-term flood protection measures, and their costs, which might be possible in advance of the completion of the main report. Fingal and Meath County Councils have sought similar interim assessments.</P>
      <P>On 27 November 2002, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works announced a review of national flooding policy. This will be carried out by a group representing the major stakeholders, i.e., Office of Public Works, Department of Finance, Department of the Environment and Local Government, local authorities and representatives of farming organisations. The review will, <i>inter alia</i>, (a) draw up proposals to indicate how the State should respond to different categories of flooding and recommend which agencies should have responsibility in each case, (b) report on the causes and extent of flooding, and (c) identify strategies to prevent any increase in the present extent of areas at risk of flooding, with particular reference to current predictions regarding the effects of climate change.</P>

    <P>Generally, the position in relation to non-national roads is that their maintenance and <Col N="342" /> improvement is a matter for individual local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented from State grants provided by my Department. The initial selection and prioritisation of works under the various non-national road grant categories is also a matter for individual local authorities, including the carrying out of weather related works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The water framework directive is a complex directive requiring the co-ordination of a wide range of actions by authorities with functions in relation to water management. The implementation of the directive is being promoted and co-ordinated at national level by a co-ordination group of officials of Departments and other authorities involved in water management. In addition to co-ordination at national level, officials of my Department and other authorities are participating in working groups, research projects and other initiatives to promote consistent and co-ordinated implementation of the WFD at regional level, on a North-South basis, in the UK generally and in the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is promoting, in particular, the establishment by local authorities of regional projects to develop river basin monitoring and management systems and to provide the bulk of the baseline data required for implementation of the directive and for development of river basin management plans. Two such projects have already been fully approved in relation to the South-eastern region and the Shannon river basin and are being funded by my Department. Major projects have also been approved in principle for the <Col N="343" /> establishment of river basin management projects in relation to the western region and the eastern region and proposals for both of these projects are currently under consideration by my Department. A proposal for the south-west region is expected in the near future. A website is being developed by my Department to facilitate public access to information on the implementation of the directive and measures are being taken to promote and facilitate participation in such implementation by all interested persons.</P>
    <P>The directive lays down a timetable for full implementation by 2015 on a phased basis with a series of intermediate deadlines. The first deadline occurs in December 2003 and requires the identification of river basins, river basin districts and the competent authorities in each RBD as well as the transposition of the directive into national law. It is likely that some seven RBDs will be established to cover all areas, including cross-Border river basins, and discussions are at an advanced stage with authorities in Northern Ireland in this regard. A second implementation deadline occurs in December 2004 and requires the &ldquo;characterisation&rdquo; of water resources to indicate, <i>inter alia,</i> the location and boundaries of all water bodies and to identify those which are used as sources of drinking water. This process will be assisted by the national water study undertaken by my Department and completed in 2000, which involved a comprehensive national audit of public water supplies serving more than 5,000 consumers. It will also be assisted by the review of the greater Dublin strategic water study, also concluded in 2000, and by the extensive work currently under way under the rural water programme in relation to group water schemes.</P>

      <P>Strong and visible enforcement is critical to ensuring that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. The changes in the 2000 Act are designed to encourage increased enforcement and more compliance by developers. I intend to keep performance by planning authorities in this area under review.</P>
      <P>However, direct responsibility for ensuring compliance with planning permissions in individual cases is a matter for the relevant planning authority. The legislation has not therefore assigned powers to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to enforce planning permissions or conditions or to direct authorities to take action in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" />Section 255 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 enables the Minister to direct planning authorities to review their organisation, systems and procedures. Where the Minister forms the opinion that a planning authority may not be carrying out its functions in accordance with the Act, the Minister may appoint a commissioner to carry out these functions.</P>

The overall finding was that of the order of one in three housing completions in Ireland was in respect of single houses in rural areas as defined above.</P>

      <P>From 1998, the Department of Agriculture and Food and Dúchas, the Heritage Service, now part of my Department, have been jointly involved in the preparation of commonage framework plans and negotiations thereon.</P>
      <P>In 1998 it was agreed, in consultation with the EU Commission, that immediate action had to be taken to deal with overgrazing on commonages. A programme of work commenced to prepare framework plans prescribing stocking levels for every commonage in the country. An interim framework plan, with a compulsory requirement of 30% destocking on commonages in six western counties, was introduced at the end of 1998. As the Deputy will be aware the interim framework plan is now being replaced by the stocking level requirements of individual commonage framework plans.</P>

Issues such as the allocation of tenancies in these projects are a matter for the approved housing body and the relevant local authority to determine.</P>
      <P>In projects provided under the capital assistance scheme a minimum of three quarters of the units are let to households who are qualified for local authority housing, homeless persons, persons surrendering local authority houses or elderly emigrants returning from abroad. The remaining units may be let to households in need of accommodation nominated by the approved housing body, irrespective of their other circumstances. Where accommodation is provided under the capital loan subsidy scheme the units must be let to households who are qualified for local authority housing in order to qualify for maximum funding available under the scheme. Local authority decisions in regard to the letting of individual dwellings by an approved body are, in common with the letting of local authority dwellings, exercisable as an executive function under the responsibility of the manager.</P>

      <P>The RAPID programme is a focused initiative to frontload and prioritise investment already indicated under the national development plan in the most disadvantaged areas in the country, 45 areas have been included in the programme. Strand one of RAPID relates to 25 urban areas and strand two to 20 provincial towns.</P>
      <P>There are a number of measures in place in my Department to support the programme, including the funding of the local co-ordinators for each RAPID area, managing the co-ordination of the programme across the Department and ongoing consultation with senior management in the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining projects under both strands of the programme which have been received from the local area implementation teams. The proposals for strand one mainly relate to social housing, local road improvement measures and environmental issues which are delivered on the ground by local authorities. The nature and scale of many of these projects, some of which are subject to detailed design and will require phased implementation, has necessitated extensive evaluation as well as consultation with local authorities and the Area Development Management Limited RAPID support team. This evaluation and consultation process is ongoing with a view to progressing matters in so far as possible, in the context of the estimates provisions for 2003 and onwards. In the circumstances, the information as sought in the question would be premature for the generality of projects at this stage. However, approval in principle has been given to the funding of a limited number of projects which are in a position to proceed; details, as available, are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Plans for strand two areas i.e. provincial towns have just been received in my Department and are currently being examined. In addition to RAPID projects, public agencies, including local authorities, are already providing a wide range of services in all RAPID areas. A fund of &euro;22.2 million has been provided for the CLÁR programme for the period 2002-03. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is solely responsible for determining which schemes and projects qualify for CLÁR assistance. My Department provides co-funding for certain CLÁR projects in areas such as small public water and sewerage schemes, group schemes and non-national roads.</P>

      <P>My Department published guidelines for planning authorities on wind farm development in September 1996. The guidelines (a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library) identify relevant planning and land use issues which planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard in formulating development plans and considering a planning application or appeal in relation to a wind farm.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Chesterfield Avenue was not originally constructed to deal with such intense traffic volumes as exist at present and as a result it now needs both major repair works to the foundations and surface of the road itself and the introduction of design features with a view to increasing safety and reducing the speed of traffic.</P>
      <P>A fully integrated plan for the renovation of Chesterfield Avenue has accordingly been prepared by my Department, and it is intended to submit the scheme for planning approval early in the new year. The safety of all park users has been paramount in the preparation of this plan, which has been developed in consultation with the Dublin Transportation Office, and will involve a variety of traffic calming measures, which are, at the same time, appropriate to the context of this national historic park.</P>
      <P>It is intended to implement the project on a phased basis and to minimise disruption to park users. My Department's first priority would be the construction of a roundabout at Mountjoy Cross and the introduction of traffic calming in the vicinity of Dublin Zoo.</P>
      <P>In relation to Ashtown Gate, my Department considers the provision of traffic lights is not an appropriate solution in the context of a national historic park and that either the provision of a roundabout or a one-way system would be better solutions. My Department is awaiting a final response to these recommendations from Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has responsibility for overseeing the work of the local drugs task forces, LDTFs, which are based in 14 areas of high drug misuse in Dublin including Tallaght, Cork and Bray.</P>
      <P>The LDTFs are made up of representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors and each area develops a local action plan. The selection of projects is based on the task force's prioritisation of the identified needs within its area and the ability of the proposed projects to meet those needs. Most of the LDTFs are currently implementing their second round plans and, to date, more than &euro;14 million has been allocated to implement these plans. In this context, all of the LDTFs have recognised the need for family support projects and included such projects within their plans.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to distinguish with certainty the total allocations made to family support actions in the LDTF plans as some projects adopt a multi-faceted approach and include a number of elements. However, I am in a position to provide the Deputy with a list of the projects identified by the national drug strategy team as being family support-oriented. The list is attached herewith. The number of people assisted by these groups is not available.</P>

The letters also afforded the parents, by means of a reply slip, the opportunity to rectify any incorrect information held by my Department to eliminate the risk of any problems in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case in question a letter issued which listed the original birth surname of an adopted child. Investigation of this matter within my Department has confirmed that in 1991 the parents advised my Department in connection with a claim on behalf of one of the parents of the change in the child's surname. However, this information was not updated to the Department's central records system or notified to the child benefit area. I can confirm that checks are being put in place within my Department to ensure that this situation does not occur again. I regret the distress caused to the family through this error. I wish to advise that my Department has been in <Col N="358" /> direct contact with the adoptive parents and that the incorrect data has now been fully corrected on my Department's databases and an apology given.</P>

      <Quest>if an unemployment benefit appeal by a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will be reopened considering that the person is continuing to actively look for work; when her Department will return the refusal letters from prospective employers to this person as promised; and the reason this person is being denied unemployment benefit considering they are actively and continuing seeking work.</Quest>

      <P>The continued entitlement to unemployment benefit of the person concerned was reviewed on 21 May 2002 when she was requested to provide details of her efforts to find full-time employment. In the light of the details provided, the deciding officer concluded that she had failed to show that she was genuinely seeking full-time work and disallowed her claim accordingly from 6 June 2002.</P>
      <P>She appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office in July 2002 and an oral hearing of her appeal was held on 8 October 2002. Having considered all of the available evidence, including that adduced at the oral hearing, the appeals officer was not satisfied that the person was genuinely seeking full-time employment and disallowed her appeal. The person was notified of the decision of the appeals officer on 18 October 2002. It is open to the person to submit new evidence to the appeals officer for consideration.</P>
      <P>The letters which were submitted by the person in response to the Department's request for evidence that she was seeking full-time employment will be returned to her shortly. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <Quest>when a person (details supplied) in County Mayo will receive child benefit for their child considering that they submitted the form from the college in September 2002; the reason this person did not receive child benefit payment for another child for October and November on returning the book to her Department as instructed; if she will investigate the fact that this person tried on several occasions to telephone the child benefit section with no success and without being able to speak with anybody in that section; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>When the person concerned applied for extended benefit for one of her children and returned the benefit book for a change in the office of payment, the benefit was not in payment to her and it was necessary to confirm her entitlement before payment could be re-issued. This matter has now been resolved and a replacement book is in the course of issue. The payment book contains arrears of &euro;705.60 for the period July to November 2002 and payment of &euro;235.20 a month from December 2002. She will be informed when it is available for collection.</P>
      <P>I regret that the person concerned has experienced difficulty in contacting the relevant office of my Department. There are particular difficulties in processing claims for child benefit at present but every effort is being made to restore service to normal levels as quickly as possible.</P>
