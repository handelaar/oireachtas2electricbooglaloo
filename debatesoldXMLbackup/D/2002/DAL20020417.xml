      <P>I wish to formally announce, for the information of the Dáil, that I accepted the resignation of Deputy Robert Molloy as Minister of State to the Government and as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with special responsibility for housing and urban renewal on Wednesday, 10 April 2002. On Thursday, 11 April 2002, I appointed Deputy Liz O'Donnell to be Minister of State to the Government in addition to her existing assignment as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for overseas development assistance and human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies will know, this issue was discussed in considerable detail in the House on 1 May and 14 November last year. For their benefit, I would again like to put the position on the record.</P>
      <P>On 8 January 1998 the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, announced that he had asked officials to examine &ldquo;how best to encourage and facilitate an understanding of the Battle of the Boyne and an appreciation of the environment in which it took place.&rdquo; Subsequently, an interdepartmental committee, made up of representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Taoiseach, Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Environment and Local Government, as well as the Office of Public Works and Bord Fáilte, was established and held its first meeting on 12 March 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mandate of the committee was to examine how best to develop the historic Battle of the Boyne site. The committee, which is chaired by a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been meeting on a regular basis since it was established. Very importantly, from an early date the archivist of the Orange Order participated fully in meetings of the committee and <Col N="3" /> the order has expressed its appreciation for the commitment of resources by the Government for the purchase of the Oldbridge estate and for the effort being devoted to its planning and development.</P>
    <P>The condition of the site had been a concern for some time to the Unionist and Protestant people and organisations in Northern Ireland, for whom the battle has a particular significance. In the context of consolidation of peace and reconciliation, and as a cultural heritage and tourism project in its own right, and having become aware that the owners of the Oldbridge estate were interested in selling the property, the Office of Public Works was asked to explore the possible acquisition of part or all of the estate with a view to providing greatly improved visitor facilities.</P>
    <P>The estate forms a substantial part of the battle site &ndash; the Orange Order has subsequently confirmed its view that the estate encompasses the central portion of the battlefield where the major action took place and where most of the casualties occurred &ndash; and it was offered to the State on commercial terms. A number of site visits were made to the estate, including by the Minister of State with responsibility for public works, Deputy Cullen, the chairman of the Office of Public Works and members of my office.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement placed a formal commitment on the Government &ldquo;to continue to take further steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland&rdquo;. It was against this background, therefore, and immediately after the establishment of the institutions on 2 December 1999, that on 5 December 1999 I announced that the Government had agreed in principle to purchase the site of the Battle of the Boyne.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House previously, the Office of Public Works negotiated the purchase of the Oldbridge estate for £7.85 million, a valuation which it considered fair, and funding for the purchase came from the Exchequer through the Vote for the Office of Public Works, following sanction by the Department of Finance. Neither I nor my officials played any part in the negotiations on the purchase of the site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised here on previous occasions. Unless people have forgotten the details, a private company, Deep River Limited, purchased the site for £2 million in 1997. Two years later, it sold it on to the State for £7.85 million. This resulted in a profit of £5 million being made in a two year period. A close associate of the Taoiseach, Mr. Tim Collins, was involved. It transpires from material released under the Freedom of Information Act that the Government was divided on the purchase and that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, who has responsibility for heritage sites, was opposed to it. Will the Taoiseach explain how he considered this to be a justifiable purchase when the Minister responsible was <Col N="4" /> opposed to it, one of his close associates was involved in it and the profit from it was twice the purchase price within a two year period? Were any other of his associates involved in the purchase? Will he again inform the House whether he was personally involved in making representations to have the site purchased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply again. It did transpire that an associate of mine had been involved, unknown to me, as part of the McCann family group which was involved in the purchase and sale of the site. I have put this on the record previously. I was not involved in making representations for the site to be purchased. The suggestion originated within the public service at the behest of the Department of Foreign Affairs following representations it had received on numerous occasions, in particular during the period of the multi-party talks in 1997 and 1998.</P>
      <P>The figures the Deputy quoted from the records are correct. It is not correct, however, that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, was in any way opposed to the site. Dúchas, the Minister and her officials were totally in favour of the purchase of the site. However, as revealed in the material requested under the Freedom of Information Act, her Department did not have the resources and was concerned, therefore, to make sure that the resources were not taken from its budget. Of course, this did not happen. The Minister was totally in favour of the entire project as was every other member of the Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear again that the idea for this project originated in the public service and has been pursued at all times solely on the basis of its national importance. The Government for its part was motivated solely by the desire to contribute to peace, reconciliation and better understanding between the different traditions on the island and to recognise the importance of the Battle of the Boyne site from an historical and heritage point of view. From the beginning, the project had the strong support of the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who brought it to Government.</P>
      <P>In addition, my suggestion in relation to the inclusion of the development of the Battle of the Boyne site in the National Millennium Committee, which has been raised here before, was grounded on the need to recognise cultural diversity in this jurisdiction as part of our commitment under the Agreement and to take further steps to promote and demonstrate a respect for the different traditions on this island. I outlined this in a speech in May 1998, shortly after the signing of the Agreement, entitled &ldquo;The Good Friday Agreement and Cultural Diversity&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the purchase of this site was being discussed internally in Departments long before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement? Could he explain why the site was not purchased from the original ven<Col N="5" /> dors and the reason a private consortium, River Deep Limited, was allowed to acquire it in the first instance and sell it on to the State at a profit of £5 million? Will he indicate whether Mr. Paddy Duffy was part of the consortium or was hired as a consultant by Mr. Tim Collins in connection with this transaction? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Mr. Paddy Duffy, who worked in my Department until the summer of 1999, was not part of the consortium, nor was he part of the McCann group which was involved in the site. The official of my office who dealt with the matter was my adviser who worked on North-South matters and was deeply involved in the project throughout.</P>
      <P>It is totally incorrect to state that the purchase of the site was being discussed in 1997. The first statement by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, was on 8 January 1998 and is on the public record. It was issued in response to requests made by Archbishop Eames and others, but mainly Archbishop Eames, which raised the state of the site and asked the Government, as part of its focus on the creation of a lasting peace, to endeavour to use the site for the purposes of reconciliation and mutual understanding. Messines was the other site in which we were asked to take an active interest, which we did. That was followed by the setting up of an interdepartmental group. It was only during the discussions of the interdepartmental group at the end of 1998 that it was made known by the then owners that they had an interest in selling it. At the time public statements were made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others that the site should be preserved and used as an instrument to help the political settlement.</P>
      <P>It was not done prior to the Good Friday Agreement. The statement was made on 8 January 1998 and the interdepartmental group was set up in March 1998, but it was towards the end of 1998 before any move happened. It was the end of 1999 before the Government made a decision after the signing of the agreement, which was two years later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the transaction is being investigated by the Flood tribunal. Has the Government been requested to forward all documents in respect of this transaction and, if so, has it done so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. In February 2001 the Secretary General of my Department instructed the head of corporate affairs to bring together at the earliest possible date all the files and other documentation related in any way to this project and to forward them immediately to the tribunal. That has been done. Statements by my staff, who were involved in any of the site visits, and by the Secretary General of my Department, who instigated the project when he played another role in the Department of Foreign Affairs, are also included.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>April 10 marked the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and, four years on, the Agreement is helping achieve a new beginning and fresh start in Northern Ireland and in relations between all the peoples on these islands. The committed, positive working <Col N="7" /> relationships between the two Governments and all the pro-Agreement parties have helped us manage the difficult issues which have arisen. The recent meeting of the Governments and the pro-Agreement parties in Belfast was a timely opportunity to look at the implementation of the Agreement. It was a welcome reminder of our common purpose and common determination to continue in our work together and an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made.</P>
    <P>What we achieved four years ago is the framework for fairness and equality needed for a peaceful and stable Northern Ireland and for positive and normal relations between all the peoples of these islands. Partnership Government is now in place in Belfast. The North-South and east-west institutions are functioning effectively. Northern Ireland is being demilitarised. Substantial decommissioning has taken place and the new start to policing is under way. Partnership, equality and mutual respect are being progressively strengthened. With lasting peace and stabilising political institutions, the economic dividend for Northern Ireland will continue to develop and grow. The promise of the Agreement is being fulfilled. There are continuing challenges, but our commitment to the Agreement and our determination to see it fully implemented remain undiminished.</P>
    <P>The announcement on 8 April by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning that the IRA had put a varied and substantial quantity of ammunition, arms and explosive material beyond use represented a further important step in the resolution of the arms issue and I warmly welcomed it. This development provides reassurance that the issue of arms is being, and can be, resolved under the auspices of the commission in a satisfactory way. The goal of putting all paramilitary arms beyond use is achievable, although this will also require loyalist paramilitary groups to engage positively with the commission. I express my sincere gratitude to General John de Chastelain and his colleagues for advancing this indispensable part of the Agreement in a professional, painstaking and productive manner. I know the issue of decommissioning is an extremely difficult one for the republican movement. However, the announcement by the commission is further evidence that they realise it must be pursued if confidence, trust and genuine partnership are to be maintained and strengthened.</P>
    <P>It is time for those on all sides who have doubted the benefits of the Agreement to recognise the profoundly important progress that has been made. It should be clear at this stage that the Agreement is not a threat to anybody, but a real opportunity to ensure that Northern Ireland has a future that is good and fair for all. The Agreement is widely recognised not just in Ireland, but in a broader international context, as a creative and progressive model in addressing deep seated political divisions. We have only to <Col N="8" /> witness the turmoil in the Middle East to appreciate the true value of what we have so painstakingly achieved.</P>
    <P>As regards implementation of the package of proposals agreed at Weston Park, progress continues to be made across the range of issues, including the operation of the institutions, demilitarisation and policing. The proposal to appoint a judge of international standing to investigate cases of concern is the subject of ongoing contact between both Governments. It is hoped that it will be possible to make an appointment in April, as agreed at Weston Park.</P>
    <P>I will meet with the President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, later today. A meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council is scheduled for early next month. I have no current plans to meet with Prime Minister Blair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell the House exactly what the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported to him in terms of the circumstances and quantities of arms put beyond use by the Provisional IRA on the last occasion of decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report contained the information that has been circulated. The commission did not give more details but it indicated that it witnessed the event in which the IRA leadership put a varied and substantial quantity of ammunition, arms and explosive material beyond use. That was done in accordance with the Governments' general scheme of regulations. The commission also confirmed that it has made an inventory of the arms concerned, which will be provided at the end of its task and not on an individual basis. The commission also stated that it has agreed to the IRA condition of confidentiality regarding details of the event as provided in the scheme of regulations and that it will continue its discussions with the IRA representative within the International Independent Commission on Decommissioning's scheme, in the pursuit of its remit. The commission stated that it has continued to have discussions with the loyalist paramilitary groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach put a completion date on decommissioning and indicate if any progress is being made on the decommissioning of loyalist paramilitary weapons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The second question is easy to answer as no progress whatsoever is being made. There does not seem to be real engagement or evidence of that and I do not see it arising for a considerable time. It is not on the horizon from what I pick up from security sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original date for completion of decommissioning has been extended. The International Independent Commission on Decommissioning does not want to stay an undue length. It is prepared to see it out for a period of time but I know that General de Chastelain has been putting <Col N="9" /> pressure on for some time to move this on to completion, and there are other colleagues involved in that also. While there is no date, there is a determination that this will not drift on into election time in the North next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the various meetings the Taoiseach has had with Mr. Adams, and the meetings that the British Prime Minister has had with Mr. Adams and leaders of the republican movement, has linkage been sought by the leaders of Sinn Féin between further acts of decommissioning and progress with respect to the OTRs &ndash; those on the run from prosecutions or being sought by the security authorities and the prosecution processes in both jurisdictions? Are any of the people who have been identified as OTRs by the Sinn Féin republican leadership being sought in this jurisdiction? If so, how many are involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are well in excess of 100 people involved in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that in total?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, collectively in total. That figure has increased. When everything is taken into account I believe the figure will not be 200, but nearer to that than to 150. That is the information that I have received. Administratively, regarding what is happening now and the various processes of the United Kingdom's policing arrangements, the UK will be able to deal with a large number of those cases and be able to clear a large number &ndash; perhaps two thirds &ndash; of those cases.</P>
      <P>There would be a substantial number, perhaps 50 or 60, that could not be dealt with under that arrangement and that is what is creating difficulty. It might require a new system but there would be great difficulties with a legislative system. We all are aware of the views of parties in the House of Commons on that issue. The idea of legislating for an amnesty does not seem to be favoured. They are looking at other systems and other ways of dealing with those remaining cases but that is not yet finalised. It is not yet clear if it is possible to bring forward a proposal but the British Government is endeavouring to do that.</P>
      <P>I do not have information on the number of people who are wanted in this jurisdiction but I could check that. There would not be many because most of these people went from Northern Ireland to foreign jurisdictions and many of them are back now for a considerable time. It is possible that some of them went via this jurisdiction or could have been involved in activities here. I do not have that figure. I am not sure if we have the full list although we would be aware of some names on the list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach inadvertently omitted to answer the question I asked. Has there been any linkage negotiated or put forward by the Sinn Féin leadership in relation to the two issues?</P>

      <P>The OTR issue was not part of the Good Friday Agreement. There is not any direct linkage between policing, demilitarisation or the other ongoing issues, but people raise all of these issues in the ongoing discussions to try to complete them. On the OTR issue, the British Government is trying to find a resolution and, although we are on the sidelines on this, we continually raise the issue of the other people, those who&mdash;</P>

The issues of decommissioning, demilitarisation, policing, the OTRs and those that have vanished are all raised during negotiations as outstanding issues on which progress is sought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I clarify with the Taoiseach that I am correct in interpreting his reply to mean that neither Mr. McGuinness nor Mr. Adams sought to link further progress on decommissioning by the Provisional IRA with progress on the OTRs?</P>
      <P>Second, are any of the OTRs being sought by the UK authorities known to be living in this jurisdiction? Are any of the people connected with the murder of Garda Jerry McCabe being sought by the Irish security authorities and, if so, are they included by the republican leadership as being part of the OTRs?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first question as to whether the Sinn Féin or republican leadership raised the OTR issues in the context of decommissioning is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. All the items were taken separately and they had not endeavoured to get a linkage. There would be people on the OTR list and some prominent people who had not been able to return to Northern Ireland that would live either permanently or semi-permanently in this jurisdiction but they are not people who are wanted by our authorities. Some of them might have had convictions in the past or had dealings with the authorities but they are not currently wanted; they are Sinn Féin people. From the British position in their administrative checking of the people there is no liaison with our authorities on these people; they are checking cases within their own system. There is always co-operation if there is any uncertainty about individual cases. Most of the people on the list now are people long gone from these islands or people who would be around and prominent enough and who would be seeking to get their position here.</P>

      <P>There are a number of separate issues related to the questions asked. The Weston Park agreement of last year gave an undertaking that no later than April of this year an eminent international judge would be appointed to investigate the circumstances in which a number of people were murdered or killed in Northern Ireland and south of the Border. Can the Taoiseach report progress on whether he and the British Prime Minister have identified and agreed on a person of such eminence who would be prepared to serve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there has been progress. It is the subject of continuing contact between the two Governments with a view to getting an agreed candidate and getting that person to give the necessary time commitment. At the Weston Park talks, both Governments accepted that certain cases from the past remain a source of grave public concern, particularly those giving rise to serious allegations of collusion by the security forces. We gave a commitment that the investigation of each case would happen no later than April and a senior judge would be appointed if no prosecutions had taken place by then. We also gave a commitment that in the event that a public inquiry is recommended in any case, the relevant Government would implement the recommendations. We will succeed in making that appointment. An individual has been identified and officials representing both Governments will meet that person shortly.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement required us to set up a Human Rights Commission with a remit equivalent to that of the commission established in Northern Ireland.

      <P>I do not know how many meetings have been held, but both human rights groups, North and South, have been exchanging <Col N="12" /> information. They have both been building up their structures and are co-operating. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for this, I can get a briefing note for the House on it. It is many months since I dealt with this issue and at that time they were communicating, working and exchanging information on cases and case practice of relevance to both North and South. That was the intention and in the absence of this issue being raised with me, I understand that to be the case. However, I will check and send a note to Deputies Noonan and Quinn.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement seems to be working very well in Stormont, with the bedding down of the political institutions and the North-South bodies. What measures are being put in place by both Governments to encourage more inter-community co-operation in Northern Ireland? Some commentators have said that the Agreement is working very well in Stormont but not in the Ardoyne and other areas. What measures are being put in place to encourage more cross-Border contact and co-operation between community groups North and South?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important aspect of the Agreement and will continue to be so in the future. When this matter is discussed with any of the groups involved we always tend to look at the difficult cases, but I appreciate the amount of community involvement that currently takes place. If one takes the 3,000 marches that will occur during the marching season, which has already commenced, it really comes down to a dozen areas of conflict. Good community relationships are going on and there is understanding between many communities. As the Deputy identified, however, there are a number of difficult flashpoints where the Ireland Fund, INTERREG and a number of charitable and religious groups are all working to build up confidence. The political parties in north Belfast are also working to stabilise the situation following a difficult period, particularly last year. An excellent economic report has been produced and parts of Belfast are working to the future by building up community involvement. The same has happened in Portadown. People from the South have made efforts to assist them and that is much appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some of these areas &ndash; this is the kernel of Deputy Deenihan's point &ndash; there is enormous alienation and exclusion from just about everything. Little progress has been made and we have made that point time and time again to the British Government which is listening and has taken the matter on board. In some of these areas one needs the benefit of the equivalent of the European Social Fund, which has been of benefit to areas here in providing skills training. The fund has provided hope in certain communities and without such a provision young people become involved in paramilitary groups or other criminal <Col N="13" /> activities. More effort is needed to build up confidence in such communities. While I do not wish to take from the efforts of the many people I have met from Northern Ireland who are involved in community work, they have a hard task in trying to build up confidence compared to their counterparts in other countries. Voluntary and statutory organisations, such as FÁS and the chambers of commerce, have put much time and effort into such work, although it is a slow process.</P>
    <P>There are still flashpoints such as north Belfast, the Lower Ormeau Road and Portadown but, having said that, I give credit to the hundreds of other areas that are managing to make progress. Some of these difficulties will take years to work out because in some of the areas there is no intercommunal contact. It is still a tactic to go down to the end of the street on a Saturday night to throw stones and rocks. It is still the practice for a small number of people to engage in such agitation. It will take time to build up relationships in those areas because, unfortunately, those types of events are still happening, particularly during the summer.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is committed to reviewing the Offences Against the State Acts. Tomorrow, the Government will ask the Dáil to renew certain sections of the 1998 Act, yet we have heard virtually nothing of the review. What can the Taoiseach tell us about the review at this point? What is the current status of the review, which is one of the critical commitments the Government made? The Government also committed itself to establishing a human rights commission. Does the Taoiseach agree it is unacceptable that while the commission in the Six Counties has been up and running for some time, the commission in this jurisdiction has not yet been set up on a working basis? Since the start of this Dáil, I have repeatedly raised the need for stronger Government action on British demilitarisation. While I acknowledge that some progress has been made, does the Taoiseach agree it is intolerable that the situation in the Border areas close to the constituency I represent, particularly the south Armagh area but also south Fermanagh and south Tyrone, are still saturated with bases, spy posts and troops four years on from the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated earlier, in the context of human rights, the provisions are working in a number of areas in co-operation with our Northern colleagues and I will get an up to date report in that regard. The resources and staff have been allocated. I know the human rights group in the North is also moving in many areas and while they have their own troubles and difficulties they are working hard to make a meaningful impact as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement. In the initial period the groups in the North and South are having a good influence and their work is useful but it will take some years to <Col N="14" /> achieve all that was set out in terms of legislation and specific tasks. There is a settling in process as there are people involved from different persuasions, backgrounds and groupings and, as the Deputy knows, that creates its own difficulties. However, they are working on it.</P>
      <P>On demilitarisation, I do not disagree with the Deputy. The more that can happen in that regard, the better and, as the Deputy has acknowledged, there has been considerable progress. I believe the British Government is committed to continuing as rapidly as it can and as the security situation, which has been improving all the time, allows to remove small, medium sized and especially the larger observation posts. I am glad to see that happening and I hope it will proceed as quickly as possible. I acknowledge that in some areas, including south Armagh, there is still a heavy presence. We have pressed very strongly for that situation to be eased, particularly in sensitive areas, because it is counterproductive and we will continue raise that at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>In order to get a full answer on the review aspect, the Deputy should put down a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The review is ongoing and it is not our intention to continue to extend the additional powers but at this stage it is still necessary to do so until we are absolutely satisfied that the security situation does not require us to continue renewing those Acts. For a more detailed answer as to what has been happening in the review over the last nine months to a year, the Deputy should put down a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return to the question of the international judge. Paragraphs 18 and 19 of the statement issued on 1 August last year stated that investigations would take place in relation to the following people who were murdered: Chief Superintendent Harry Breen, Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Pat Finucane, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright. Since, to my knowledge, no prosecutions have been initiated in respect of any of these people, do I understand correctly that the terms of reference have already been agreed, together with the identity of the person concerned &ndash; which, presumably, the Taoiseach is not in a position to reveal today? Will it be a collective investigation or a series of investigations? Will they take place simultaneously or will one follow after another? Since presumably prosecutions will not be initiated between now and the end of April, what timetable has the Taoiseach in mind for completion of this process? In some cases there may be a recommendation at the end of the investigation that a public inquiry should take place. Can we anticipate finality on these issues or is it open ended? Can the Taoiseach give any indication of a timetable at this stage in relation to all or any individual cases? With no disrespect to the others, these cases are the cause of greater communal conflict. They <Col N="15" /> involve Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the judge will be in place shortly, that his investigative and other staff will be available to him and that the records will also be available. These tragic cases have a high profile. Many have been strenuously investigated during the years. I hope, therefore, the files will enable the judge to reach conclusions fairly quickly. That is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will probably take six months. In a number of other cases we cannot prejudge the outcome, although almost everybody does so. I had better not add to that. However, even in the cases mentioned by the Deputy, there is a widely held view as to what happened. Nevertheless, they must be looked at independently. The Deputy rightly said they have created a lot of tension. I would be very surprised if some or all do not lead to the creation of a full tribunal of inquiry. One of them has a high priority, which is not to detract from the importance of the others. It has a high profile, both domestically and internationally. Frustration with the process would quickly become apparent if the families were to take the view that it would become protracted.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I see no reason why they should not. The judge will not begin his work from scratch. Several of the cases have been the subject of investigations, as aspect on which I do not wish to comment. If one accepts the process in good faith, it will be apparent that there has been a huge amount of work on getting information and building the files on these cases. The public must decide whether the judge's conclusions will finalise matters. However, I would be surprised if he did not quickly conclude that some of the cases will not be resolved by him. That is the generally held view. The process must start soon and must be transparent.</P>

      <P>I put down a question on the Barron inquiry last month but, as a result of a request I received from the Taoiseach's office, I withdrew it because a crucial meeting was due to take place between Justice Barron and a representative of the RUC. Obviously in the Taoiseach's judgment it was not appropriate to refer to the matter on the floor of the House at the time. I withheld my question on the basis that I would receive an outline of the engagement undertaken by Justice Barron, confirmation that it had taken place and an indication of what progress had been made. I received no such information.</P>

Will he also strongly advise Mr. Adams to make himself available before a committee of the US Congress? <Col N="17" /> What is the Taoiseach's view with regard to whether Mr. Adams and his associates should come before this committee to explain their links, if any, with armed organisations in Colombia?</P>

      <P>I understand Justice Barron received an enormous amount of information, data and files, although I do not know if that will resolve many of the issues. He certainly received the information he sought and many of the records. From that he has highlighted areas where there are gaps and where he wants further information. However, he is receiving co-operation and there are direct lines of assistance available to him now, which were not there previously. That has allowed Justice Barron to proceed quickly so that he can bring an interim report to the House after the summer.</P>
      <P>I will make Mr. Adams aware of Deputy Hayes's comments. I have also heard what other members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs have said on the matter. These issues are the subject of congressional hearings in the US next week. That committee is in a position, due to having more reports, data and information, to make progress on these issues. Our committee is entitled to ask Mr. Adams to come before it but I assume the invitation is linked to the fact that the congressional hearings are starting. I expect this matter will be judged by the Oireachtas committee on the basis of what happens at those hearings.</P>

      <P>With regard to the recent incident involving an Irish officer serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO, the position is as follows. On 4 April 2002, Commandant Harry O'Connor was part of an UNTSO four man, unarmed, observer team patrolling the Lebanese side of the border with Israel when the incident occurred. Commandant O'Connor was accompanied by three other UNTSO military observers at the time &ndash; two Norwegians and one French.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident took place at about 10.10 a.m. local time in the UNIFIL area of operations in south Lebanon. The UNTSO patrol was attacked by armed elements-Hizbollah militants near the Shebaa Farms area. The patrol was travelling in clearly marked UN vehicles when armed Hizbollah personnel forced their vehicle to stop. The car windows were broken and the UN observers <Col N="19" /> dragged out of their car and assaulted with rifle butts.</P>
    <P>A separate four man UNIFIL patrol saw the incident and went to help the UNTSO observers. During the scuffle which followed the Hizbollah elements seized the UNIFIL peacekeepers' weapons. One of the UNIFIL officers radioed headquarters which then immediately called the Lebanese authorities to bring the situation under control. Within a few minutes of making this contact UNIFIL was informed that Hizbollah had left the scene.</P>
    <P>Three of the UNTSO military observers &ndash; one Irish, one French and one Norwegian &ndash; were injured and evacuated across the border with Israeli military assistance to a hospital in Sefad in northern Israel. Commandant O'Connor was the most seriously injured, sustaining severe bruising and lacerations to the head, arm and rib area. He was discharged from hospital on Monday, 8 April 2002 and is receiving daily medical attention from a local doctor. I know that the House will join me in wishing him a full and speedy recovery.</P>
    <P>On the day of the incident the UN Security Council was briefed by the UN secretariat on the incident and issued a statement in which the Security Council expressed grave concern at, and protested, the attack on unarmed peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, referring to UN Resolution 1391 of 28 January 2002 in which the Security Council urged the parties to respect the safety of UN peacekeepers in the area. The council members strongly urged that the integrity, safety and freedom of movement of UN peacekeepers in the area be fully respected by all parties. The UN Secretary General also strongly condemned the deliberate assault by Hizbollah elements on unarmed UN military observers operating in south Lebanon.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>On 7 April the Irish ambassador to Lebanon held a meeting with the Lebanese ambassador in Cairo. During the meeting he conveyed the Government's concern at the Shebaa Farms incident and the serious injury inflicted on Commandant O'Connor and his colleagues. The Irish ambassador stressed the demands of both the UN Security Council and the United Nations Secretary General that the safety and freedom of movement of UN peacekeepers and observers be respected by all parties. The Lebanese ambassador noted the points raised and agreed to convey Ireland's concerns to the Lebanese Government, adding that he expressed regret at what had occurred and that Lebanon had not only a legal but also a moral obligation to safeguard such UN operations.</P>
    <P>The Irish ambassador also raised the incident involving Commandant O'Connor with the Syrian authorities in the context of Irish concerns over the possible escalation of regional violence. The Irish ambassador was assured that the matter was one that was being taken very seriously by <Col N="20" /> the Syrian authorities and that Syria was in constant contact with the Lebanese authorities.</P>

      <P>Was there a formal protest lodged with the Lebanese Government about these events? I appreciate, from what the Minister says, it clearly intervened to be of help. What was its response to any such protest? Is the Lebanese Army now in place in that part of southern Lebanon or is that part of southern Lebanon largely still taken over by the Hizbollah group? Was any protest lodged with the Syrian Government, as the main country in the region which financially supports Hizbollah and within which Hizbollah has some of its main offices in Damascus?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a formal protest has been made to the Lebanese and Syrian Governments. For a considerable time after the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from that part of southern Lebanon there was a reluctance on the part of the Lebanese Government to have the army in place. The position has progressively improved. Although it is not necessarily yet at the 100% stage, it is a long distance ahead of where it was a year ago. Therefore, we would look forward to seeing more of the involvement of the Lebanese soldiers in that part of the country, ensuring the rights and integrity of the UN observers are preserved.</P>

      <Quest>the position concerning the purchase of the Sikorsky helicopters for use by the Air Corps; and the position concerning litigation taken by unsuccessful tenderers following his announcement of the awarding of the contract to Sikorsky.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>On 17 January 2002 I authorised my Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations Incorporated, Connecticut, USA, for the purchase of three medium range helicopters &ndash; S-92s &ndash; for search and rescue purposes. The negotiations were also to include an option exercisable within three years by the Department for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision followed from a detailed examination of the original tenders received from the <Col N="21" /> four companies &ndash; Sikorsky, USA; CHC Scotia, Scotland; E.H. Industries Limited, UK and Eurocopter, France &ndash; and an examination of the best and final prices submitted by them in December 2001. In this regard I decided to seek best and final prices from each of the four tenderers because of the expiration of the validity of all the tenders and taking into account the changed international situation after the terrible events of 11 September. Following the submission and examination of the best and final prices, I deemed that the offer from Sikorsky was the most strategically and economically advantageous tender taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition, which were: functional characteristics, technical merit, all maintenance and on-line technical support, after sales service and warranty terms on offer, cost and ready availability of spare parts, tender prices and life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period. I am satisfied, on the basis of the facts presented to me, that the offer from Sikorsky would provide best value for money from the taxpayer's point of view. The timeframe proposed by Sikorsky would see the delivery of three search and rescue helicopters by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Following on from my decision of 17 January 2002, Eurocopter has now instituted judicial review proceedings contesting the decision to open negotiations with Sikorsky. The matter was up for mention in the High Court last Monday, 15 April 2002. The matter was adjourned by consent of all parties to Monday, 13 May 2002 for mention.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to deal with the Chief State Solicitor's office on the judicial review proceedings. It is my intention to be as forthcoming as possible in this regard. However, as the matter is due to come before the courts again in mid-May, I do not wish to say anything further at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the matters raised on the last occasion he answered questions at Question Time, the Minister stated he had met a number of ambassadors and military attachés in relation to this matter. In subsequent media coverage it was stated there was a possibility that either a number of those meetings did not take place or the Minister may have overlooked some of the meetings which took place regarding such representations. Will he tell the House the number of meetings he had with the relevant ambassadors and military attachés of the countries of the companies which made the offers to his Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the other issue which has just been raised.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister, in the context of where matters now stand, advise the House on the grounds upon which a judicial review is being sought by Eurocopter and indicate whether papers have yet been filed in the proceedings on the Minister's behalf opposing those grounds? Will he state the current position with regard to the formal signing of contracts with Sikorsky?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there will be no formal signing of contracts until the judicial review process, which I hope will not take too long, is completed, but clearly I do not have control of these matters. We are anxious to proceed.</P>
      <P>The matter of the judicial review process is being handled by the Chief State Solicitor's office. As I have indicated all along, I want to co-operate as fully as I possibly can and have produced all of the relevant documents which have been sought.</P>
      <P>The case being made by the Chief State Solicitor on my behalf is clear. There were eight clear areas on which a decision would be based. I will not go into the details. Sikorsky was ahead in five, Eurocopter ahead in one and E. H. Industries ahead in two. In the essential area of price Sikorsky was ahead, which would leave us in the final analysis with a saving of &euro;5 million by accepting that particular tender. The case on our side is sufficiently strong. It is very hard to make a judgment on what outcome will emerge in terms of withstanding any challenge, but we obviously have to await that outcome. We will be co-operating as fully as possible. No contract can be signed until these matters are cleared out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the proceedings brought by Eurocopter include a claim &ndash; which I appreciate the Minister may not accept &ndash; that the Minister or his Department failed to comply with Council directives co-ordinating procedures for the award of public supply contracts? In other words, does the Minister accept that there was a failure to comply with the procurement directives of the EU? Do the proceedings include that claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" />Should Eurocopter be successful in that claim, will the Minister confirm that he will have to go to tender anew? Has the Minister any indication of when there is likely to be a full hearing of these proceedings? I assume the date given is an adjournment date for the finding of further documentation. I assume that as yet no date is fixed for the full hearing of the proceedings and that it is unlikely they will be fully heard until next autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not yet clear whether it would ever proceed to that process. Clearly, it will be a matter for the legal advisers of Eurocopter to so decide at a certain stage. It may not move that far. I hope it will not on the basis of allowing us to proceed because these helicopters are essential to the services being provided by the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>I reject as out of hand the contention by Eurocopter that we have not observed the EU procurement rules. In fact, we exhaust them so much at times that it can be a bit frustrating even for Ministers. We stick to the rules to an extraordinary degree. In this case, every aspect with regard to these matters was covered comprehensively. Incidentally, it would be quite extraordinary if Eurocopter or any other contender that failed to succeed found something fundamentally wrong with a procedure, having made absolutely no complaints about it when it was being exercised. I would expect the company or somebody representing the company to have told me at some stage that there was something wrong with what was being done. The company went into both tenders, exercised its rights, never objected and brought nothing to my notice suggesting that there was anything wrong. If there had been something wrong, it would have been useful for the company to have said so. It happened only after the date, when the ball was played, the game was over and when it had lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Given, as the Minister has already stated, the importance of these helicopters to the Defence Forces and the possible timescale of litigation in relation to the proposed cases by Eurocopter, is the Minister in a position to tell the House if an alternative in terms of leasing the helicopters to try overcome the timescale is being considered? Is it too early to consider an alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have tried in the past few years to increase the profile of the Department of Defence in every way. We now have a major contract, one of the biggest we ever had. There was enormous interest in it and very significant public relations efforts made by all sides to present their cases. We have never been in this position before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated to the House originally that I would start to talk about leasing once a contract was signed. I am obviously not in that position yet. In <Col N="24" /> the meantime, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has assured me it is managing to cover the areas extremely well. It is not something in which I can engage until I have signed the contract. I intend to fulfil the promise I made to the House that I would address that matter as soon as I reached that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would agree with me that it is urgently necessary that we acquire new helicopters for air-sea rescue purposes for use by the Defence Forces. Does he agree that the difficulties of recent months now look as if they will delay the acquisition date by a minimum of six months? Furthermore, does he agree that should contentious litigation continue into the autumn and later it will put back the acquisition of these helicopters for a far greater period than is desirable in terms of meeting the needs of the Defence Forces?</P>
      <P>In the context of this litigation continuing and remaining contentious, has the Minister given any consideration to the possibility of retendering for acquisition of the helicopters with a view to bringing the litigation to an end and progressing the obtaining of the helicopters required for the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter that it is urgent and that we are losing time. Nobody can say how much, but that is certainly the case. I have not given the slightest thought to retendering. Everything we did in respect of the tender was above board, and I stand over our actions completely. One way or another, in the kind of world in which we live, somebody else should he lose the next one might start to engage in the same sort of practice. There is no guarantee that would not happen.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate if all political parties supported the decisions that have been taken. The Deputy has challenged me in the House on a number of occasions. I have been able to answer not just truthfully, but comprehensively on every occasion, yet some people want to drag out the issue.</P>
      <P>If we are interested in getting aircraft for the Air Corps, as I am and I think the Deputy is, the case has been made.</P>

      <Quest>the dates when the British and French ambassadors each met with him to lobby in favour of the Air Corps helicopter contract being awarded to one of the unsuccessful tenderers; the nature of the discussions that took place; and the correspondence and other documentation received by him from both the British and French ambassadors in relation to the tenders received.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined the current position with the tender competition for helicopters in the previous question. I hope the legal proceedings will be dealt with expeditiously with a <Col N="25" /> view to moving the process forward and obtaining the much needed helicopters for the Air Corps at the earliest possible date. The Deputy is aware that I dealt with the issue of diplomatic representations and meetings in a comprehensive manner when answering Private Notice Questions on the tender competition for helicopters on 26 March 2002. I do not know what the Deputy hopes to achieve or what his reasons are for raising the issue again, but I will again endeavour to enlighten him.</P>
      <P>I explained to the House on 26 March 2002 that there was an enormous interest in this tender competition. I, and many other Members of the House, received a plethora of representations from many quarters with regard to the competition. These included representations from diplomatic sources extolling the virtues of helicopters manufactured in their own countries. This is no more or less than what could be expected with a contract of this nature and is certainly not unusual. The representations emanated from all sides, including from members of Fine Gael and representations and standard courtesy calls through diplomatic channels. The Deputy is aware that courtesy calls made to me by ambassadors or military attachés are part and parcel of normal day-to-day life in Government in Ireland and in many other countries.</P>
      <P>Specifically, I met with the British and Italian ambassadors at their request. While I did have an approach for a meeting from the French ambassador the meeting did not take place due to the pressure of other commitments at that time. However, I am aware that the Secretary General of my Department met the ambassador. These calls had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the tender competition for helicopters. I ignored all of them. They could not be and were not taken into account in any way. The award of contract criteria for the competition, which I outlined in my previous answer, were clear and unambiguous and were the only criteria used by me in arriving at my decision.</P>
      <P>The decision I made to authorise the opening of negotiations with Sikorsky was taken on the basis that its offer was deemed to be the most strategically and economically advantageous tender, taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition. I made my decision in the interests of the taxpayer, strictly in accordance with the competition criteria. I stand full square behind that decision. There were no underhand dealings or back room collusion of any kind. This is the right decision for the country and for the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to make progress on the contract negotiations but I have to await the outcome of the legal proceedings which come before the High Court on 13 May 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree in the context of the tendering process and his own statement in the House today, which he made previously, that the various meetings he had with <Col N="26" /> ambassadors or the lobbying that went on did not influence him in any way and that with regard to a contract such as this, it is unwise to meet with people knowing that they will lobby in favour of a particular company? Will he acknowledge that this leaves him, to some degree, as a hostage to fortune in that he has met with some people but not with others or that some, such as the American ambassador, saw fit to resubmit to him a new bid previously submitted by Sikorsky, and this lays open the suspicion in the minds of other tenderers that he may be giving favourable treatment to one company rather than another in circumstances where, in fairness to the Minister, he may not be doing so?</P>
      <P>Does he agree also that, should there be a similar tendering process in the future for any major equipment required by any part of the Defence Forces, he should let it be known that he will not entertain meetings in which such lobbying takes place due to the fact that he is open to misrepresentation? Finally, will the Minister agree, and I appreciate he was probably mistaken when he said it, that on the last occasion he indicated that he met all the ambassadors on a similar basis? I think the Minister will now acknowledge that he did not meet with the French ambassador. In so far as he met the French ambassador during the tendering period, I understand it would have been at a social function attended by some 200 other people.</P>

      <P>To answer the last part of the Deputy's question first, I did not say that I met all the ambassadors on the last occasion. It was not only the French ambassador who had an opportunity to meet with the Secretary General of my Department; as far as I know, he met Secretaries General in other Departments. There was no question of the French ambassador not having access and an opportunity to make his case to whomsoever. He was not placed at any disadvantage, nor were his peers from the other countries placed at any advantage by meeting me. I said I ignored all of it. To be honest, I do not agree with the notion that the Minister should not meet anyone.</P>

      <P>One cannot be a Minister in a modern Government and close one's doors to people, some of whom will make representations or offer good ideas, some of which will be discarded. There is much nonsense heard today about transparency and accountability and it will reach the stage where one will not even open the door of one's constituency office because of who might come in, what they might say or what they will report. In a modern country moving forward, people will have meetings with industrialists, trade unionists, etc, and I hope they will always have the confidence to do that knowing that whatever advice is given or case made, they will make their own judgment on what is right for the <Col N="27" /> country and for the taxpayer. We should not be afraid to meet people or to listen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces fully recognise that the singular nature of the military environment does not give anyone a licence for bullying or harassment of any kind. There is absolutely nothing in military life which requires that any individual be singled out, victimised or subjected to abuse or bullying. On the contrary, a collegial team spirit is essential to the maintenance of a military organisation and will be undermined by such practices. Such behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have had formal policies and procedures on sexual harassment and bullying since February 1996. The report of the Government task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, of March 2001, required all public and private organisations to reassess their policies. In 2001, the Defence Forces reviewed and revised their procedures to incorporate the best practice in both the wider public service and in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Lectures and briefings on the topic form an integral element of the training syllabus for recruit, cadet and career courses and overseas training. The Chief of Staff has stated that commanders at all levels should bear in mind that it is a command responsibility to ensure that the military environment is free from any form of sexual harassment and bullying. He has further stated that any failure by a commander to ensure that such is the case, or to deal adequately with complaints of sexual harassment or bullying, would be considered a dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>Other measures taken to address the problem include the following: female liaison officers in each barracks to assist female personnel in matters which they may not wish to bring through the normal chain of command; women's days to cover issues such as interpersonal relationships, women's health issues and other matters relating specifically to women; an information campaign of posters and booklets in user friendly terms to convey the essential message of the administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships; and briefings and open discussions with mixed gender attendance.</P>
      <P>In August 2001, the Chief of Staff established a special military steering group to examine these issues. I invited Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, to join the group as an expert civilian chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" />
      <i>Additional information.</i>Dr. Doyle was asked to determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures, and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area. She was joined by two other civilian experts and by senior military personnel.</P>
    <P>All serving female members of the PDF, some 453 women, were issued with a questionnaire, along with a large representative 10% sample of males. There was a high response rate of 54.5% overall. The results of the survey indicate that a significant number of respondents perceive themselves as experiencing unacceptable levels of harassment, bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment.</P>
    <P>Dr. Doyle and the joint civilian-military group recently presented their completed report to me.</P>
    <P>I have fully accepted the report and its recommendations. The report notes that it will be essential that external civilian expertise be involved throughout the implementation process for the various recommendations. On the evidence of the research findings, there is a need for immediate action on a number of fronts. As an immediate initial step in implementing these recommendations, I have therefore established the independent monitoring group recommended in the report. The monitoring group will be chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle and will comprise the Deputy Chief of Staff, support and an assistant secretary of my Department. The monitoring group will oversee, on my behalf, the drawing up and implementation of a plan to give effect to the fundamental reforms which the report has recommended. A separate military implementation group will be established by the Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>In addition, an equality steering group, as recommended by the report, will be established and chaired by a member of the Labour Court. A consultative group will also be put in place. I know that we will have the active support and participation of the representative associations in this exercise. As an immediate measure, a confidential help line was made available to members of the Defence Forces from 5 April 2002.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report must now be comprehensively built into the general employee relations and human resources management system across and through all ranks and all services and corps of the Defence Forces. The report emphasises the need for continuous external review, including a further external survey in spring 2004, which will involve a thorough revisiting of all the aspects covered in the current report. That second review process in 2004 will also be undertaken for official publication. Dr. Doyle is being asked to convene an early meeting of the monitoring group to come forward with proposals on how best to proceed with implementation of the recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree that this controversy was only <Col N="29" /> sparked following the publication of an independent report by a retired Army officer and that initially the Defence Forces denied there was bullying in the Defence Forces, which is probably reflective of the blind eye turned to the problem, willingly or otherwise? The Minister pointed out that anti-bullying policies and procedures have been in place since 1996. Does he agree that these policies, which were issued to all Departments, have been a failure? While the Minister is not responsible for other Departments, it is a problem that may exist across the board. Is the Minister satisfied that the individuals who are giving lectures on bullying and so forth are qualified to do so? Perhaps they are not in a position or do not have the knowledge or expertise to recognise bullying.</P>

      <P>First, the Defence Forces is the first organisation in the country to have the issues of sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination and harassment generally studied in such a detailed way. Second, 80% of the members of the Defence Forces said they are satisfied with their job and their peers. I want to put that on one level. To come to the Deputy's questions, I never said, nor did anyone say on my behalf, that we did not have a problem. It is fair to say that Dr. Clonan's work, although not exhaustive because it covered 60 females, 100% of whom he said had been sexually harassed, did not prove to be the position. Having said that, it was a wake up call and following on that work, the expert group was established, chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle. The figures which now emerge are very different but they are still serious and warrant close attention and management.</P>
      <P>We are setting up the monitoring group and have accepted all the recommendations. We have a job to do. There is no place for sexual harassment, bullying or discrimination in any organisation. We have to root it out and we will do everything that is recommended by the expert group to deal with it. We are not closing our eyes to the problem. We know it exists and I hope we will see a dramatic change in the next few years which will reflect the work of the group and the efforts of the Chief of Staff and his colleagues in dealing with it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that when women were first recruited into the Army, they were under the impression that a women's corps would be set up? Approximately 4% or 5% of the Army is made up of women, which is mere tokenism, and a certain amount of sexual harassment is almost tolerated so that we can be politically correct. Greater effort should be made to recruit more females into the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing that. There has been a significant increase in the number of females coming into the Defence Forces in the past few years, although the overall numbers are <Col N="30" /> quite low. Sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination are old phenomena, but we are regrettably late in dealing with them comprehensively. The measures being put in place nationally as a result of equality legislation are new in many organisations. It is to be hoped that legislative, regulatory and management based ways of dealing with the problem will be much more effective in the future. This is well deserved and necessary.</P>

      <P>The main age for general service enlistment and enlistment of cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is 17 years. There is an exception to the general age limit in the case of apprentices, who may be recruited at age 16 years. However, apprentices are not assigned to any military duties until they have completed up to four years of apprenticeship training, at which time they are close to 20 years of age at the minimum. All applicants for the Defence Forces who are under 18 years must have the written consent of a parent or legal guardian. Military personnel who are under 18 years are specifically excluded from overseas service. The minimum age at which young people can join their local FCA or Slua Muirí unit is 17 years. I am satisfied with all these arrangements.</P>
      <P>This year's Trócaire Lenten campaign sought to draw attention to the appalling abuse of young children and their deployment as combatants in armed conflict in certain Third World countries. In addition, the campaign seeks the raising of the age of recruitment to armed forces worldwide to 18 years. Earlier this year Trócaire raised with me the question of raising the minimum age for recruitment to our Defence Forces to 18 years. The worthy humanitarian issue raised by Trócaire concerning the violent abuse of children in armed conflict is an important one which merits international attention. However, it is completely unconnected with the voluntary recruitment of a 17 year old, with parental consent, to our Defence Forces. Representatives from Trócaire recently met senior officials from my Department and officers of the Defence Forces and the position of the Defence Forces on recruitment, training and deployment of personnel was fully clarified. I take this opportunity to advise the House that Ireland has signed the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the cornerstone of the Trócaire campaign.</P>

      <P>Have there been many recruits under 18 years of age in recent years? I am also concerned that a person of 17 years may not have fulfilled his or her second level educational ambitions. What facilities, if any, are in place within the Defence Forces to allow such recruits to complete their education, including their leaving certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The average proportion of recruits under 18 years over the last two years has been approximately 25%. As some of them are close to 18 years, I cannot give the actual figures. They may be 17 and a half but are under 18 years.</P>
      <P>In the Defence Forces we have, and intend to enhance in whatever way we can, the educational opportunities for advancement which our recruits may seek. These opportunities go all the way up the educational scale. This is very important. It is also important to take into account that the ages of recruitment to apprenticeship in a whole range of occupations are 16 and 17 years. People must decide at this age to what they wish to apply themselves. We would lose out considerably by not giving people the option of joining the Defence Forces at this age. Recruits of this age do not, however, serve on United Nations missions. They must have the necessary training and so on before that can happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, the Reserve Defence Forces review implementation board, on which the FCA is represented, has been established at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the Reserve steering group. I established the special steering group in 1998 to undertake a study of the Reserve and the group reported to me in September 1999. Under the aegis of the military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have advised that the process of <Col N="32" /> formulating revised structures for the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing and the draft Reserve Defence Forces review implementation board report is expected to be submitted to the Chief of Staff shortly.</P>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised around a three brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured. It is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years. The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide geographical spread. This aspect will be generally retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing the FCA with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, an important change recommended by the study of the Reserve is that members of the FCA should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to suitable qualifications, personal availability and appropriate advance training. Service by reservists on overseas peace support missions in other countries is quite common. General criteria governing selection for overseas service come within the scope of representation and any matters relating to overseas service by members of the Reserve which come within the scope of representation will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum.</P>
    <P>The question of the security of civilian employment for the members of the Reserve who may wish to serve overseas will be considered as part of the implementation process. Accordingly, pending the completion of the implementation plan applications to serve overseas have not been received from members of the Reserve. I must emphasise that the steering group was mindful of the need to preserve and retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

      <P>By 31 March 2002 a total of 16,125 claims had been received in my Department from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. A total of 254 claims have been the subject of court awards with a further 10,904 being disposed of through out-of-court settlements. A further 505 claims were either withdrawn by plaintiffs or dismissed by the courts. The number of claims outstanding is 4,462. Following the December 1999 judgment of the Supreme Court in the leading Army hearing loss case, Hanley <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence, my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and in consultation with the Law Society of Ireland, established an early settlement scheme for dealing with the outstanding Army hearing loss litigation claims. The scheme operated successfully on a pilot basis during 2000 and 1,099 claims were settled by direct negotiations between solicitors representing plaintiffs and officials of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and my Department.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the early settlement scheme commenced in January 2001. Five firms of loss adjusters were engaged to augment the resources of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in negotiating settlements with plaintiffs' solicitors. This second phase has been successful in settling a further 2,733 cases. On 20 March 2002 the High Court in Dublin granted an adjournment in Army hearing loss litigation for most of the Easter term with cases only being listed for the last eight days of term. Any adjournment such as this is helpful as it allows staff in my Department to devote more time to achieving settlements under the scheme. I am happy about the success of the scheme and the results achieved and hope the vast majority of the 4,462 outstanding claims will be settled in this way in order that the remaining plaintiffs can have their claims resolved at fair levels of compensation with significant savings to the Exchequer in court costs.</P>

      <P>I am not certain that the lack of adherence to what were accepted principles in regard to safeguarding the hearing of those involved in Defence Forces operations would have been either the cause or the problem in all cases, but it was certainly a problem in a significant number of cases. I hope I am correct in stating that only one claim was made in the period after the measures were put in place to ensure 100% application of the hearing protection guidelines. That case did not proceed and it was certainly not successful. That indicates a strong adherence to the hearing protection mechanisms the Defence Forces are developing and monitoring on an ongoing basis. There is no excuse for proper precautions not being taken, even though I have noticed people using jackhammers and other tools on the streets and not using the proper protection. Perhaps my eyesight is not as good as it should be, but I do not see these people acting in the way they should. There may be a need for organisations other than the Defence Forces to take action in this area. However, I am satisfied that current measures are adequate to ensure that we will never again be faced with this kind of problem.</P>

      <P>The question of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review. Requests from the UN for Irish participation in new missions are considered on a case by case basis within the context of the United Nations stand-by arrangement system, UNSAS. As I have indicated previously, in October 1998 Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations in relation to UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under this system. There would, however, be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the despatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter authorising the deployment of an international security assistance force, ISAF, in Afghanistan for six months to assist in the maintenance of security in Kabul and the surrounding areas, so that the Afghan Interim Authority and the personnel of the United Nations can operate in a secure environment. Acting under chapter VII of the UN Charter means that the ISAF, the lead nation of which <Col N="35" /> is the United Kingdom, is authorised to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate.</P>
    <P>I am agreeable in principle to the deployment of members of the Defence Forces to ISAF, subject to a full assessment of all the attendant factors. In this regard, a Defence Forces assessment team, comprising three personnel, will undertake a fact-finding visit to Afghanistan in the near future during which discussions will be held with the lead nation, the United Kingdom, to establish whether a suitable role can be identified for Defence Forces personnel. A security assessment will also be carried out by the team taking account of the situation on the ground at the time.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am not sure if you are aware of the details of this matter, but your office issued recommendations in relation to deadlines for the receipt of amendments to legislation tabled by the Government. It is simply impossible for us to respond to your request and comply with your guidance with regard to how we do our business in this House because the Bill in question, the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Bill, 2002, was circulated this morning without an explanatory memorandum. In addition, I understand that as we speak the much trumpeted agreement from those parts of civic society directly affected by the provisions of the Bill has not been forthcoming. Therefore, to attempt to complete all Stages tonight would be unacceptable and contrary to your recommended parliamentary procedures. In view of the fact that we have next week to deal with the Bill, I suggest that the Taoiseach considers making time available for it then in order to give us time to table the amendments that would be needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the other matters, I am aware of and apologise for the short period in which the Bill was circulated. This was because discussions were ongoing. I spoke to the Minister for Health and Children a short time ago when he informed me that the issue which had been delaying agreement has now been resolved. The Bill will proceed to the conclusion of Second Stage only tonight, at which point perhaps it could be re-examined. I understand the Minister is still anxious to take Committee and Remaining Stages tomorrow as intended. I propose we conclude Second Stage tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that clarification because, as stated in an earlier notice, we were originally going to take all Stages.

      <P>I take the opportunity to offer on behalf of the Government and the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Parties my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the two brave gardaí, Garda Tony Tighe and Garda Michael Padden, who lost their lives at the weekend. The whole country has been immensely moved by the tragic deaths of these two men who gave their lives in the service of the community, protecting members of the public, just half an <Col N="42" /> hour after coming on duty in the early hours of Sunday morning last.</P>
      <P>The nation was just learning of the awful circumstances of this terrible tragedy when we were further shocked by the news of the death of Private Peadar Flaherty in the service of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor. Again, I offer my sincere condolences and those of the Government parties to Private Flaherty's family, friends and colleagues. These three brave men made the ultimate sacrifice dying in the service of their country. We remember Tony, Michael, Peadar and their families in our prayers. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to extend the sympathy of my colleagues and the Fine Gael Party to the families, friends and colleagues of Garda Tony Tighe, Garda Michael Padden and Private Peadar Ó Flaithearta, all of whom gave their lives in recent days while on duty and serving the public interest. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedies which have brought such overwhelming sadness, I hope that the bereaved will take some small consolation from the outpouring of public grief which has been so obvious all over the country in the past few days.</P>
      <P>The work done by peacemakers such as Private Ó Flaithearta serving under the auspices of the United Nations, in his case in East Timor, is frequently acknowledged at home and abroad. As a country we rightly take pride in the professionalism with which members of the Army and Garda Síochána have carried out their duties in so many overseas locations during the past 40 years. They have done much to bring honour to this country and have contributed significantly to the making and maintenance of peace in the many jurisdictions where they have served.</P>
      <P>At home, the work of gardaí is so pervasive in our lives that we do not give it the public acknowledgement and appreciation it deserves often enough. They have been so successful in fully integrating themselves into the communities in which they are stationed that we are at times inclined to take for granted the many services which they perform both day and night for 365 days of the year to ensure that the rest of us can get on with our lives.</P>
      <P>We should never underestimate the sacrifices and risks undertaken for us by members of the Garda Síochána. Garda Tighe and Garda Padden were the fortieth and forty-first members of the force to die on duty. Like so many before them, when they responded to the call for help in the early hours of last Sunday morning they knew they were exposing themselves to risk, but in the ultimate act of human courage they put the safety and security of our community above their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paying tribute today to their personal act of heroism we also pay tribute to the force as a whole. The Garda Síochána has always been here for the citizens of this country. There is not a man, woman or child who does not owe it a debt <Col N="43" /> of gratitude. The Garda is there for us in good times and bad, in times of crisis and normality, in our moments of sorrow and joy. On this sad occasion, it is appropriate that from this House we send the men and women of the Garda Síochána a message of solidarity. We stand with you, we pledge that you will receive all the support, legislative and material, that you require to serve the people of this country as loyally and effectively as you have done for so many years.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my sympathy to the families of Garda Tony Tighe, Garda Michael Padden and Private Peadar Ó Flaithearta. May they rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend the sincerest condolences of my party to the relatives and families of Garda Tony Tighe, Garda Mick Padden and Private Peadar Ó Flaithearta. When I heard the news on Sunday morning I immediately contacted Donnybrook Garda Station from where the two gardaí earlier left to go on duty. I expressed my condolences directly to the sergeant in charge, superintendent Gerry Phillips and his colleagues in the Garda station. I ask the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Minister for Defence to convey directly to the family of the soldier killed on UN duty on behalf of the Republic of Ireland our appreciation for the work he did and sympathy for the tragic circumstances in which his unfortunate death took place. It brings home to us all the true nature of public service and the lives of those engaged in public service on our behalf.</P>
      <P>Uniquely, the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces provide a front line of defence for citizens of the State. Many of their members have died in the course of that duty. Such occasions bring home to us all the nature of their job, the danger they face on our behalf, the risks they frequently face and the injuries, including death, which they sometimes sustain. On my own behalf and that of my party, I offer our wholehearted condolences to the family and relatives of the three unfortunate victims in recent days.</P>

    <P>This is a small country and the loss of two gardaí and one soldier in such tragic circumstances has an inordinately deep effect on the community. The violent deaths of the two gardaí throw into sharp relief the unacceptability of such behaviour in a small country which still possesses the sense of community lost in other countries. It is important to reassure those who put themselves on the front line that their interests and the work they do will be given priority in terms of <Col N="44" /> resources. We hope their loss will instigate a review of the type of resources they have, whether in terms of their equipment or the conditions in which they work. We should not leave any stone unturned to ensure they get the resources they need and such tragedies do not happen in the future.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate the fear of violence, particularly street violence, now pervasive across the country? Apart from the deaths of the gardaí to whom we have paid tribute, does the Taoiseach realise that in the past week alone there were four violent deaths in Dublin? A young man was stabbed in Tallaght, a young man was killed in a brawl in Portmarnock, a man was shot dead in Blanchardstown and a man was murdered in St. Stephen's Green across from the Shelbourne Hotel in the middle of the day. Does the Taoiseach appreciate that many young men are in hospital, some of whom were kicked into a coma during street violence? Does he realise that parents in all urban centres throughout the country are afraid to let their children go into town? Does he realise that young men and women are reluctant to go out to their normal places to socialise because of the fear of random violence? Does he realise that young women, who were afraid to walk home after dark, are now afraid to go out during the day when places, such as St. Stephen's Green, are no longer safe in broad daylight?</P>
      <P>Against that background, does the Taoiseach agree that the zero tolerance campaign was a slogan substituting for a policy? Does he agree it was a con and a charade and that no real policies have been put in place by the Government? The proof is the fact that assaults causing grievous bodily harm increased by 131% in the year 2000 and are still increasing, while the Administration in its dying days continues to stand idly by and do nothing about it.</P>

Does he believe after five years that such a response from a senior Minister in his Administration is both sensitive and responsible?</P>

      <P>The recent Garda report shows an increase in the number of assaults recorded as headline offences. However, it also shows that 84% of those assaults are regarded as non-headline offences, not as serious offences. In 1999 proceedings were taken in more than 8,500 non-indictable assault cases. The corresponding figures for recent years show a decline in this regard. Any case of assault or attack on young or old people is sad. In many cases the people involved in anti-social behaviour do not come from poverty stricken backgrounds. The opposite is the case as they have too much money, drink and drugs.</P>

Is the Taoiseach proud that this is the objective assessment by a researcher from a State agency, the Combat Poverty Agency? After five years of boom, when people ask where the money went, we can now point to a conclusion objectively drawn by a researcher to the effect that the richest 10% walked away with 25% of the benefits that were collectively put in place by the workers and entrepreneurs of this country, and that the poorest 20% were left with a mere 5%.

      <P>Regarding Deputy Quinn's point, under the assessment of consistent poverty and the methodology which was set in late 1996 by the Government of the time, the national anti-poverty strategy report, which was published recently, shows that over 200,000 people have been taken out of the category of consistent poverty. That target was set by the Government of which the Deputy was a member and with which I agree. They are the facts based on the same criteria today. The measurement of consistent poverty set down by the previous Government and recommended by the ESRI was reduced from 10% in 1997 to just slightly over 6% today and it shows that 200,000 people were taken out of poverty. Consistent poverty among children has more than halved, falling from 17% five years ago to 8% two years ago. The ESRI and NAPS assessment reckon that it will go down to about 6%.</P>
      <P>Unemployment has been reduced from 10.3% to 4% while long-term unemployment has been reduced by almost 6% to just over 1%. Over 300,000 jobs have been created. We have the best minimum wage rate in Europe. The EU and OECD reports on the Budget Statement show that the least well-off in society gained from the budget. These are the facts.</P>

      <P>Even if he wanted to and some suspect that he did, it would be very difficult, given the rate of economic growth over the last five <Col N="50" /> years, to make the poor poorer in absolute terms. That would have been some achievement and it manifestly could not and did not happen. Assuming that the Taoiseach was in agreement with the Minister for Finance's five budgets, in areas where there was discretion and a choice and where money was being given back, is the Taoiseach suggesting that these facts are lies? Is the Taoiseach questioning the research done by the Combat Poverty Agency which showed that 10% of the richest sector in our society received, as a result of votes in this House, 25% of the rebates returned by way of tax reductions, while at the same time 20% of the population received merely 5%? That is the net question. Can the Taoiseach say that the statistics I put forward are lies and he does not accept as true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that they are true. Mr. Walsh's analysis in his recent reports is that the best way to deal with the poorest people is to deal with the issue of child poverty and with the issues of consistent poverty and I agree with him. He also complimented and supported the Government measures where, in the last few years, we have given families of three an increase of £80 per month. Under the previous Government, they were given £7 per month.

Is legislation necessary and will it be published in the lifetime of this Dáil?

      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): </b>At the outset, I am deeply conscious that the events now under discussion will again lead to the revisiting upon the victim of the traumatic ordeal to which she was subjected over a protracted period, and which were the subject of the arrest, trial and sentencing of <Col N="60" /> the perpetrator of those horrific crimes. Neither I nor, I believe, anyone in this House would have wanted such an outcome at a time when the victim deserved time and space to put behind her the awful torture to which she was subjected. I would like, therefore, at the beginning of my contribution, to offer a sincere apology to the victim in this case who is obviously suffering further pain and hurt due to the continued public controversy over this matter. I genuinely hope that after today we can move on and let the matter rest. I also hope that, with the courage the victim has shown in dealing with the past, she will now be able to build a new future for herself.</P>
    <P>I intend, first and foremost, to set out the full facts of this matter as far as I have established them from the records in my Department but, first, I want to say, with all the force I can muster, that I have nothing to hide and that I conducted myself with the utmost integrity and propriety at all stages. I wish to state categorically that the false and baseless charges that have been laid against me by Members of this House &ndash; charges of attempting to interfere with the Judiciary, of collusion in some kind of conspiracy and of deliberate concealment of the facts are not only false, but the Deputies opposite now know them to be false. The facts show this clearly to be the case and all reasonable commentators concur.</P>
    <P>The outcome from the statements in court by Mr. Justice O'Sullivan on 9 and 10 April has had profound consequences, including the resignation of Deputy Molloy as Minister of State after 37 years public service in this House. I believe all of us in this House will sympathise with Deputy Molloy who has paid a very high price for what happened. In this regard, I should also put on the record of the House that there was no personal contact between Deputy Molloy and myself in relation to this case, either before, during or after the statements in court by Mr. Justice O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>I intend, for the information of the House, to set out the facts relating to me and my Department arising from the statements made in court by Mr. Justice Philip O'Sullivan on 9 and 10 April last. First, I will deal with the issue of the telephone call made by the official in the courts policy division of my Department to Mr. Justice O'Sullivan on 19 March 2002. The reason behind this phone call was totally innocent and was not, as some have portrayed it, some sort of inappropriate, nefarious or even conspiratorial act. The officer involved was motivated simply and solely by a desire to be helpful. On 19 March 2002, the Minister's office in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform received a telephone request from an official in the office of the Minister of State for the phone number of Mr. Justice O'Sullivan's secretary. The official in my office was informed that the reason for the request was that the Minister of State wished to confirm on behalf of a constituent if the judge had received correspondence from that constituent, a Ms Anne Naughton.</P>
    <P>It is important to state at this point that no mention was made to the official in my office that <Col N="61" /> the correspondence related to an ongoing court case. This official asked a colleague in the courts policy division for a telephone number at which the then Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, or someone in his office could contact Mr. Justice O'Sullivan. The official looked up the telephone number held on file for Mr. Justice O'Sullivan. He found the number but was not entirely sure that it was the correct number for the judge. To be helpful, therefore, and to be sure that the number he would pass on to be forwarded to Deputy Molloy's office would be the correct one, he decided to ring the number he had found on file to verify that it was indeed correct. On ringing the number, the telephone was answered by Mr. Justice O'Sullivan and the official felt obliged to explain to the judge why he had telephoned his number. He told Mr. Justice O'Sullivan that the then Minister of State's office had approached the Department for a telephone number for him, the judge, and that he had telephoned to make sure, in advance of passing on the number he had on file, that it was correct. The judge indicated to the official from the courts policy division that he would be available for a short period &ndash; about 20 minutes &ndash; in his chambers.</P>
    <P>In my statement of 10 April, I explained how the question of the judge's home telephone number arose and that the judge made it clear that he would not take a telephone call at home. At no stage was there any suggestion that a telephone call, <i>per se</i>, would be improper. Indeed, the notion that a telephone call to a judge is to be viewed <i>per se </i>as an impropriety is manifestly ludicrous. Neither the official nor the judge had knowledge, at that point, as to the likely purpose of the telephone call. It is important, at this juncture, to remind Members of the House that Mr. Justice O'Sullivan has confirmed, in so far as his knowledge and recollection of the matter is concerned, that this is a full and accurate statement of the facts. I would hope that the Members opposite, if they are still disinclined to accept my version of the events, would at least take account of what the judge has verified to be an accurate statement of the facts.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made to imply that as the official who placed the telephone call to Mr. Justice O'Sullivan worked in the courts policy division, he was or should have been aware that that division had dealt with representations made by Deputy Molloy in the Spring of the previous year or was dealing with further representations made by Deputy Molloy in January 2002. I want to put on the record of the House the factual position in relation to this matter. The position is that the officer in question had no personal dealings with either set of representations which were received in the division some ten months apart. The division deals with approximately 700 representations a year, from Deputies of all parties, Senators of all parties, Ministers, Ministers of State and members of the public. A majority of these representations relate to court cases. Due to this volume of representations, the represen<Col N="62" /> tations made by Deputy Molloy would not particularly stand out in the minds of any of the staff in the division, much less in the mind of an officer who had had no direct dealings with them and would not, therefore, be aware of them.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this officer had no ulterior motive in calling the judge's number on 19 March. He was simply complying with a legitimate request to get a telephone number for the then Minister of State's office and he did no more than that in an effort to be helpful. To attribute any other motive to the official is a gross injustice to his integrity. I have said outside the House, and I will repeat it here, that in the five years I have served as Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform I have been struck by the diligence, dedication and probity of officials at all levels. On their behalf, I will not accept any attempt to impugn their good names, either directly or indirectly, by anyone in this House or outside it.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal with the issue of the representations I received from Deputy Molloy about the Naughton case. In this regard, let me first say that I receive well over 12,000 representations per year from members of the public and Members of the Oireachtas &ndash; Deputies of all parties, from Senators of all parties, Ministers of State and other Ministers. These representations are formally acknowledged by staff in my office and passed on to the relevant sections in my Department for attention and for the preparation of replies. Replies are signed by me or on my behalf, but rarely would I have time personally to study the detail of such representations or replies, given the overall volume involved. I challenge any Member of the parties opposite who has had the privilege of serving as a Minister to state categorically that they read all correspondence coming into their office and each and every reply, including each and every acknowledgement emanating from their office. Those who have served as Ministers know that that is not the case. If they were to do this they would have precious little time for the discharge of their fuller functions as Ministers in relation to the business of their Departments and their responsibilities to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Some commentators outside of this House have sought to argue that it is inconceivable that a Minister would not recall correspondence &ndash; even repeated correspondence &ndash; from another Minister about an individual case. Deputies Opposite who have held ministerial office know full well that this is nonsense, especially in circumstances where all that is involved is issuing a letter of refusal in standard format. They know that especially in large Departments it is not a question of mulling over a few letters a week but of receiving and issuing thousands of pieces of correspondence a year. I had absolutely no recollection of correspondence with Deputy Molloy with regard to the Naughton case. I had no knowledge of the existence of correspondence between Deputy Molloy and myself in this matter until it was brought to my attention, following the state<Col N="63" /> ment by Mr. Justice O'Sullivan on 10 April last. I will let the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I was initially apprised on the morning of Wednesday, 10 April 2002 of the correspondence which had been handled by the courts policy division because of the focus on that division at the time in relation to contact with a member of the Judiciary. I referred to this correspondence in the statement issued on my behalf on Wednesday afternoon, 10 April. Later that day, following a search which I had directed be made of all divisions in my Department, it was brought to my attention that correspondence from Deputy Molloy had also been received and processed in the crime division and the prisons division. On learning of this I decided that all the correspondence should be put in the public domain and so instructed my officials on Thursday, 11 April. This resulted in the further statement issued on my behalf on Thursday afternoon with copies of all the correspondence with Deputy Molloy in relation to this case discovered in my Department.</P>
    <P>It has been represented that this slight delay in discovering that there was other correspondence in the Department, aside from that in the courts policy division, is not believable and falsely represented that I was trying to hide this correspondence and only decided to release it when FOI requests were submitted. This is nonsense. As soon as I was apprised that there was further correspondence, I directed that it all be released, save for some material containing personal information about private individuals or comments which had to do with the merits of the particular court case. All the correspondence was in the public domain within a little more than 24 hours of Mr. Justice O'Sullivan's statement on the morning of Wednesday, 10 April, referring to the telephone call he had received from an official in my Department. As has been pointed out, not just by me but by various commentators in the media and elsewhere, there could be no basis whatsoever for my seeking to conceal correspondence which only went to underline the propriety with which I handled this matter.</P>
    <P>The FOI requests &ndash; beginning with an FOI request from <i>The Irish Times</i> on the evening of 10 April &ndash; had no bearing on the issue. It was a matter of certainty, from the beginning, that there would be FOI requests. To the best of my knowledge, my Department receives more FOI requests than any other, most of which have to do with matters that are not the subject of public interest. That there would be an FOI request on a matter of significant public controversy was a certainty, from the beginning, and the notion that its arrival somehow came as a surprise and caused a change of strategy, in terms of what would or would not be published, is preposterous.</P>
    <P>The charge that I would interfere with the Judiciary &ndash; I will put it as strong as attempting to pervert the course of justice &ndash; is deeply hurtful to me. As a solicitor, no less as Minister for <Col N="64" /> Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am most deeply sensitive of the importance of the separated roles and responsibilities of the Executive and the Judiciary. I would and never have done anything, either by commission or omission, to interfere with that relationship. I have too much respect for the institutions of the State to conduct myself in that way and I am greatly disappointed with the efforts of some of the Members opposite to impute to me motives and actions alien to my personal, professional and political philosophy. Apart from that, I cannot imagine the reason Deputies opposite believe, even from a purely selfish point of view, a Minister would see fit to put his head on the block in order to assist a child abusing rapist whom he does not even know. Perhaps it says more about their perception of the world and their understanding of the duties of public office than it does of mine.</P>
    <P>I wish to address another deliberate falsehood that was allowed gain a degree of currency during last week. It has been suggested that any contact between officers of my Department and members of the Judiciary is inappropriate. I understand Deputy Noonan even suggested that there was a protocol in the Department forbidding such contact and that this was being ignored under my stewardship as Minister. This is nonsense. Officers in the courts policy division of my Department, in particular, are regularly in telephone and other contact with members of the Judiciary and this was always the case even before I became Minister, and when Deputy Owen had the honour of serving as Minister for Justice. The contact is necessary to deal with a wide range of day-to-day organisational matters. Judges initiate these contacts as often as officials do.</P>
    <P>It is true that there is a strict rule that officials of the Department should not discuss with judges any matters relating to particular proceedings before the courts. This rule is scrupulously observed and was so observed in the present instance. There has been criticism of the fact that Deputy Molloy forwarded representations to me concerning an ongoing court case and it has been suggested that it is inappropriate for a public representative to write to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform concerning any court case. That is a point of view which perhaps is deserving of consideration for the future. However, the records in my Department suggest that a long-standing practice, going back over many years, has been for public representatives to make such representations. Many Deputies, even on the benches opposite, well know that this practice exists and engage in it. I will spare the blushes of Deputies opposite and refrain from referring to any particular instances.</P>
    <P>There was a ludicrous proposition that no official should contact a judge for his or her number unless the official knew that the person seeking the number did not propose to discuss court business. In other words, junior officials should act as sort of protectors of the judicial ear. The <Col N="65" /> notion that a junior official should take upon himself or herself the task of filtering or screening calls to judges is preposterous and would, if implemented in practice, rightly be resented by judges who must be presumed to be better placed than anybody else to tell a caller whether the subject matter of their personal conversation does or does not amount to an impropriety. What happened in this case amply demonstrates that the Judiciary knows where the line between propriety and its opposite lies.</P>

I state categorically that nothing untoward was done, no rules or protocols were broken, there was no collusion and no conspiracy.

      <P>The revelations of last week were extraordinary. Like the Minister, I will commence by saying something about the appalling position of the victim in this case. For ten years this young woman as a child suffered multiple rape, buggery and sexual abuse at the hands of a vicious father who regularly threatened her life should she reveal to anyone what was taking place. She has described her home life as one of imprisonment and torture. With great courage, after the final act of abuse, which occurred when she was 18 years of age, she went to the Garda and prevailed with courage until the trial took place in the Central Criminal Court where she had to endure the stress and strain of giving evidence and being cross-examined. The case lasted in total seven days. Throughout her father denied his guilt, but she persisted in her case and was vindicated last October by a jury unanimously finding her father guilty of horrendous offences which destroyed her childhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated: &ldquo;I cannot imagine the reason . . . a Minister would see fit to put his head on the block in order to assist a child abusing rapist whom he does not even know.&rdquo; In this context the actions of the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, remain a mystery to me and, I am sure, not only to Members of this House, but the overwhelming number of people outside who have given any thought to this issue. Deputy Molloy intervened in this case at an early stage. Well before it came to trial he was writing letters at the behest of the sister of the man concerned to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister. It seems he went on some kind of crusade on this man's behalf at the request of his sister. We know letters went to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it is disingenuous for him to say anyone is <Col N="66" /> accusing the Minister for Justice of impropriety in the context of any contacts he has had with any member of the Judiciary. No such accusation has been made, nobody is saying the Minister made any improper contact and that the letters he sent in reply to Deputy Molloy were anything less than proper.</P>
    <P>We do not yet know enough about this affair. Not everything that should be made available and published has been made available. I made freedom of information requests seeking certain information and I want the Minister to confirm that the information will be made available. I want to see copies of all correspondence between the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and his constituent, Ann Naughton, and copies of all internal memos relating to this matter in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That documentation must be published. All internal memos within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform relating to this matter should also be published.</P>
    <P>The Minister must tell the House whether he is aware of any contacts of any nature having been made directly by the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, with the local Garda Síochána concerning this case. Are there any records, be they memorandums or any other type of correspondence, which would indicate that contacts were being made by the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, with people other than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? The Minister is accountable to this House for the Garda Síochána. He has access to that information and we are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, went on this crusade. It may be that it was presented to him before the trial that this man was innocently accused of horrendous offences. By the time the trial had taken place, there could be no excuse for him continuing to lobby on behalf of Patrick Naughton. It is extraordinary that the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, saw fit, within days of Mr. Naughton's conviction, to send a letter to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, at the behest of this man's sister, to inquire whether this man could be given temporary release pending sentencing. What thought did he have for the victim? The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have said that we must have thought for the victim. What thought did Deputy Molloy have for the victim when, within days of what must have been an emotionally draining and enormously distressing trial, his preoccupation was whether he could get temporary release for the convicted father? Perhaps Deputy Molloy will explain that.</P>
    <P>He said previously that he was merely making representations; he was forwarding letters. The Members of this House are not a postal service. We must apply our judgment to the things constituents ask us to do. We must make choices and, on occasion, moral judgments. We must choose sides. Are we on the side of the victim, who has <Col N="67" /> gone through a trial in which her father has been convicted, or are we on the father's side seeking to have him released? We make choices in the context of standards in politics. We are not just paper shufflers, sending letters back and forth to give the impression that we are trying to be of assistance to a constituent, regardless of the subject matter, in the hope we might get their vote. The logic of Deputy Molloy's approach is that not only would he make such representations at the behest of somebody who is sending him letters in favour of a convicted rapist, he would also do so at the behest of somebody who thought an axe murderer should be released. It is an extraordinary way to conduct politics.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said on Friday that the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, did nothing wrong other than telling his secretary to make contact with the judicial system. He said he knew there had been an exchange of letters and that the Minister of State need not resign. This is particularly curious because the Tánaiste said on Friday that she did not know about the exchange of letters or the detail of the letters. How did the Taoiseach know about them when the Tánaiste did not? If the Taoiseach knew about them, why did he not make the moral judgment that the letter sent in early November seeking this man's temporary release or at least giving the impression that Deputy Molloy supported the sister's request for temporary release was highly inappropriate?</P>
    <P>What about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? He is accusing people of making charges against him which are not being made. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a difficulty which he has not adequately explained. He said in his first statement that for the sake of completeness he was making reference to correspondence between himself and Deputy Molloy. There was reference to an exchange of two letters. The following day we discovered there were 15 letters. The Minister still has not published his internal departmental memos. His explanation for that was that he did not know about those letters. His explanation today is that he frequently signs letters about subjects he knows nothing about because of the volume of correspondence that comes into the Department. We now know that the official in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who telephoned the judge was within the same section of the Department that was dealing with some of this correspondence.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister clarify whether there is or why there is not a system for tracking correspondence in his Department? It was understood that this had been put in place. It should have been easy to discover the existence of the total correspondence at an early stage. Does the Minister accept any accountability for letters he signs as Minister? He is accountable to this House for the manner in which he runs his Department. Are representations about serious issues to the Mini<Col N="68" /> ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform nothing more than a charade for Members of this House to engage in, assuming that a serious issue will have the eye of the Minister when it never goes any further than a civil servant in his Department and the Minister will sign any old reply without having to check the substance of the issue? Is this Minister in charge of his Department or is he just a place sitter, hanging in there until the next election?</P>
    <P>Given the volume of correspondence that took place, the phone calls from Deputy Molloy's office to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's office, Deputy Molloy's various meetings with Ann Naughton and his clear involvement in this matter, I do not believe it is credible that these two Ministers, who sat in Cabinet together, did not on a single occasion exchange words about this issue. If they did not, it says something about the manner in which this Government works and that the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, without making moral judgments or decisions was engaged in a game of charades with his constituent. Perhaps he was pretending to his constituent that he had a concern but it was a heck of a pretence about an issue of huge importance. If he had been successful in the representations he was making and if he had secured the temporary release of Patrick Naughton, would he not have sent a letter to Ann Naughton claiming credit for it? Had he any regard to the victim when he was doing this and had the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform any regard to the victim when he participated in this correspondence by signing a myriad of letters about which he says he knows nothing?</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting a number of sentences which are particularly apposite. &ldquo;The Minister's speech contained a tremendous amount of obfuscation. It was an attempt to construct a smokescreen around this sorry saga and a blatant effort to ensure that the Minister for Justice would escape accountability and responsibility&rdquo; for the nature of the correspondence he chose to engage in and for his failure to fully reveal the correspondence initially last week. &ldquo;The Minister has blamed the officials in [his] Department . . . Who in this Government of so-called openness, transparency and accountability will accept responsibility and accountability for this . . .?&rdquo; Will the Taoiseach accept any accountability for his failed moral judgments last week and his failure to acknowledge the wrong the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, did to the victim in this case by the nature of the correspondence he conducted? Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform accept that he is not a Minister with responsibility for justice if he does not know what is being done in his Department and if he is signing letters about whose contents he knows nothing?</P>
    <P>The final quote is: &ldquo;The Minister must carry the major responsibility for the matter because of its grave seriousness, because [he] is charged with the administration of [his] Department and <Col N="69" /> because it is [his] duty to ensure that serious decisions are implemented&rdquo;. It is the Minister's duty to ensure serious issues &ndash; this was a very serious one &ndash; are addressed seriously. It is he who is accountable to the House for an improper telephone call made by his official to a judge of the High Court. He failed to note in the speech he made this evening that not only did the official seek to check the judge's office telephone number, but, as the judge confirmed, improperly sought the judge's home telephone number.</P>
    <P>The quotes to which I have referred regarding accountability, responsibility and transparency are taken from a speech delivered by the Minister when in opposition on 7 November 1996. He is not even able to live up to the standards which he himself prescribed for others and for which he criticised them if he determined they did not meet them. He made that speech in the context of one letter getting lost somewhere within the then Department of Justice. He managed to lose 15 and sign nine about a subject about which he knew nothing on his own account.</P>

      <P>Nobody likes to see a colleague in the House forced to resign from Government, but in the nature and extent of his representations on behalf of the sister of Mr. Naughton, Deputy Molloy made a serious error of judgment. All of us in the House receive representations from constituents and others on a wide variety of matters. All of us have an obligation to show some degree of judgment and discretion in determining the extent to which we wish to be associated, even indirectly, with certain matters. There are times when a public representative simply needs to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was not a case of a constituent in trouble for failing to tax a car or forgetting to return a form or even the case of a young person in trouble with the law for the first time who might deserve a second chance. This was a case of a father involved in the most monstrous sexual abuse and rape of his own daughter over a period of ten years. Despite the appalling nature of the case, Deputy Molloy continued to make representations on his behalf, even going so far as to make an inquiry about the possibility of temporary release, after he had been convicted. This, in itself, would have been a serious error of judgment. He then compounded the error by asking that contact be made with a judge hearing a most important and sensitive case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has paid a high price through the loss of his ministerial office, but we must never forget that the principal victim by far in <Col N="70" /> this affair has been the young woman subjected to such abuse, who had her childhood stolen from her and was let down by the failure of the relevant institutions to detect the abuse and intervene on her behalf.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many questions also for the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Why the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste did not recognise on Tuesday what they apparently now accept, that Deputy Molloy's actions merited resignation, is one such question. Let us be clear about it. Were it not for the second intervention of Mr. Justice O'Sullivan on Wednesday morning to dispute the Government spin the public would be none the wiser.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday it was Mr. Justice O'Sullivan who first brought to the attention of the public the improper approaches that had been made to him. It was the same judge who, in an event probably without precedent in the history of our judicial system, returned to his court the following day to give the full version of events, following the selective disclosure made by the Government the previous day. Deputy Molloy may have sinned, but the smokescreen erected around it by Government since the story emerged has been considerable.</P>
    <P>The role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this affair has been considerable. There was lengthy correspondence over a period of more than one year, yet, if he is to be believed, at no stage did he question or raise with Deputy Molloy the appropriateness of making representations in this case. He spent last week denying a charge, which certainly the Opposition was not making against him and which I am not making against him now. Nobody is accusing him of attempting to influence the outcome of the court case, although he must accept political responsibility for what Mr. Justice O'Sullivan described as a totally improper approach from the Minister's office in which the judge's home telephone number was sought. What he does stand accused of, however, is failing to deal with this matter fully, openly and honestly when it emerged and to disclose important public information until it was forced out of him. His attempts to deal with this affair and stand over the spin put on events by the Government on Wednesday are simply incredible. I firmly believe that the Government's refusal to allow an independent investigation in this matter has a lot to do with the fact that the Minister's story simply does not add up.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the facts. A major news story breaks on Tuesday about the possible involvement of a Minister of State in improper contacts with a judge. The Government, including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, goes into crisis management mode, yet from that time on Tuesday morning we are asked to believe that it took over two days to trace correspondence from Deputy Molloy to the office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; representations all <Col N="71" /> handled by the Minister's office from the same Minister of State and dealing with the same constituent. One does not need to be an expert on databases to know that even before the computer age a half competent filing system should be able to deal with that problem. In an age of electronic databases it beggars belief. However, it is on this thread of absolute incompetence that the Minister's story hangs and even still one might be prepared to grant him a fool's pardon were subsequent events and statements from him not so specifically designed to detract attention from his failings.</P>
    <P>For example, why would anybody describe a statement they issue on Wednesday evening to be &ldquo;for the purpose of completeness,&rdquo; if they seek to claim later that a trawl for correspondence was under way? Why would such a statement make reference to two letters that establish in respect of any possible charge of interference in the judicial process the Minister acted properly, yet not disclose that the letters in question were being handled by the same and, as I understand it, small section of the Department dealing with Deputy Molloy's representations?</P>
    <P>Were it not for the Freedom of Information Act introduced by the Labour Party and the 28 day deadline which would have placed the time of disclosure close to election day for the responses that it entails, I do not believe we would have seen the other letters at all. The refusal by the press office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to release the letters to journalists from &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on the very morning they were to be eventually published lends credibility to that interpretation, yet even then it took another 24 hours to determine that the release of correspondence on Thursday evening was not complete, although there is guarded reference to it in the Minister's statement on Thursday. We still do not know what was in the letters withheld, but these may be central to a full understanding of this affair.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement of Thursday, 11 April, read:</P>
    <P>The Minister does not believe that it would be right to publish material containing personal information about private individuals or comments which have to do with the merits of the Court case as the merits of the case have now been the subject of adjudication by the Courts.</P>
    <P>This clearly means that the Minister received correspondence which contained personal information about individuals and commented on the merits of the court case. It is only reasonable to infer that these matters were contained in correspondence from the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. On Friday last, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform told RTE that two letters from Deputy Molloy had been withheld for legal reasons. If correspondence from Deputy Molloy did make comments on the merits of the <Col N="72" /> court case, then his action was even more ill-judged than we originally thought.</P>
    <P>The public is entitled to the full story, not the partial version that is being prised out in dribs and drabs from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I do not accept the Minister's contention that comments to do with the merits of the court case should not be published, because the court has now adjudicated. Surely, if Deputy Molloy or anyone else sought to cast doubt on the merits of the case, we are entitled to know about it. I find it absolutely incredible that this drip-feed of information amounts to a disclosure by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of information in good faith. It is more likely that what happened here is a cover-up that was aborted. The refusal of the Government and the Taoiseach to allow an independent inquiry only strengthens my suspicions. Last week I pointed to a model that could be used to ensure that all these matters were cleared up without further delay.</P>
    <P>There are some parallels between aspects of this affair and the Judge Dominic Lynch controversy of 1996, when officials in the Department of Justice were alleged to have failed to pass on information regarding the delisting of a judge from the judicial panel authorised to sit in the Special Criminal Court. On that occasion the Rainbow Government appointed two prominent individuals &ndash; a former senior civil servant, Mr. Sean Cromien, and an independent consultant, Dr. Edmond Molloy &ndash; to examine all aspects of the affair and to consider what procedural changes should be made in the light of their inquiry. The two completed their report in little more than a week and made a number of significant recommendations regarding administrative and procedural improvements to ensure that such an error would not happen again. There is no reason why a similarly speedy investigation could not be undertaken into this murky affair. There are many questions left unanswered. There are many documents we need to see and only on their release will the story of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stand up.</P>
    <P>In a statement I issued yesterday I listed the information and the items we need to see, and I now challenge the Minister to release this material, namely, the two letters that appear to come from Deputy Molloy which were omitted from disclosure to date, edited if necessary to delete any defamatory material; the acknowledgements of Deputy O'Donoghue to these two letters; the file covers relating to Deputy Molloy's correspondence and phone calls, indicating to whom the files were passed and when; a copy of any legal advice from Michael McDowell SC, Attorney General, which justifies the withholding of the material that has been withheld to date. If no such advice exists, it would be extraordinary that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would seek to withhold vital documents based on legal advice without seeking such advice from the Attorney General; the files contained in <Col N="73" /> the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Deputy Dempsey now has legal responsibility for these files and he too must make them public immediately. He must also make a detailed and comprehensive statement on the involvement of his Department and its personnel in the affair; the internal papers of the courts division, that is, any documents other than those letters already published, dealing with the Molloy letters and phone calls; the reply by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to Deputy Molloy's last letter, which would have been generated on foot of the letter from the courts service of 15 March 2002; the enclosures sent by Deputy Molloy, that is, the letters from Mr. Naughton's sister, edited if necessary to delete defamatory material; an indication from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to how many people in the courts division dealt with Deputy Molloy's correspondence, the number of officials within the Department and the full contents of the division file on the matter; and a copy of the printout of the file-tracking system used to identify the Molloy correspondence. This printout is vital because it will establish whether the claim that the correspondence was discovered in a piecemeal manner is credible or not. We must also have details of when the alleged further trawl was ordered, how long it took to complete and the manner in which it was carried out.</P>
    <P>I congratulate, if that is the right word, the Government on its successful spinning campaign on Saturday last when every journalist in Dublin was led to believe that a story would break involving similar representations to those made by Deputy Molloy involving either myself and the leader of Fine Gael. To their credit, most journalists were not taken in by the spin. These stories did not emerge because they do not exist. However, the Government's spin machine is probably capable of inferring culpability from far less serious representations. That it chose not to do so is probably to do with the fact that what might have applied to either myself or Deputy Noonan would also have had to go for the Taoiseach, and for some reason it was decided that would not do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the victim in this case for any distress that my actions may have caused her. I am deeply sorry that actions taken by me in good faith, without any ill intention towards her, may have compounded her pain by bringing greater publicity and public controversy to the trial and sentence of her father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also apologise to Mr. Justice O'Sullivan. I am deeply sorry that a course of action which I initiated in good faith with no ill will or wrong motive towards him or the criminal process has resulted in his believing, as he obviously did, that a deliberate attempt had been made to influence or affect him in the discharge of his constitutional and judicial functions. I hope that both the victim and Mr. Justice O'Sullivan can accept my word that I never, at any time, intended to affect the <Col N="74" /> outcome of the prosecution of Patrick Naughton, with regard to the verdict or the sentence.</P>
    <P>As a father, I would never seek to prevent the conviction or imprisonment of a person who had savagely defiled his own child. I never took any steps with the intention of doing so. I ask my colleagues in this House to accept that my motive was to help the constituent who was distressed and who was seeking information regarding the judicial procedures, rather than to pretend to her that I could use my public office to affect the outcome of her brother's case.</P>
    <P>When I forwarded to Anne Naughton the responses of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of 13 April and 31 May, I informed her by letter on 15 June that &ldquo;there is no further assistance that I can give you in the above matter.&rdquo; Anne Naughton apparently accepted that this was the case and had no further contact with me until after her brother's conviction.</P>
    <P>No fair-minded reading of the letters I sent suggests that I ever tried to influence the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to adopt any course in respect of Patrick Naughton or his prosecution. I have been accused of persistently and tenaciously seeking to secure the release of Patrick Naughton over many months. I did not do so. The record shows that I never made any such attempt or request in any shape or form, nor did I ever pretend to Anne Naughton that I was doing so. The persons who made those accusations against me obviously never read what I wrote and relied, I can only assume, on other people's impressions of the letters' contents.</P>
    <P>It was in October 2001, after Patrick Naughton's conviction and while he was awaiting sentence, that his sister returned to me inquiring whether he had to remain in prison until an appeal was heard or if he could be remanded on bail on the same terms as he had been remanded pending trail. She also wanted to know when the case would be finalised and when an appeal would be dealt with.</P>
    <P>On 6 November 2001, I passed on Anne Naughton's queries to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the belief that they were, in her mind, legitimate questions for her to ask. Again, in relaying her questions to the Minister, I was in no way attempting to influence the judicial process or to secure Mr. Naughton's release. On 31 January 2002, the Minister replied explaining that Patrick Naughton was in custody on foot of court warrants. He explained that the timing of an appeal was a matter for the courts and reiterated that the courts were independent and that he was precluded from commenting or intervening in any way. I fully endorse his response. His comments were nonetheless helpful to Ann Naughton in understanding the legal process. I received a further letter from her on 23 January 2002 which I forwarded to the Minister on 31 January. This letter inquired about an appeal date. The Minister acknowledged receipt of it on 7 February 2002.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" />Ann Naughton rang my Dublin office on 12 March 2002 saying she had now written to the judge and asking if I could establish if he had received her correspondence as she had not received an acknowledgement. I wrote a note on the typed note for my staff member who took her call. It stated: &ldquo;Can we ring judge's secretary and inquire if he has received the letter mentioned above?&rdquo; I never saw her letter to the judge.</P>
    <P>Ann Naughton telephoned again on 19 March asking if we had found out if the judge's office had received her correspondence. The staff member in my office who took the call telephoned the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seeking a telephone number for the judge's secretary. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already detailed what happened, unfortunately, on foot of this request.</P>
    <P>When my staff member rang the number provided, the judge, as we know, answered the telephone. He explained to her that her request was improper and terminated the telephone call immediately. I wish to make it clear that I never requested my staff member to ring the judge directly, nor did she seek to do so. I never asked her to speak to the judge or seek the judge's home telephone number, as was suggested in newspaper reports of the judge's initial comments. This, of course, has since been clarified by the judge. When the conversation with the judge was reported to me, I advised the official verbally, and recorded on the note of her conversation with the judge, as follows: &ldquo;Never, ever approach a judge directly about any case he is involved in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I assure the House that there was nothing sinister or dishonest in my actions in this matter at any stage. I also assure the House that at no time did I have any personal contact with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whose conduct in this matter was and is above reproach. The same applies to the officials in his Department and also the official in my Department who made the telephone call. I regret very much that conspiracy theorists have suggested otherwise. At all times, the Minister and his Department acted in good faith and entirely properly.</P>
    <P>The sequence of events which led to telephone calls being made to the trial judge was very unfortunate. I agree that I was mistaken in thinking that the judge had a secretary. I was wrong to think that even if he had a secretary it would ever have been appropriate to make an inquiry of that secretary as to whether the judge had received a letter, but ask the House to take my word that I never tried to have contact made with the judge. I would never have dreamed of initiating such contact and would have stopped it if I thought it was happening. Nor would I have asked to contact the judge at home. That topic can only have arisen because a well meaning official in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who did not know the reason my office was seeking to contact the judge, was trying to be helpful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" />Clearly, the two telephone calls to the judge created in the judge's mind a disturbing impression that an attempt was being made to make improper contact with him about the case with which he was dealing. I deeply regret that a judge, for whom I have the highest respect, should have been put in this position. I hope he will accept my word when I say that the contact made with him was unintended and accidental, and that no underhand motive lay behind it.</P>
    <P>For my part, I know there are occasions when perceptions are as important as objective truth. One of those occasions is the administration of justice where, as the maxim puts it, justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. Given the perceived impropriety of the contacts in the judge's mind, it was correct that he would seek to establish on the public record that they had not affected him in any way. It is for these reasons that the circumstances which came about made it appropriate for me to resign. I realised, on a few hours' reflection, that because of a human error of judgment on my part, the public might have been given the impression that I had secretly tried to influence a judge.</P>
    <P>I also realise that while I had not done so, the contrary impression created in the mind of a judge and the public would make it impossible for me to remain in office protesting that my error was simply made in good faith and unintentionally. I ask my colleagues in Leinster House to accept that I acted throughout only in good faith and with good intentions. I ask them also to take my word that none of my actions was underhand or dishonest.</P>
    <P>I have served the people of Galway for 37 years to the best of my ability and, as far as I could, in a manner in which a politician should do so. I have always tried to live up to basic standards of decency and honesty which the people are entitled to expect in their representatives. Like everyone else, I have made errors of judgment during the years but ask my colleagues to accept that the circumstances which led to my resignation did not arise from any conscious departure by me from those standards. Those events were unintended in their happening and outcome. They were well motivated. They were innocent of the darker explanations which some have offered for them.</P>
    <P>Resignation is a heavy price to pay for a public representative with 37 years' service. Resignation with dishonour, however, would be too high a price to pay because I know that I have acted at all times in good faith. For that reason, I make this statement to the House in the hope and belief that my word will be taken that these events are free of any conspiracy, bad faith or underhand motives. I have resigned an office which I was honoured to hold because I know that failing to do so would have damaged public confidence in all that I hold dear &ndash; public confidence in decent standards in public life, the rule of law, impartial justice and, particularly, the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" />I thank all Members of the House for their friendship during the years and the staff of the various Departments of State in which I have served for their kind and dedicated service, support and commitment. I thank my constituents in Galway who have re-elected me continuously in every general election since 1965. I thank the Progressive Democrats organisation in Galway West and nationally. I thank the public generally, my friends and, above all, my family for the kindness and support they have shown to me during all my public life, in particular in recent days.</P>

      <P>This debate is a cause of sadness, particularly for the victim of this appalling abuse, but also, as we have heard, for Deputy Molloy. It is also a cause of major concern as it relates to a cornerstone of the Constitution, namely, the independence of the Judiciary from the Executive. It appears that the lessons from the Sheedy affair about the nature and extent of political representations have yet to be learned, not just by the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, but by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>These representations are formally acknowledged by staff in my office and passed on to the relevant sections of my Department for attention and for the preparation of replies. Replies are signed by me or on my behalf, but rarely would I have time personally to study the detail of such representations or replies, given the overall volume involved.</P>
      <P>The time is long overdue when representations which jeopardise or may jeopardise the separation of the Executive from the Judiciary should be ruled out of order. The Ceann Comhairle, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle well knows, has a well-established practice when replying to all Deputies who attempt to put a parliamentary question that is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let this sorry saga at least result in the introduction by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of measures which will avoid a repetition of this debacle. Any representation relating to a court case ought to be acknowledged with a warning about the need not to interfere in any way with due judicial process. It is shocking that this should occur after Deputy Molloy's 37 years of experience as a TD and Minister and this highlights that this warning cannot be repeated too often. The shock is compounded by the fact that Deputy O'Donoghue, as a solicitor as well as a Minister, knows the seriousness of the Sheedy affair and knows the further seriousness of this case. Yet in his speech he did not make reference to the need for reform within his Department. The flaws in the system which came to light during the Sheedy affair have now been further exacerbated by this lack of reform in the Depart<Col N="78" /> ment. This sorry saga should probably be called the Shoddy affair.</P>

      <P>Our first thoughts in this debate must be with the victim of the horrific crime at the centre of this controversy. She suffered years of torture and humiliation at the hands of her father but had the courage to proceed with a criminal prosecution of her abuser and, as with others who have taken this course in recent years, her bravery will surely have encouraged more victims to come forward and ensure that their abusers are brought to justice. It is the horrific nature of this case that makes it baffling and incredible that Deputy Molloy persisted in his repeated representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on behalf of the sister of the abuser. It is equally baffling that calls were made from Deputy Molloy's office to the judge's chambers.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that when this matter first arose, the Tánaiste said that it was an administrative clerical error and a mistake. The Taoiseach also said it was an error and not a resigning matter. Yet within hours, the Minister of State had resigned. We then had the release of letters from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Time does not permit me to give a more detailed view of the sequence of events and all their implications but the key point is that the full truth was most definitely not being told from the outset and that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform released correspondence under the threat of a freedom of information request. We do not know Deputy Molloy's motivation for making these repeated representations but we should be told. The victim, at least, is deserving of a full explanation. It is too soon to reach firm conclusions: we need not only more information but all the information held by all involved in this affair. It should be done in a way that shows sensitivity to the victim and enhances the practice of politics.</P>
      <P>Mar nóta deiridh, ba mhaith liom a rá go raibh an Teachta Molloy béasach liom i gcónaí ar an leibhéal pearsanta, agus é ina Aire Stáit. Deputy Molloy was always courteous to me on a personal level and aside from our recorded engagements, both in this House and at meetings of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, I have always believed him to be a decent and honourable man and I bear him no ill will. That said, this matter must be addressed comprehensively and with full transparency.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that he was initially apprised on the morning of Wednesday, 10 April, of the correspondence. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was subject to criticism in the High Court by a senior judge on the previous day. Did the Minister not ask his private office about that matter on the day that a colleague who sat at Cabinet was publicly criticised for improper conduct by a High Court judge? Did any member of the staff of the Minister's private office allude to the fact that there was ongoing and voluminous correspondence on this matter in his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the tracking system that exists in the Minister's office subsequent to the Cromien investigation &ndash; it is a matter of record in the House that all correspondence to the Minister is logged in his office &ndash; is it credible that a minis<Col N="81" /> terial colleague's correspondence would not have been identified immediately? Why did the Minister use the phrase &ldquo;for completeness&rdquo; when referring to two items of correspondence on the Wednesday if, as he now states, that at that stage an ongoing trawl was taking place in his Department for further correspondence of which he was aware? How is it that correspondence handled by his office from the same ministerial colleague on the same matter concerning the same case would not have been kept in the same file?</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of why I did not check the matter on the Tuesday, the reality is that all I knew was that there had been contact by an official in Deputy Molloy's office with a judge and that he was in some difficulty over it.

All of the efforts in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform were concentrated in the courts division in order to ascertain whether there had been any improper conduct. It was in the course of that investigation that the documents referred to in the Wednesday statement were located in the courts division.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In the statement we were dealing with the central thrust of this matter, namely, whether there was improper conduct by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, for which I would be accountable. It has been established, beyond any question of a doubt, that there was no improper conduct in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that its officials are entirely blameless and that they acted at all times in good faith. Since the officials acted at all times in good faith and were blameless, blame or mala fides could not then surely be ascribed to me.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the ongoing correspondence, there was such correspondence but each reply to Deputy Molloy was essentially in the same terms: &ldquo;I cannot interfere with the Judiciary in the exercise of their functions&rdquo;. That is a reply that is issued to everyone.</P>

Deputies opposite know that to be the case; they know it is an absolute fact.</P>
      <P>Is it credible that a colleague's correspondence would not have been identified? The reality is that I was never proactive, at any stage, on the file. I did not act on the file at all.

      <P>If the Deputy wants copies of file covers he can certainly have them. There are now within the Department myriad freedom of information requests about all political representations for the past number of years. Work is ongoing in terms of collating all of this information in response to those requests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have four questions for the Minister. Is he now telling us that the tracking system is so badly organised that it is not useable to track representations received in relation to specific cases? The Minister stated that there is no record of correspondence, either locally in Galway or in the Galway divisional headquarters, between Deputy Molloy and the Garda Síochána. Has he inquired as to whether there are records of any description of any other contacts between Deputy Molloy and gardaí in Galway in respect of this case?</P>
      <P>The Minister informed the House that on the Wednesday he was only aware of two letters that had been exchanged and that he discovered the 15 on the Thursday. If that is the case, will he explain why the Taoiseach, in justifying his defence of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on Tuesday evening and in retrospectively explaining it to <i>The Irish Times</i> on Friday, stated that he knew there had been an exchange of letters on Tuesday night? According to the remarks he made, the Taoiseach, when he stated that Deputy Molloy should not resign, had full knowledge of the letters the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says he only discovered on the Thursday. Either the Taoiseach's recollection or the Minister's is not accurate. Assuming the Minister is being truthful and correct, will he explain why the Taoiseach told various journalists that he was aware of all this correspondence on Tuesday evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a final question on a matter which has remained something of a mystery throughout this affair. Most of the queries the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, raised with the Minister <Col N="84" /> related to when the trial would take place, why Ann Naughton's brother was being held in custody, why he was not being released from custody and when an appeal would take place. I find it difficult to understand that the former Minister of State did not simply ask his constituent to contact her brother's solicitor who, as the person representing him in the criminal proceedings, should have been able to provide answers to all her questions. Perhaps the Minister will explain the reason this common sense advice was not given to the former Minister of State in addition to his quite proper advice that he could not interfere in the matter. Considering the persistence of the correspondence, did it not occur to the Minister or anyone in the Department to ask the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to advise Ann Naughton to raise her questions with her brother's solicitor?</P>

      <P>It was late on Wednesday that further correspondence was discovered in the crime and prisons division. Naturally, on the second occasion I wanted to be absolutely certain that we had all the documentation which should be put into the public domain. I issued my statement on Thursday when I was satisfied that this was the position. I informed the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach on the Thursday of this additional information and of my intention to place it in the public domain.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked why Deputy Molloy did not tell his constituent to approach her brother's solicitor. The Deputy is also a solicitor, yet he chose to write to me in relation to a constituent. Why did he not tell his constituent to visit his solicitor?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three further questions for the Minister. In relation to the much talked about tracking system, is the Minister informing the House that the volume of correspondence he has received from a colleague at Cabinet, former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is such that it <Col N="85" /> was not possible in a day to see a complete compendium of representations on the matter? Will he confirm that his own office had a record of all these letters on the tracking system?</P>
      <P>The sequence of correspondence for this year &ndash; I will not go through the whole history of the case &ndash; is that former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, wrote to the Minister on 31 January. The letter was referred by the Minister to the courts division and acknowledged to the Minister of State on 7 February. This acknowledgement was also referred to the courts division, which faxed the Courts Service seeking information on the case in question on 12 February. On 15 February the Courts Service wrote back to the courts policy division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform stating that the details of the case were insufficient. Four days later, after this extensive involvement by four named officials of a small division in the Department, an official of the courts division telephoned Mr. Justice Philip O'Sullivan on 19 March. Given the number of officials who had dealt with the correspondence, the faxes to the Courts Service and the preparation of a reply which, at that time, was in train in the courts division, is it credible that the official who made the telephone call had no knowledge of the issues at the heart of the query from the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy's office, despite the fact that all around him officials in his division were responding or gathering information to respond to these very queries?</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter quoted the Minister's response during the Judge Dominic Lynch controversy in 1996 when, in Opposition, he demanded the resignation of the Minister for Justice for failing to keep track of one item of correspondence. What shred of credibility does he now have in not applying those same standards to himself?</P>

      <P>Yes. In regard to the question of whether the official who telephoned the judge had knowledge of the case because he was working in the courts division, the position is that when the call from the former Minister of State, <Col N="86" /> Deputy Molloy's office came into my office, the person calling on behalf of the former Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, stated she was telephoning in relation to the possibility of contacting Mr. Justice O'Sullivan's secretary to find out about correspondence in relation to a person called Ann Naughton. The official in my office had no idea what it was about and merely telephoned an official in the courts division to say he needed the number of Mr. Justice O'Sullivan for the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy. The official in the courts division did not know anything about the conversation between the official from Deputy Molloy's office and the official in my office, other than that Mr. Justice O'Sullivan's number was required, which he proceeded to seek. In any event, as will be clear from the file, that official is not the official who dealt with the inquiry in relation to Ann Naughton in the courts division.</P>

      <P>There is a major difference between this case and the issue of Judge Dominic Lynch. I will explain it if the Deputy will allow me to do so. On 1 August 1996 a Cabinet meeting decided that Judge Dominic Lynch should be delisted as a judge of the Special Criminal Court at his own request. On 9 August that decision was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. On 6 November, a full 14 weeks later, prisoners were released. There was correspondence from the Attorney General to the Minister, Deputy Owen, in the intervening period. The High Court, not I, referred to &ldquo;a lamentable catalogue of errors&rdquo;. One politician in this House stated that Deputy Owen's position would be untenable if any prisoners were released. That politician was the then Tánaiste and the Labour Party's former leader, Deputy Spring. The Deputy should not try to make a comparison between this case where officials were entirely blameless and the delisting of a judge in the Special Criminal Court. Officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform acted in good faith. They are entirely blameless and so am I.</P>

The matter was dealt with in an exemplary and text book fashion.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of seeking release, Deputy Molloy sent on correspondence from Ms Ann Naughton. In addition, he sent the letter to which Deputy Jim Higgins referred and there are words blacked out in that letter. The words are blacked out for legal reasons, not because there is anything to hide or because anything would shed any light on the situation from his perspective. In other words, there is nothing sinister about that. In as much as the correspondence which was received from Ms Ann Naughton was deemed not to be publishable, so too the sentence which has been blocked out in Deputy Molloy's letter.</P>

      <P>conscious of the fear prevailing in the country following the most recent increase in violent deaths, and aware of the need to restore a sense of security on our streets,</P>
      <P>noting that six people died violently in the past week alone, including two members of the Garda Síochána in the course of their duty,</P>
      <P>noting that there has been an increase of 131% in assaults causing harm in the year 2000, and</P>
      <P>aware that the Government's refusal to accept the reality of the astounding increase in street violence has allowed a situation to develop whereby only one in four assaults are reported to the gardaí, </P>
      <P>condemns this Government for allowing zero tolerance to become zero action in relation to street violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" />I wish to share time with Deputies Coveney, Allen and Crawford, by agreement. The last seven or eight days have been a particularly appalling period in relation to street violence. We have already today paid tribute to the two brave members of the Garda Síochána who lost their lives at the weekend, the funeral of one of whom was attended by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, other Members of the House and I today. Over the past week, four people have been killed on the streets of Dublin. There have been numerous stabbings, shootings and assaults. Street violence has now reached epidemic proportions.</P>
    <P>For over two years in this House, the Fine Gael party has raised the escalating problem of street violence and has put pressure on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address the problem. He has continued to ignore it. Five years ago, this Minister spoke of zero tolerance. He took the phrase from New York. There, the concept of zero tolerance was used in circumstances where people were fearful to walk the streets, particularly at night but in some areas by day, for fear of grievous assault. Gangs gathered on street corners, assaulting innocent people, creating mayhem and murder on the streets and making life intolerable, not only for those who lived in New York, but for those who visited it.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; to give the impression that, should he be returned to Government and should he be appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he would solve problems of public order on our streets that do not remotely resemble the serious state that has been reached five years into his term of office. Zero tolerance was about making the streets safe at a time when no one would deny there were difficulties. However, those difficulties pale into insignificance in the context of what the citizens of this country are currently confronted with in every town and city.</P>
    <P>Zero tolerance was a cynical and cute election slogan which has proved utterly meaningless. Rather than applying the concept of zero tolerance, the Minister has shown zero capacity to even acknowledge the extent of the problem. While he has been paralysed by inaction and glorying in self-praise and self-justification, people are being bludgeoned on the streets of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and the towns of Ireland. Young men are being kicked senseless late at night by drunken gangs. Gangs of drunken youths now play a game in Dublin where they take turns in attacking people to see, with one kick, how many teeth they can kick out of a person lying on the ground. If one member of the gang only kicks three teeth out, the same gang will later attack someone else innocently walking the streets and a mate of the first guy will see if another kick is more effective.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage where 95% of those living in Dublin city and county believe it is unsafe to walk alone in the city centre at night. <Col N="92" /> Similar numbers of people in Cork, Limerick and Galway, when surveyed by the Fine Gael Party in an entirely objective survey, have given the same answer. Some 70% of people do not feel safe walking alone in their own communities at night. There is genuine fear on the streets of our cities and towns. This Minister has ignored what is happening and has utterly failed to address the problem.</P>
    <P>When this issue was raised by the Fine Gael Party in a motion some months ago, the Minister defended his position. We listened to a lengthy speech on his achievements and on how he was the best Minister in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform since the foundation of the State, and probably the best Minister for Justice on the entire planet, in the context of comparing his achievements with any country in any part of the world since time began. No doubt, we will hear the same glorious speech tonight in which he will engage in an orgy of personal back-slapping and self-congratulation.</P>
    <P>No one outside this House believes that this Minister has done the job he was elected to do. The overwhelming majority of people believe that the Government should long ago have taken action to make our streets safe. They do not believe that a Government, which has all of a sudden acknowledged the problem and announced makeshift solutions when confronted by a general election and the horrendous events of recent days, has any real intention of doing anything or has any credibility.</P>
    <P>It was many months ago in this House that I called for more gardaí on the beat and for a more visible Garda presence on our streets and in local communities to act as a deterrent to crime and particularly to the gratuitous street assaults taking place. On that occasion, I spoke of the plight of three people visiting this country whose lives had been destroyed when assaulted on our streets. The Minister defended himself. He told us about Operation Oíche and how it was solving the problem. Of course, when Operation Oíche did not solve the problem and violence continued to escalate, and when two young men were lying unconscious in the same hospital in Cork following vicious attacks within days of each other in Cork city, the Minister announced Operation Encounter, the sister or brother of Operation Oíche. The Minister now makes the same claims for Operation Encounter that he made for Operation Oíche.</P>
    <P>The only difference between the two operations is the name. Even gardaí are cynical. At the conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors just a few days ago, the general secretary was anxious to say in his speech that he was concerned that Operation Encounter was simply a short-term public relations exercise. That is exactly what it is. The name has more to do with the &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; television programme than with any coherent, comprehensive policy to tackle the problems of street violence.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael wants to see a more visible presence of gardaí on the beat. We want to see Garda cars <Col N="93" /> specially reinforced to ensure that gardaí cannot be injured and attacked by youths who hijack motor cars and use them as weapons to attack members of the force. We want the greatly expanded use of CCTV. In reply to Dáil questions some 18 months ago, the Minister said that there was to be great expansion of the use of CCTV as a means of preventing and detecting crime.</P>
    <P>In 2001, the princely sum of £33,000 was spent by the Minister in extending CCTV coverage. We are now told that the Minister will spend &euro;15 million in the next three years but nobody believes that. It is a figure devised with the election in view to give the pretence that something meaningful is happening in that area when nothing is happening. I have heard the Minister say at committee meetings and in this Chamber that he has built prisons and solved the revolving door problem. We still have a revolving door policy which directly affects the level of violence on our streets. Young teenage bootboys and hooligans come before the courts on charges of assault whom the Judiciary wants to hold on remand in custody pending trial but cannot because we have in total 31 remand places to serve children under 16 who are engaged in vicious and violent assaults on our streets. Far more remand centre places are needed. There are young people engaged in car hijacking and murderous assaults who would be held on remand if the places were available but they do not exist.</P>
    <P>Heavier penalties are needed for those engaged in street violence. More comprehensive diversion programmes to identify juveniles in trouble are required because these juveniles are the potential attackers of innocent victims. The problem of truancy must be tackled. Within certain schools in our cities, 20% of pupils miss school and they will end up engaging in violent crime and gratuitously assaulting innocent passers-by. This Government has utterly and totally failed to address this issue.</P>
    <P>This motion condemns the Government for allowing zero tolerance to become zero action in relation to street violence. What is needed is a new and different approach. We do not need more public relations announcements with high-faluting names given to the latest Garda operation designed to last only a few weeks and to get the Minister out of political difficulty. This motion is not about political point-scoring; it is about making our streets safe for ordinary men and women so they can feel safe walking at night.</P>
    <P>The Garda require additional resources to do the job properly and for which they continually cry out. In the context of crime detection and of pursuing criminals, they remain under-resourced. The helicopter fleet given to the Garda to assist in fighting crime does not fly at night in parts of the country and is not available at weekends. Do those engaged in violence cherry-pick when they are going to attack or when they are going to hijack cars and use them as a weapon to destroy the lives of others? Our Garda needs extra <Col N="94" /> resources. The community wants to see a more visible presence of gardaí on the streets. We want to see CCTV working in our towns and cities to assist in providing protection and detection. We want to ensure that juveniles charged with serious assault can be held on remand pending trial and are not returned to the streets to prey on new victims and commit further offences.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this Minister realises the extent to which he has lost credibility in the eyes of the general public. The Taoiseach yesterday suddenly acknowledged that there is a problem of violent crime and that the Government must do something. That sounds incredible coming from a Government that has done nothing about street violence for the last five years. It has sat back and complacently watched the level of violence escalate to a degree never seen before in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak yet again on the issue of street violence and crime and the fear factor that has developed among both young and old. There is no doubt that Ireland has become a more violent place over the last few years. Between 1999 and 2000 there was an increase of 131% in the number of violent attacks. In 2001, 3,500 people were detained overnight in Dublin hospitals because they had been violently attacked or assaulted in the capital. The fear factor among both young and elderly people has increased dramatically. In today's<i> Irish Examiner</i>, a representative of a group for elderly people says that many of its members now sleep during the day; they are afraid to go asleep at night because of anti-social behaviour in their neighbourhoods. Groups like Victim Support are at the coalface of this problem. They note that the reporting of serious crime and assaults is decreasing dramatically. Only about one third of assaults are being reported to the Garda. Accident and emergency consultants in Cork city agree with these statistics.</P>
      <P>There has been a decrease in respect for authority by young people, particularly when under the influence of alcohol and particularly in relation to the Garda. Six people have died as a result of violent incidents in Dublin in the last ten days, including two members of An Garda Síochána. We have also witnessed vicious attacks on the streets of Cork where in recent weeks two rapes have been committed and violent incidents are now a regular feature of weekend night life. As Deputy Shatter mentioned, two young men are still in a very serious condition in Cork University Hospital. One young man is on a life-support machine and the other, from Togher, has come off a life-support machine but is in need of critical care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, violent crime has replaced health as the key concern for citizens in the run-up to the general election. This Government has done little or nothing that is proactive in relation to street crime. Deputy Shatter also referred to Operation Oíche undertaken in October 2000 <Col N="95" /> and Operation Encounter in February 2002. Those two operations came about because the Minister felt obliged to introduce a political response following vicious incidents. However, nothing proactive has been done to tackle the real causes of crime.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Enforcement of Public Order) Bill is the most important proposed legislation in this area. It has been published but there has been no further progress. After five years, we do not even know if it will be passed before the end of this Government. For the past two years, Members on this side of the House have been trying to persuade the Minister to be proactive in this area, but almost nothing has happened. So much for zero tolerance. I read the Government's amendments to our motion with disbelief. The first amendment states:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann welcomes the substantial decrease in serious crime since the Government took office and the zero tolerance measures taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in achieving this remarkable result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">

      <P>Some result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The crime of physically attacking and almost killing or actually killing somebody, as we have seen in the past week, is most serious. The public wants this threat to individuals who are out enjoying themselves in towns and cities at night time to be addressed. Surely people are entitled to go out, enjoy themselves and get a taxi or bus home without feeling threatened by thugs on the streets. It is time we had a Government willing to take a truly tough line on crime as opposed to giving political responses to individual isolated incidents. We need a Government willing to take a tough approach to the causes of crime. Unless we deal with the real root causes, we are effectively just fire fighting as members of the Garda have to do at the moment.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about the causes of violent crime. Any garda who is dealing on a nightly basis with street violence in a city will say the biggest cause of fights, anti-social behaviour and trouble generally is an alcohol abuse, be it binge drinking or mixing alcohol with recreational drugs. In Cork, these are primarily ecstasy and cannabis, but in Dublin it is often heroin. We have done nothing to reduce alcohol consumption among young people and, if anything, we have made alcohol more freely available by extending licensing hours. There was a 300% increase in psychiatric treatment of teenagers with alcohol related problems between the years 1997 and 2000. If that rate of increase continues, the problem will shortly be impossible to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have completely failed to tackle under age drinking. On numerous occasions in this Chamber, I have asked the Minister to seriously consider the introduction of a mandatory ID card scheme or a national entitlement card scheme to <Col N="96" /> be politically correct. If we are serious about stopping 15 and 16 year olds binge drinking on a regular basis, surely a practical measure to try to reduce its incidence is to require a young person to show identification before being served. The Vintners' Federation, parents and even student bodies want a mandatory ID card scheme, but the Minister refused and offered a voluntary age card scheme. Only 40,000 people have applied and received such a card. That is less than the populations of UCD and UCC combined. The scheme has been a total failure. Are we seriously suggesting that 16 and 17 year olds will volunteer to get an ID card if they want to be served alcohol? Only young looking people aged over 18 will volunteer to get an entitlement card. So the scheme facilitates people to drink more.</P>
    <P>Where is the promised national alcohol awareness campaign or the national drugs awareness campaign that the Minister for State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, promised but has failed to deliver after five years? If I had more time, I would talk about the national drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to even approach the area of parental responsibility because it is afraid it is politically unpopular. When 15 or 16 year olds are caught causing havoc on the streets, their parents have responsibility and should be called to account. If necessary, in certain cases, parents should be fined for their children's offences.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about fighting street crime, we need a proper juvenile justice system. As an example of the type of juvenile justice system currently place, I quote from one of today's broadsheet newspapers:</P>
    <P>A teenage boy with 76 previous convictions was charged with taking nearly &euro;40,000 from a Securicor van in a violent robbery in the last few days. The 16-year-old boy is also facing another charge for biting a senior garda when it is alleged he attempted to escape custody. The boy had 76 convictions for robberies, car thefts and assaults when he was arrested in connection with the robbery. However, he has never served a sentence on any of those offences.</P>
    <P>What kind of a joke is our juvenile justice system? How frustrated must the judges and gardaí be in trying to implement the law?</P>
    <P>We also need a tough approach in stopping violent crime as well as tackling its causes. My colleague, Deputy Shatter, mentioned CCTV. We also need more gardaí on the beat. There has been a mere 8% increase in the numbers of gardaí in Cork city over the past five years and the numbers on the beat only increased very recently. Outside Dublin there has been no attempt to address public transport. The gardaí feel under threat due to inadequate equipment. Is it not time for the Minister to work with the Garda Commissioner to reassess the equipment available to the Garda? Is it sufficient for a garda to try to break up a fight with a small hand baton <Col N="97" /> when he is dealing with four or five people who are drunk or under the influence of drugs? It is time for a change of attitude towards crime and the only way to do that is with a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight's motion is very timely given that the issue of crime and personal safety is one of the main concerns of people of all ages. Last year I sent a questionnaire to 28,000 houses in my constituency and received a substantial number of replies. At the time, health was the dominant concern and crime and personal safety was close behind. People's concern about crime and personal safety is much deeper now than it was then.</P>
      <P>As the previous speaker said, in recent times the people of Cork have seen a number of innocent young people being beaten lifeless. In one case, where a man died before witnesses, no prosecution followed. I raised that issue in the Dáil just before Easter but have yet to receive a satisfactory reply. In the past two weeks in Cork city there has been an alleged rape case and a number of sexual assault incidents on young women. As a result, many women are now afraid to walk alone on the streets of Cork. The very serious case of alleged rape occurred within 100 yards of my home. In that area young and old alike are, to say the least, afraid. Not only are women afraid to venture out after dark, but some promising female athletes are afraid to undertake morning training sessions because of the situation in urban areas.</P>
      <P>In the Whitechurch and Carrignavar areas of my constituency &ndash; tranquil rural districts &ndash; people go about their daily lives respecting the law and their neighbours' rights. In recent times, however, such communities have witnessed a series of serious incidents, including the savage beating of an 80 year old woman, the robbery of a local shop, and attacks on domestic dwellings at all hours of the day. On a number of occasions last week I visited those areas and have never seen such anxiety and stress among the people living there. I have never heard so many expressions of fear from decent people who feel defenceless against the onslaught being made on their communities by criminals.</P>
      <P>In a week in which two gardaí lost their lives defending the community I will be very sensitive in speaking about the work of the Garda Síochána. Speaking to individual gardaí on a personal level I am always impressed by their commitment to the job and courage in the face of danger. However, many of them are frustrated by the manner in which their organisation is managed. There is an overdue need for a major review of the management of the Garda Síochána at the highest level to ensure maximum use is made of available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a bureaucratic stranglehold in the Garda Síochána. I have already referred to the numerous break-ins in the Whitechurch and Carrignavar areas of my constituency. Local residents <Col N="98" /> are mystified and angry that victims of crime who require the protection of the Garda Síochána are being told to contact gardaí in Cobh 20 miles away. Whitechurch is located about six miles north west of Cork city. There is a major Garda station about four miles away, in Blarney, but people living in the area are dependent on the protection of gardaí in Cobh because of bureaucratic boundaries. This rural hinterland on the periphery of Cork city has Garda stations at Carrignavar and Glanmire which are open during office hours five and a half or six days a week. Surely the Minister and Garda chiefs realise that the majority of criminals do not operate during office hours. There needs to be 24 hour protection of the community, seven days a week. Victims of crime are upset that bureaucratic mismanagement has left them defenceless for long periods during the week and cannot understand the reason they are dependent on a Garda station some 20 miles away. That is one example of mismanagement at the highest level.</P>
    <P>Last weekend a constituent informed me that having made a telephone call stating his house was under surveillance by criminals, the Garda did not arrive until six hours later. Having voted in the present Government, mainly because of the promises made by Fianna Fáil that there would be zero tolerance of crime, the public does not understand the reason these promises have been abandoned. People now lie dead on our streets, yet no one is prosecuted. The public does not understand the reason, when serious assaults take place against women, suspects are interviewed, files are sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the suspects are then released back into the community, some to reoffend. People cannot understand how, when break-ins take place on business premises and the thieves are caught on video, no prosecutions follow. Solutions to these issues could be implemented if the political will was there. Unfortunately, however, time has run out for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on current crime levels. I cannot help but recall the situation when the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was in opposition. He regularly hauled the then Minister, Deputy Owen, over the coals, blaming her for every single crime that occurred. I have no intention of doing this because I know the Minister wishes the fatal events of the past week could have been avoided. I have no intention of bringing the debate down to the personal level the Minister reached when in opposition.</P>
      <P>The situation is extremely serious and one cannot but sympathise with those who have been left as widows and orphans as a result of deaths caused by criminal activities. Above all, our thoughts are with the families of the two gardaí who died in a patrol car rammed by two youngsters in a stolen car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will no doubt provide statistics on all the extra gardaí he has deployed, but people <Col N="99" /> will judge the situation by how many gardaí they see patrolling the streets. As has already been mentioned, there is a real problem with groups of late night drinkers who gather around fish and chip shops. Parents lie awake at night not knowing when or how their offspring will return home. There is a real problem of alcohol and drug abuse. As Deputy Coveney said, drink presents possibly the worst problem of all. Some treatment is available for drug addiction, but the Government has totally ignored, and thus far failed to deal with, the serious problem of alcoholism.</P>
    <P>The Government earns &euro;2 billion in VAT and excise duty on alcohol, yet little if any of this money is spent on treating those who fall victim to alcoholism. Some months ago Ballybay town was in absolute uproar at 4 a.m. When some elderly ladies and others rang the Garda Síochána, they were told they would try to send a patrol, but it was already dealing with a similar row in Castleblayney. Fortunately for the people of Ballybay, by the time gardaí got there some time later &ndash; although the delay was no fault of the Garda Síochána &ndash; the crowds had dispersed. Before leaving, however, the crowds had caused extreme fear and anger among local residents.</P>
    <P>An aged couple living near the Border, along the M2 motorway, were glad to have so-called peace in the area, but their house was robbed in the middle of the day. They are now living in fear of a recurrence. The man's brother was a well known independent councillor who spent his life working for the community, yet his only remaining brother lives in fear, although there is supposed to be zero tolerance of crime. Does the Minister wish to be remembered for this issue?</P>
    <P>Joyriding is not just an issue in Dublin city. Last night I was travelling on a road in County Tipperary where people are living in fear of young people who seem to be out of control. A greater effort must be made to ensure identity cards are available and the ID system is enforced. It is not good enough simply to leave publicans liable for inaction on their part if the structures are not in place and fully understood.</P>
    <P>Crime figures are being manipulated and I make no apology for saying so. Many do not report crime because they do not believe it will be dealt with. Some judges act irresponsibly &ndash; again, I make no apology for saying so in the House &ndash; by letting people off with very light sentences. This leaves prosecuting gardaí totally frustrated. Young people are causing serious problems in broad daylight, never mind late at night. Much more support must be given to victims of crime rather than the perpetrators.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" />welcomes the substantial decrease in serious crime since the Government took office and the &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; measures taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in achieving this remarkable result;</P>
    <P>commends the enormous level of resources allocated to the Garda Síochána, including the increase of &euro;319.7 million, IR£252 million &ndash; 53% &ndash; in the Garda Síochána Vote, from &euro;599.3 million, IR£472 million, in 1997 to &euro;919 million, IR£723.7 million, in the current year;</P>
    <P>notes that the strength of the Garda Síochána now exceeds 11,700 &ndash; an all-time historic high &ndash; which constitutes an increase of approximately 900 members since the Government took office, and is on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 this year;</P>
    <P>recognises the provision of significant additional resources for other sectors of the criminal justice system, including increasing the number of prison places by 1,207 to date, with approximately 700 additional closed places on the way;</P>
    <P>commends the success of the Government in ending the scandal of the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; in our prisons system;</P>
    <P>commends the Minister's legislative record since taking office in enacting an unprecedented 46 Bills and, particularly, his reform of the criminal law;</P>
    <P>acknowledges the significant structural reforms being made to the criminal justice system through, for example, the appointment of additional judges, the establishment of the Courts Service and the Prisons Service and the significant progress being made in reforming the administration of the Garda Síochána;</P>
    <P>commends the allocation of additional resources aimed at the expansion of the probation and welfare service;</P>
    <P>endorses the measures adopted on the basis of the additional funding in the sum of &euro;110.5 million, IR£87 million, allocated under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for crime prevention directed towards young offenders;</P>
    <P>notes the social crime prevention activities supported by the Government as an important intervention in the lives of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young persons, not least the significant numerical expansion in Garda youth diversion projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present;</P>
    <P>welcomes the measures taken at community level to deal with local crime problems, including the massive expansion of the <Col N="101" /> Garda CCTV programme, for which &euro;15 million has been allocated over the period 2001-03; </P>
    <P>commends the Garda Síochána's national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, for its many successes in tackling public order issues since October 2000 and, in particular, its focus on &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; of criminal activity and high visibility patrolling;</P>
    <P>welcomes the commencement of the Garda Síochána's Operation Encounter on 23 February 2002, which builds upon Operation Oíche by using acquired information about the times and locations of previous public order incidents to address the problem at source, such as in the vicinity of night clubs, licensed premises and fast food outlets;</P>
    <P>endorses the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a further proactive response to tackling the problem of late night violence and disruption, in so far as it has its origins outside licensed premises or fast food outlets;</P>
    <P>notes that, according to the national household crime victimisation survey conducted by the Central Statistics Office in 1998, almost two thirds of assaults were reported to the Garda Síochána and that the principal reason cited for not reporting was that the incident was &ldquo;not serious enough/no loss&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>welcomes the measures taken by the Garda Síochána to facilitate the reporting of crime, particularly among members of ethnic minorities, through its quality customer service initiative and the establishment of a Garda racial and intercultural office;</P>
    <P>acknowledges the improvements in recent years in the service to victims of crime, including the publication of a victims charter and the provision of additional funding for service providers;</P>
    <P>notes the important steps taken in relation to dealing effectively with crime and crime related issues, including the fear of crime, through the establishment of the State's first ever national crime council;</P>
    <P>welcomes the high level of support among the community for the Garda Síochána; and</P>
    <P>approves the Government's continuing commitment to prioritise structural and legislative measures to build upon the significant advances made in the fight against crime and, in particular, to tackle effectively the problem of street violence.</P>
    <P>Today's debate takes place in the shadow of the tragic events of the past week or so. It is right that we should first convey our deepest sympathies to <Col N="102" /> those who have been bereaved in the course of those events. Two of those killed were members of An Garda Síochána &ndash; Garda Tighe and Garda Padden. They were killed early on Sunday morning when a stolen car, occupied by two teenagers, ploughed into their patrol car at the junction of The Rise and the Stillorgan Road in Stillorgan, County Dublin, when they were, in discharge of their duty in accordance with the best traditions of the force, attempting to protect the public in very dangerous circumstances. Garda Tighe's funeral took place this morning in Dublin. Garda Padden's takes place tomorrow morning in his native County Mayo. People who have attended the church services associated with these funerals &ndash; I know that Deputies on all sides of the House have done so &ndash; will have an acute awareness of the sadness and dignity associated with them. It would be the wish of most that this debate, which coincides with the funerals, should be characterised by the same sense of dignity, restraint and, above all, truth.</P>
    <P>If today, of all days, we allow truth and honest debate to fall victim to political gamesmanship, it will do absolutely nothing in terms of addressing the problem of crime, but simply convince the public which looks to us for reasoned debate and solutions to issues of public concern that honesty, a sense of reality and any real sense of concern about matters of public importance end at the door of the House. We should not, on this of all occasions, allow what would normally be taken simply as the cut and thrust of politics to obscure the true realities about crime and the responses to it or pretend that rhetoric can provide a substitute for actual solutions. Having said that, I must deal with the motion in the terms which Fine Gael have seen fit to put it before the House this evening.</P>
    <P>There are two striking things about the motion. First, it contains not even a vestige of an idea as to how crime should be tackled. It refers to the need to restore a sense of security on our streets. How is this to be achieved? What action is to be taken? The only answer in the motion is to condemn the Government. Second, the motion refers to an increase of 131% in public order offences during the year 2000. Where was this figure dreamed up? The number of public order offences rose in that year by about 18%, some of which would be attributable to increased Garda activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion refers to an astounding increase in the level of street violence, as distinct from public order offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of 18% is still worrying but very far short of 131%. It is up to the Members opposite to explain the reason, in their motion, they have seen fit to exaggerate the situation by a multiple of about six. It may be that they are confusing the figures for public order offences with the much smaller figure for headline assault offences, but such a mistake, presum<Col N="103" /> ing it is not a deliberate attempt to be misleading&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, on many occasions, outlined the actions taken over the past five years to address the problem of crime. It does a disservice to the truth to suggest, as some have done, that there has been no action. The public knows otherwise, because it has funded the very extensive measures the Government has put in place to tackle the serious crime situation existing when we took office. There is no merit &ndash; and no truth &ndash; in pretending that what has been done has not been done at all. The amendment to the motion summarises a list of actions which Members opposite seek to characterise as &ldquo;zero action&rdquo;. I do not propose to repeat them, but they expose the motion before the House this evening for the opportunistic sham that it is. I am the first to recognise and have repeatedly stated that while the level of serious crime has dropped significantly in recent years, there are absolutely no grounds for complacency. I have acknowledged &ndash; it would not only be dishonest but nonsensical to do otherwise &ndash; that certain forms of offending are a matter for genuine concern. Foremost among them is the problem of public order and street violence among youngsters, young males in particular.</P>
      <P>One of the first things to be said about this form of offending which is, incidentally, part of modern experience internationally is that it is not a problem that can be solved by law and order measures alone. All the expert advice, backed up by the common sense analysis of the vast majority of law abiding parents and citizens, points to the need for a multi-agency approach involving the education and health systems, housing issues, design of estates, issues of parental control among others. For this reason, the Government has ensured other approaches are taken, such as the introduction of preventive measures or the provision of increased custody alternatives for offenders in appropriate circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the probation and welfare service plays a vital role in the criminal justice system. At any one time, there are approximately 5,000 offenders serving community based sanctions under the supervision of the service which is involved in the management of offenders and the development of programmes for offenders in the community, often an alternative to custody. I have substantially increased the financial allo<Col N="104" /> cation for the service. In 1997 it was just over IR£12 million. This year it is over &euro;38 million, an increase of 116% since 1997. I have also secured an increase in the sanctioned staff by 46 to 268. The service supports a wide range of voluntary organisations working alongside it.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister, I have provided funding for 25 new or expanded community projects. There are now in the region of 65 such projects in the community. The range of services provided includes addiction treatment, counselling, education and work training and IT skills as well as providing offenders with general life skills. This expansion in community-based projects will continue under the &euro;38 million allocated to the service under the national development plan. Thanks to the National Development Plan 2000-2006, I have also overseen a huge increase in the number of Garda youth diversion projects from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present. There has been a corresponding increase in the total financial allocation of more than 1,000%. Obviously, such projects play a key preventative role in helping young people at risk from becoming involved, or becoming further involved in criminal activity.</P>
    <P>Having said that, a multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approach are absolutely vital. There is, however, no question whatsoever that specific measures in the area of law and order are important. I have no doubt that, despite the very significant investment in law and order options over the past five years and despite the extensive reforms of criminal law which I have brought on to the Statute Book, more remains to be done. I have already announced plans to further increase the strength of our Garda force by an additional 2,000 members, bringing it up to 14,000. I have already referred to my plans for further criminal law reform.</P>
    <P>As to the question of young offenders &ndash; I am referring generally to those under 16 years of age &ndash; there is clearly a perception, heightened by the tragic events of recent days, that they are completely above or outside the law. A particular source of concern is the fact that, all too often, people of 14 to 16 years of age, sometimes even younger, are involved in the lethal form of offending which is euphemistically called joy riding. Dealing with young offenders has always been seen as something which requires special skills and special approaches. I do not believe that anybody would seriously dispute the need for overall crime policy to take account of the special needs of people under the age of 16. Having said that, there comes a time when the rights and concerns of the law abiding majority have to be weighed against the rights of young offenders to be treated differently to others. In the past, we have had to take special measures when the problem of young offending became the source of acute public concern and I believe that, regrettably, the time has come to do the same again. Among the difficulties experienced at present, when the Children's Court wishes to remand a 14 or 15 year old &ndash; and I emphasise that I am talk<Col N="105" /> ing about accommodation for remands and not those convicted &ndash; they get in touch with Oberstown or Trinity House where they are sometimes advised that there is no accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a new problem. It has been a problem about which the Minister has done nothing for the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In that situation the youngster is either released or, exceptionally, committed to St. Patrick's Institution. In some cases, the young offender is sent to an adult prison. There are also certain other difficulties, all of which will be addressed when accommodation now being advanced by the Department of Education and Science is in place.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, it appears to be the case that judges and, indeed, gardaí are of the view that there is a shortage of remand accommodation, that this may influence the way in which young offenders are handled and almost certainly has a bearing on the way in which young offenders themselves view the risk of losing their liberty. It seems that many of them believe they can do what they like because nothing can be done about it. While it is not an ideal solution and one that I am adopting with reluctance, I have today obtained Government approval in principle for the re-designation of an existing prison or part of a prison so that the courts can be guaranteed that a small number of serious young offenders, whose presence in the community constitutes a serious threat to the rights and safety of law abiding citizens can, if necessary, be accommodated.</P>

      <P>Officials in my Department, the Prison Service and the Department of Education and Science will settle the details in the immediate future. The most likely option is that a section of St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin will be used for this purpose but I want to allow a period, and I am talking about days, for the details to be finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise that I do not see the measure I have just announced as a long-term solution to the problem of serious offending by persons under the age of 16. I see it as a short-term measure of last resort, pending the delivery of the new accommodation being advanced by the Department of Education and Science. Having said that, I do not believe that any right thinking person would expect the Government to allow a situation to continue where serious young offenders, and I am talking about a small number of very serious offenders, continue their criminal activities in the belief that there is nothing the courts or anybody else can do about them. If public safety requires that they be taken into secure custody, then that is what must happen. While in custody they will have all of the educational and other supports appropriate to people of their age. They will not be obliged to associate with older <Col N="106" /> offenders, but neither will they be allowed to continue visiting their criminal behaviour on law abiding citizens in the belief that they cannot be stopped. This is yet another practical measure we are taking in the fight against crime and I hope that the Members opposite who have belatedly and unconvincingly started to talk tough on crime will for once offer their support for an anti-crime measure.</P>
    <P>The sentence to be imposed on any criminal in respect of any crime is exclusively a matter for the Judiciary. That is the scheme ordained by our Constitution and that is the way matters must remain. However, it is legitimate for the Oireachtas to consider whether our legislative provisions adequately meet the needs of society. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993 empowers the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review a sentence which he regards as unduly lenient. This power applies only to sentences imposed on conviction on indictment. No such power currently exists in relation to sentences imposed on summary conviction. The power given by the 1993 Act has been used sparingly, but appropriately, by the Director of Public Prosecutions. This was the intention of the then Minister for Justice in 1993, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. When introducing the Bill, she said that a trial judge would have to have made a serious error, a serious breach of sentencing principles before he could review any sentence.</P>
    <P>There is no corresponding power of appeal in respect of sentences imposed on summary conviction. Indeed, given the limits on sentences which can be imposed in the District Court, it would be understandably more difficult for an appellant to establish the substantial departure from what would be regarded as the appropriate sentence necessary to justify an alteration of the sentence on appeal. Nevertheless, I consider that this is an area which merits examination and I intend to consider any submission which may be made in relation to whether the power given to the Director of Public Prosecutions under the 1993 Act should be extended in specific and limited circumstances to sentences imposed on summary convictions. I wish to make it clear that I do not envisage a general right of appeal being conferred, only the possibility that in cases where the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate should an appellate court be entitled to intervene.</P>
    <P>While this is not an occasion for political gamesmanship, I believe I must, because of the approach adopted in the motion and in the interests of truth, comment briefly on the record of the Opposition in relation to measures I have introduced in recent years.</P>

      <P>It must be conceded that the Opposition is entitled to be recognised for the consistency of its approach to the issue of crime and criminals over the past eight years. During the 30 month reign of the rainbow coalition, Ministers were repeatedly sent forward to proclaim their criminal justice mantra. Crime was at an &ldquo;acceptable level&rdquo;, &ldquo;no action was necessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;public concern about crime was the creation of Fianna Fáil and the media&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Opposition parties repeatedly voted against legislation which proposed ten year minimum sentences for substantial drug dealers. They permitted Garda numbers to dwindle and starved the Garda Síochána of much needed resources. However, they were consistent. To them, no legislation was necessary, crime was at an acceptable level and no additional measures were required. To the Opposition, the policy of ambivalent appeasement was acceptable. With such a record, how do they expect anybody to believe they are serious about tackling crime? In June 1997, Fianna Fáil went to the electorate with an alternative policy and said &ldquo;we will take resolute action against crime and criminals&rdquo; and, over the past five years, Fianna Fáil has kept faith with the electorate. The Government has enacted 34 statutes relating to criminal justice issues. As I said, it has provided 1,200 new prison places. It has ended temporary release as a method of prison space management and multiplied the resources made available to the Garda. By legislative reform and the provision of increased resources, it has brought about a situation whereby the incidence of serious crime has fallen in each successive year of its term of office.</P>
      <P>The level of serious crime has fallen by 27% in the past five years.</P>

Suffice to say I am convinced that many will have seen the Deputy's conduct to have been contemptible. If the electorate of Dublin South choose to banish him from the House, no injustice will have been done.</P>
      <P>Deputies Shatter and Howlin do not deserve the entire credit for the Opposition's consistency in soft options on crime policy. It is Deputy Ruairi Quinn who deserves the credit for cancelling the prison building programme, thus facilitating the continued presence on our streets of hundreds of sentenced prisoners. Deputies Howlin and Shatter did not object, not a bleat was heard from either of them. Deputy Quinn's act of short-sighted sabotage facilitated the already surging crime wave. Over the past eight years he has criticised every prison building measure introduced by the Government. If the House had implemented his criminal justice policy, how many sentenced prisoners would now walk the streets of our cities? After years of advocating the soft option on every criminal justice issue which came before the House he now hopes the electorate will forget his parliamentary history. He hopes it will forget everything he has said about crime over the past eight years, everything he has voted against over the last eight years, every cutback he made in the area of criminal justice during his tenure as Minister for Finance and buy into the pretence that he is going to be tough on crime. Anyone who needs to know the priority which he gives to the issue of crime and criminals need only look at the silly little card he carries around in his breast pocket. There, its size matching its substance, he sets out his top six priorities for the next Dáil. Search as one wishes, with the use of a magnifying glass or otherwise, one will find no mention on the card of the issue of crime or criminals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is at least consistent. When last in government he did nothing about crime and, if returned to government, his pledge is to do nothing about crime. Tonight he dispatches Deputy Howlin to the House to bleat that crime and criminal justice policy have been the major failings of the Government. So great an importance does the Labour Party attach to this issue that it does not even merit mention on its pledge card. The electorate will have a clear choice between the political parties which cancelled the prison building programme and those which built 1,200 additional prison places.</P>

On the Opposition benches, I called for more gardaí. In government I provided them. In opposition I called for more prison spaces. In government I provided them.

      <P>I am not so foolish as to assume it would be possible for me to eliminate crime in our society, but it is true &ndash; nobody can deny it &ndash; that back in 1996 and 1997 there was a very serious problem in relation to organised crime.</P>

However, in criticising me for my performance in opposition at least credit the public with some intelligence.

      <P>The Minister's contribution to this debate was typical. It underscores the reason people are so cynical about politics and politicians. Given what he said, is it any wonder that people have scant regard for anybody in the business of politics? The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>If today, of all days, we allow truth and honest debate to fall victim to political gamesmanship, it will do absolutely nothing in terms of addressing the problem of crime but simply convince the public, which looks to us for reasoned debate and solutions to issues of public concern, that honesty, a sense of reality and any real sense of concern about matters of public importance end at the door of the House.</P>
      <P>However, in the most shameful display of hypocrisy I have witnessed, the Minister embarked on a litany of political gamesmanship. It was an insult to those we have a responsibility to protect and are suffering this evening. It was a shameful contribution. In my time in the House I cannot recall a more debased speech. It began positively but quickly sank into political abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events of the past week, especially the cycle of violence at the weekend, which saw two members of the Garda Síochána killed by a driver in a stolen car in Stillorgan, another man murdered in Blanchardstown and dozens hospitalised as a result of street violence and disorder, put into stark relief the failure of the Government to deliver on its promise to the people &ndash; its only promise in this area &ndash; to ensure safer streets and safer communities. The Government has sunk to a new low and the Minister to a particularly embarrassing one when, in response to rightful criticism of his failures by Members on this side of the House, who have a lawful duty to hold him to account, he engaged in name calling members <Col N="112" /> of the Opposition. That is what he is reduced to after five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot have been taken by surprise at the horrific events at the weekend. Joyriding has been an ongoing problem in many urban areas for some time. Several people have been killed by stolen cars. In many respects it is a miracle that even more have not died. Two years ago the Labour Party introduced a Private Members' Bill to deal with this issue but the Government voted it down. The Minister need not lecture us on all his ideas, nor complain that no proposals are made on this side of the House. My colleague, Deputy Broughan, will deal with this aspect in more detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot be surprised that there is an enormous rise in violent crime. All the figures at his disposal point to that inescapable fact. No matter what gloss he puts on it, the official figures for the year 2000, published in January, showed an increase of more than 130% in the number of violent assaults. In a debate with me on &ldquo;Morning Ireland,&rdquo; the Minister admitted he had preliminary figures for 2001. I believe they will show an even more stark rise in the figures. I again challenge him to publish them this side of the electorate's decision on his competence. If he had made any effort to ascertain what was happening on the ground, he would not have been surprised to note that, as every Deputy will testify, the fear of crime was growing in every community.</P>
    <P>I commend the Fine Gael Party for tabling the motion. Last Saturday in my office in Wexford I had to face two parents in tears. Their young daughter, an athlete of note, was viciously assaulted on the streets of Wexford last Friday night to the extent that she was bitten. She had to attend hospital for tetanus and hepatitis shots. These realities are not occasional but constant happenings, particularly in the major urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister can talk through my contribution. I do not expect him to have regard for what I, Deputy Shatter or any other Member on this side of the House have to say, but I want him to understand the reality. It is not the fanciful world in which he lives. The comment piece in today's edition of <i>The Mirror</i> sets out the views of a journalist reflecting the feelings of members of the public. It states:</P>
    <P>John O'Donoghue is living in cloud cuckoo land. The Minister for Justice must be the only person left who believes that Ireland's cities are safe places in which to live. He repeats the mantra, <i>ad nauseum,</i> that crime has fallen since he came to office. That is just not the case. The people do not believe you. The gardaí do not believe you. In fact, no-one believes your propaganda anymore.</P>
    <P>The Minister can spin all he likes, read the statistics, massage the figures and present the money, but the same newspaper headlines 19 murders, 638 assaults, 23,600 thefts, 370 arsons in just one year in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" />That is the vision of the real Ireland, reflected in a newspaper. It is not invented by the Opposition to be dismissed by the Minister. It is manifest in a variety of ways. For example, people have contacted me about home insurance, the cost of which has sky-rocketed. I telephoned Hibernian Insurance Company today to ascertain the reason and was told it was because of the huge increase in the number of burglary claims. These are the realities, not invented by the Opposition, that must be addressed. They would be addressed in a civilised way by a Minister who was not so consumed with his own self that he could engage with the Opposition to see how constructively a Parliament and a justice committee could work to bring forward good ideas we could embrace. It would mean that when Deputy Broughan proposes a joyriding Bill or when I propose a Garda authority or ombudsman, they would get serious consideration by a Minister who was serious about his job, rather than a dismissal that if they do not come from the man from Cahirciveen, they are not worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister has refused to heed the abundant signs that crime is now drifting out of control. The more he sits with his head in the sand the worse it will get. The only good thing is that he will not be in charge of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for much longer. We are paying the price for that attitude of ignorance. Until there is a Minister for Justice who acknowledges the scale and seriousness of the problem and is prepared to take action, more people will be put at risk on the streets and more people will die, be wounded or live in fear.</P>
    <P>The Government has fewer excuses than any previous Administration for the serious deterioration in the crime situation. It has had the luxury of being able to serve its full five year term. Most previous Ministers had a more truncated term of office in which to implement a policy platform. The Minister had every advantage of serving a full five year term.</P>
    <P>Every Government over the past 30 years had to devote huge resources, time and effort to dealing with the security situation pertaining to Northern Ireland. Apart from the time it demanded of the Minister, huge amounts of finance, resources and Garda personnel had to be devoted to combating terrorism. Another luxury the Minister enjoyed was the great potential offered by time, resources and Garda manpower which were no longer devoted to combating terrorism.</P>
    <P>The Government has also been in office at a time of unprecedented economic growth, when the State's coffers were overflowing. Previous Ministers, who operated in less favourable economic climates, had to fight for every pound and every extra garda at Cabinet. The debate was whether we could recruit extra nurses, gardaí, teachers or manpower in the security area. This time there was great potential because the money was there to have all of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no excuse. He had no problems arising from time, resources or scope, but <Col N="114" /> despite such wonderful opportunities, he has been an utter failure. The potential that was available makes his failure all the more inexplicable. There was record economic growth and an increase in the number of people at work. There were fewer people, therefore, available to commit crime. Employment was available for more and more people and fewer people were without jobs. These factors combined to create the most auspicious set of circumstances enjoyed by any Minister for Justice. They were the best economic and social circumstances to eradicate crime. The Minister failed to take advantage of them and presided over a frightening increase in the level of street violence and disorder.</P>
    <P>There will be many debates about this issue in the coming weeks. I hope they will not be conducted on the basis of vulgar abuse but engage in the issues. Members of the House are transient; we are only passing through and there should be some legacy of trying to cope with the problems that impact on people's lives.</P>
    <P>By the Minister's own measure shall he be judged. He set his own standard when he spoke in the Dáil in November 1997. He said the final test of whether the strategy was or was not implemented would be whether the people, following the completion of the Government's term of office, felt safer. He set the test. The latest opinion poll shows that 71% of the people feel less safe now than when the Minister took office. By his own measure, his term of office has been a failure.</P>

      <P>I think it was General de Gaulle who said all political careers end in failure. Most would agree that this was never more true and fitting than in relation to the outgoing Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is even sadder when one considers the hopes raised in the 27th Dáil when the Opposition spokesman, Deputy O'Donoghue, brought forward approximately 13 Bills, a couple of which were generously accepted by the rainbow Government. That was a platform we thought to build on but five years later I must say, more in sorrow than in anger, that the Minister's administration in the last five years has been a dismal failure.</P>
      <P>I have referred previously to the problem of crime statistics. It is a significant one. The Garda Síochána report for the year 2000 does not, unfortunately, describe the reality of that year. I urge the Minister, in these final days of his administration, to give the Central Statistics Office responsibility for collating and producing crime statistics. The <i>Irish Independent</i> showed about 18 months ago that less than half the crimes committed and of which people are victims are reported to the Garda Síochána or the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling and tragic deaths last weekend of Garda Michael Padden and Garda Tony Tighe once again brought before the public the serious crime of car theft and joyriding. I sympathise with the families and relatives of Garda Padden and Garda Tighe and their home communities in <Col N="115" /> Belmullet and south Dublin. The Labour Party endured similar pain during the years when a number of people who were dear to us and active in the community movement, like Ritchie Green and his daughter, were slaughtered by similar criminals.</P>
    <P>The situation which was highlighted again last weekend has been seen many times in areas of north and west Dublin, Cork and Limerick. It is an ongoing phenomenon. The latest phase began six or eight weeks ago. Even though we could show that approximately ten stolen cars each night were being used to torment citizens on the north side of Dublin and turn their lives into a living hell, no serious action was taken by the Minister. I commend the attempts over the last two and a half years of the Priorswood anti-joyriding task force, the Darndale tenants and residents association, the Belcamp estate steering committee and the other bodies which have tried, with the Garda Síochána in the J and surrounding districts, to control this horrible crime.</P>
    <P>I have carried out a rough count of the number of times I have brought the phenomenon of joyriding to the attention of the Dáil. I believe this is the 30th time I have done so in my five years' membership of the 28th Dáil. I have with me a detailed letter I wrote on Thursday, 3 February 2000, in which I strongly urged the Minister to bring forward legislation and implement a programme of measures to control this menace. However, he would not listen. In his unfortunate arrogant way he refused to take any action, citing the 1961 and other legislation. For that reason I introduced, this morning, the Road Traffic Bill, 2002, an anti-joyriding measure. It would create two new crimes. One is the crime of joyriding, which would be designated a serious crime carrying serious penalities. The other is the crime of assisting or enabling children to get possession of cars by gift, hire or sale &ndash; the so-called phenomenon of company cars. The Minister has little time left, perhaps a day or two. I ask him again if, in the same generous spirit which the rainbow Government showed to him, he would give us a little of the remaining Government time to introduce this Bill. He and his colleagues will suffer drastically at the hands of our voters in a number of weeks' time because of his lackadaisical and careless approach to this matter.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Law Reform).</P>
    <P>Mr. Shatter: Are there copies of the Minister's speech? He started at two or three minutes to seven and at that point it had not been distributed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Copies are being distributed. As I was saying, I thank Members for agreeing to deal with this matter at relatively short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset I have expressed the view that the tragic death of Mr. Carthy required detailed, open and transparent examination in a manner which addressed issues of public concern. Once the Director of Public Prosecutions decided that charges should not be preferred in the matter, I <Col N="117" /> obtained the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas to refer the report of the Garda Commissioner into the fatal shooting to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for its consideration. This was done and the joint committee submitted the report to both Houses in the form of an interim report, enabling it to be published, and established a sub-committee to consider it.</P>
    <P>Even in the immediate aftermath of this sad event I did not rule out a public inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Acts. I was of the view that a decision on such an inquiry, before hearing the views of the sub-committee on the report of the Garda Commissioner, would be premature. Members will also recall that after the initial High Court ruling in this matter last November I indicated my willingness to recommend to the Houses of the Oireachtas that the tragic death of Mr. Carthy be made the subject of a public inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Acts in the event that further inquiries by the Oireachtas could not proceed on legal grounds. The option of proceeding with the Oireachtas sub-committee's inquiry into this matter cannot now be pursued in light of the recent ruling of the Supreme Court and in accordance with my previous statements in the matter I have obtained Government approval for moving this resolution.</P>
    <P>Last week's Supreme Court ruling obviously has wider implications than those applying to the sub-committee's inquiry which need to be examined. The House will appreciate that the judgments were lengthy, detailed and complex and reaching conclusions in relation to what action might need to be taken will inevitably take time.</P>
    <P>What is before the House today is a motion seeking an inquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of John Carthy at Abbeylara, County Longford on 20 April 2000. It should not be taken as a view of any wrongdoing by any member of the Garda Síochána. Indeed, along with other Members of this House, I have in the past expressed appreciation for the exceptional service to the State of the Garda Síochána. In light of the unfortunate events of last Sunday when two gardaí, Garda Anthony Tighe and Garda Michael Padden, lost their lives in the service of the State, it is timely to remember not only their unstinting service but also the continuing service afforded the citizenry of this State by their colleagues in the force.</P>
    <P>However, the fatal shooting of Mr. Carthy clearly raises serious questions which must be answered and serious issues which must be addressed. The use of firearms by members of the Garda Síochána is, in itself, a relatively exceptional occurrence in what remains in general an unarmed force. This tradition of unarmed policing has been one of the great strengths of the Garda Síochána: there are, however, occasions where the gardaí must have the capacity to use firearms and the circumstances where this can occur are strictly regulated by the Garda auth<Col N="118" /> orities. The use of firearms is an option of last resort and any incident involving their use is regarded by the Garda authorities as a serious matter. When, as in this case, the use of firearms results in a death, it is a matter of utmost priority to determine the facts leading to and surrounding the death in order to know what happened, why it happened and what lessons might be learned for the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed terms of reference, they are sufficiently specific and comprehensive to allow for a full and complete inquiry into the tragic events at Abbeylara in April 2000. In this regard, it should be noted that the proposed tribunal is being empowered to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to the matters falling within its remit.</P>
    <P>Section (I) provides that the tribunal shall report to the Clerk of the Dáil on an interim basis not later than four months from the date of establishment of the tribunal and also as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the tribunal on the following matters: (a) the number of parties granted representation by the tribunal, (b) the progress which will then have been made in the hearings and work of the tribunal, (c) the likely duration &ndash; so far that may then be capable of being estimated &ndash; of the proceedings of the tribunal, and (d) any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report, including any matters relating to its terms of reference. This is a standard provision and need not detain us.</P>
    <P>Section (II) provides that the inquiry shall be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest possible date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it. Section (III) provides that all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the tribunal should, as far as it is consistent with the interests of justice and the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002, be borne by those individuals. I am not yet in a position to announce who will conduct the inquiry but I hope to make the necessary arrangements as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The circumstances surrounding the events in Abbeylara in April 2000, which have given rise to this resolution, are matters of public concern. We need to establish what happened there and what lessons may be learned for the future. I believe that the tribunal, as provided for in this resolution, will be able to effectively discharge this obligation. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this motion is before the House and I agree with the background explanation for the motion which the Minister gives. The circumstances surrounding the events in Abbeylara in April 2000, which have given rise to the motion, are indeed matters of public concern and there is a need to establish what happened there and what lessons may be <Col N="119" /> learned for the future. It is clear in the context of the decision of the High Court and the Supreme Court that it is no longer possible for a committee of this House to conduct the inquiry and the appropriate mechanism is the tribunal of inquiry that the Minister is now appointing.</P>
      <P>This is the second tribunal which this Minister is having to appoint to inquire into matters relating to An Garda Síochána. I do not believe it is in the public interest that when issues arise that are of genuine public concern we should keep on having to put in place a new tribunal on each occasion. This Minister should by now have realised the need to put in place new permanent structures to address issues in a comprehensive, fair and considered manner which ensures that where there are public concerns they can be speedily addressed and where issues arise relating to individual members of the Garda, they are, in the interests of the Garda Síochána, addressed in order that members of the force do not find themselves unfairly working under a cloud, particularly in circumstances where false allegations have been made. The lesson of recent years is that we must have a Garda ombudsman and an inspectorate and I regret the fact that the Minister still has not realised there is a need for a permanent structure to be put in place through which comprehensive inquiries can be conducted in relation to matters of public concern regarding members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on one point. No one in this House has made any decision of any nature whatsoever in relation to the Abbeylara incident, as it has been called. The death of John Carthy was a tragedy. There is no doubt that particular difficulties arose for members of the Garda Síochána in dealing with the events that took place in Abbeylara and it is regrettable, in the context of the inquiry that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights commenced, that a perception grew on behalf of members of An Garda Síochána that any member of the committee had made any prejudgment or drawn any conclusions.</P>
      <P>As a member of that committee, I can say quite categorically that each member of that committee approached the task that they understood they were to undertake with an entirely open mind. They also approached it clearly aware of the fact that the late John Carthy had very serious psychiatric difficulties and that the gardaí were confronted with very substantial difficulties on the fateful days in Abbeylara when they had to deal with the incident that occurred. There was no question of anyone not recognising the nature of the difficulties, but each of the members of the committee, on foot of the Minister referring the issue to the committee, was of the view that we had a duty to address in the public interest the concerns that had arisen. Those concerns will now be addressed, comprehensively I hope, by the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" />In welcoming this resolution, I hope the tribunal when it commences its work will be able to undertake that work not only in a manner in which there is no doubt about the fairness of the approach taken, but also in a manner that ensures conclusions are reached within a reasonable period of time. I also hope it can conduct its work in such a way as to make recommendations to ensure that any lessons from what occurred in Abbeylara are learned and that any necessary action is taken on foot of those recommendations.</P>
    <P>I particularly resent as quite outrageous a comment made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the speech he delivered a short time ago in reply to the Private Members' motion. I am well used to political charges, as is the Minister, that go across the floor during Private Members' time when debating issues of genuine public concern and on which people have strong views. I have also no difficulty in coping with any particular charges that the Minister may make, but there was one comment in his speech which was singularly inappropriate in the context of what we are now dealing with. In attacking the critique I and Deputy Howlin gave of his failure to deal with street violence, the Minister, in respect of the gardaí, alleged that neither of us was slow to &ldquo;trumpet alleged shortcomings&rdquo; within the Garda Síochána and that we abandoned what he alleges to be our so-called &ldquo;go soft&rdquo; policy on crime. I reject entirely the suggestion that we have a &ldquo;go soft&rdquo; policy. I treat that with the same contempt as I treated his sloganeering about zero tolerance. There were serious issues of public concern in respect of the Abbeylara incident. They were raised by Deputy Howlin and me in a legitimate form, which resulted in those issues being forwarded to an Oireachtas committee. Now the Minister agrees they should be dealt with by a tribunal. That has nothing to do with the trumpeting of alleged shortcomings of the Garda Síochána. It is about this House responding to issues of public concern, which the Minister acknowledges must be addressed. The only other issue the Minister would have in mind in this context is the other tribunal, which he has now recognised as necessary and which has been appointed to look at issues relating to the gardaí in Donegal. If Members of this House failed to respond to genuine issues of public concern relating to An Garda Síochána, we would be doing a disservice to the people, betraying our mandate as elected Members of this Parliament and doing a disservice to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In the context of the two aforementioned issues, the Minister, in reference to Donegal, had to acknowledge belatedly the need for a tribunal. In this respect he is now at one with the Opposition parties in bringing forward a motion to provide for a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I do not mind what charges the Minister wants to lay in the heat of electioneering and campaigning. In terms of the two issues in respect of which tribunals have now been appointed, it goes <Col N="121" /> beyond the boundaries of acceptable political attack to suggest that, because either I or Deputy Howlin acted in the public interest resulting in two tribunals of inquiry being appointed with the full support of the Minister, we were trumpeting shortcomings within the Garda Síochána. No doubt the charges were devised by Fianna Fáil public relations advisors and political strategists more with the forthcoming election campaign in mind than dealing with issues with any semblance of the truth.</P>

      <P>After the next election, should I have the honour still to be a Member of this House and should the Minister and Deputy Howlin be in this House, it will be of great importance that the House gives detailed consideration to the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court, which has profound implications for the future workings of this House with regard to the committee system and inquiring into issues of public concern. That is an issue to which we will have to return on another day. For initial consideration it should be referred to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. I hope that committee will be reconstituted after the next election and that, immediately thereafter, the implications for the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas of the judgments will be considered by it and that it will make any recommendations it sees appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The justice spokespersons are busy today. I welcome this motion. It is a very difficult issue. I regret that it has hung as an unresolved issue for so long because I can only imagine the pain, trauma and difficulties it has presented to the family of the late John Carthy and the members of the Garda Síochána who were involved in the operation. Also, for all those related to them it has been a traumatic and difficult time. The sooner the issues are addressed, the facts discovered and whatever lessons that need to be learned are learned the better. Therefore, I hope the tribunal of inquiry will be a speedy affair.</P>
      <P>I said the issue is very difficult for all concerned. I hope the Minister will find a suitable member or members for the tribunal expeditiously. Will he indicate if he intends to have consultation with the Opposition parties in relation to the person who will be invited to be the sole member, if there is to be a sole member, or in respect of how the tribunal is to be constituted? I would welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the location of the tribunal? It does not necessarily have to be in the city of Dublin. It might be more convenient to all concerned and have an implication for the scale of the tribunal to have it elsewhere, and the Minister might examine that possibility. Unlike many of the tribunals we have had the net issues of this <Col N="122" /> one are not as complex because it concerns a series of events that need to be examined. The duration of this tribunal need not be overly long. I hope we will be able to convey that view of the House to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I reiterate strongly the views and comments of Deputy Shatter in respect of the sub-committee. The sub-committee sought to do a job in a very proper way. All the members of the committee, which was chaired by a distinguished member of the Minister's party, came to it with an open mind, sought to probe issues that were of public concern and learn what lessons we could put into practice either by way of legislation or otherwise, a very important point.</P>
    <P>Since I have published legislation in this regard myself, I am strongly of the view that dealing with ongoing difficulties, public concerns or controversial matters that relate to the Garda Síochána by way of tribunals is not something we can continue. I hope the Ombudsman proposal I brought forward nearly two years ago will be accepted by the Minister or that he will bring forward his own version, the Garda inspectorate, which I understand is still promised, and that it will be enacted expeditiously so that we will have a standing committee to deal with matters like this expeditiously because they are traumatic for the families and members of the Garda Síochána concerned. Controversy surrounds an issue which is difficult for them and it might be appropriate if there was no such controversy.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by making a general comment on the Supreme Court decision which has implications not only for the Abbeylara sub-committee but for the workings of the House. Those of us who have been directly involved have had an opportunity to reflect on it but my view, unlike that of Deputy Shatter, is that it should not be referred to the committee on the Constitution because it has fundamental implications for the workings of the House in that we will have to determine the type of committee system we want. We made a series of decisions at the beginning of the last Dáil and the Government has proposed a parliamentary commission. That is a good basis on which to expand away from the financial and structural matters the parliamentary commission Bill envisages and examine the way in which the Dáil will operate in the 21st century, mindful of the checks and balances that are required in terms of the rights of individuals.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is in the Chamber and I presume he intends to contribute to the debate &ndash; I am aware of his views on this matter. I am struck by a pattern developing in modern Ireland where more people are gathering, vindicating, pronouncing and defending rights with fewer responsibilities, and it is becoming more difficult to examine action. It appears that the only people remaining who are open to full scrutiny are Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but as a society we have fundamental questions to address on that matter and I hope they will be <Col N="123" /> addressed by a parliamentary commission in due course.</P>
    <P>I hope this tribunal of inquiry will be in operation very quickly, that it will conduct its business expeditiously and comprehensively and that those who are directly involved in this matter can finally bring closure to the difficult issues that continue to concern them and need to be addressed.</P>

That has been my position over the years and it is the position that binds all of us. Second, I want to express our personal concern for the Carthy family in terms of this incident.

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. When this committee initially sought powers to conduct an inquiry of this nature, I received a request, as chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, to allow some of my staff to be seconded to the committee to enable it&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The request was made by the chairman, Deputy Ardagh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to conduct the inquiry of the type it thought it was sufficiently competent and authorised to conduct. I wrote immediately to the Head of Administration stating that I would normally feel obliged to co-operate with every chairman of every committee in the discharge of his or her functions in this House but that in this instance I could not agree to seconding any of my staff to this committee because it was operating <i>ultra vires</i> and setting itself up as judge and jury on an issue on which it was neither competent nor qualified to do under the Constitution. I put that on the record at the time and when the High Court gave its decision, seven of the eight points in its conclusion related specifically to the manner in which the Abbeylara sub-committee, on which Deputy Shatter was very active in acting as a cross-examiner and ballistics expert, conducted its business.</P>
      <P>The High Court decision clearly stated in regard to all those points that the committee was functioning outside its powers and that the manner in which it was conducting the inquiry was inappropriate and unconstitutional. The eighth point referred to whether all committees of the Oireachtas could make findings which might impugn the good name and character of someone outside this House, something which could have serious implications for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter will remember the day the committee decided, without consulting any of us, to appeal the High Court decision to the Supreme Court, which cost more money, created more doubt, caused additional anxiety to the family and cast a shadow over the Garda Síochána. I went before the committee, which I am entitled to do as a Member of this House, and told its members that they were, to say the least, ill-advised, unqualified to do the job, acting outside the Constitution and wasting further taxpayers' money. Deputy Shatter attacked me in the committee for saying that but I told the members <Col N="125" /> there was no possibility of them overruling the High Court decision in these matters.</P>
    <P>At that time I also wrote to the Ceann Comhairle because I was concerned that this committee, particularly Deputies Shatter and Howlin, were losing the run of themselves&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle and asked him, in the interest of all the committees of the House, if he would protect us from the self-righteous, omniscient attitude of people such as Deputy Shatter, although I did not use those terms in my letter. He and I have engaged in public debate on this issue which he remembers well. Unfortunately, I have been proved right. We have a Supreme Court judgment which could never have been any other way. There is no basis for the appeal suggested by the committee. We have wasted time and money and caused further anxiety and doubt to the family at the centre of the affair. There is a shadow over the Garda Síochána which should never have been there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the motion which will enable us to do properly what we should have been doing for so long: to establish a tribunal, which we are authorised, as legislators, to do, to inquire into these matters. Deputy Shatter made some statements about how there would be grave consequences for the House and said that after the general election we would need to reinvestigate the matter. The implication was that I would not be here at that stage. I will, however, be watching with great interest if we hold a constitutional referendum to correct the Supreme Court decision. What a self-righteous, pompous attitude to have. The Supreme Court <Col N="126" /> and all the other courts have their own powers and we have ours. It came to a decision about whether a supposedly omniscient, self-righteous sub-committee in which Deputy Shatter, as he knows, played the lead role, should continue. I see no reason the people should have to vote in a constitutional referendum to give Deputy Shatter the power of being witness, ballistics expert, cross-examining counsel and judge, as he wishes.</P>
    <P>I have only had the opportunity of reading the Supreme Court decision very briefly as I have been away. However, it does not surprise me any more than did the original High Court decision. It does not go as far as Deputies Shatter and Howlin would have us believe. It does not state &ndash; this does not surprise me &ndash; that the Oireachtas and its committees cannot conduct inquiries of the kind we need from time to time to ensure there is no wrongdoing in the organisations for which we are responsible. The parliamentary legal adviser, confirming my own views, has said clearly the Supreme Court decision dismissed the appeal taken by the State and the committee against the High Court decision but that it narrowed the principal declaration of the High Court to the circumstances of the case in order that a wide range of parliamentary inquiries is still within the scope of the Oireachtas. The principal order is limited to the Abbeylara inquiry &ndash; surprise, surprise. It is limited to the inquiry in which Deputies Shatter and Howlin set themselves up as ballistics experts and cross-examining counsel.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision states &ndash; Deputy Shatter thinks this is wrong also &ndash; that there was no inherent parliamentary power to conduct the inquiry. How right it was. That was obvious to anyone except those who did not want to see it, those whose egos were so inflated that they had decided to act as judges at a tribunal of inquiry and bring about a conclusion which was not necessarily favourable towards the Garda Síochána and might be unduly distorted in respect of the family. The Ceann Comhairle will be aware of my concerns as I wrote to him at the time, but I regret to say that the consequences of the sub-committee's and Deputy Shatter's egomania in going far beyond their powers have led to a prolonged shadow over the Garda Síochána, much anxiety for the family and, to the extent that this is any concern of Deputy Shatter's, very considerable cost. For this reason I vigorously support the Minister's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of this tribunal, but I am extremely disappointed at Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution. When the Garda report was given to the Minister he passed it on to the committee. It is quite obvious that at that time the Minister had the option of doing what he is finally doing now and establishing a tribunal. I am surprised that a man of Deputy O'Kennedy's experience did not make that very obvious point. I come from the county where this tragedy occurred. Initially there was huge con<Col N="127" /> cern among the people of Abbeylara and the surrounding area, rightly so. In the past, whenever there was a fatal shooting and the Garda was involved it had always been something to do with a terrorist group or an armed robbery. Understanding that the Garda would have to have its own inquiry &ndash; as has always been the case whenever there has been a fatality &ndash; I asked that the findings of the Garda inquiry be made public and after some deliberation the Garda authorities agreed. That, to some extent, was a welcome development.</P>
      <P>The Garda inquiry was detailed and carried out over a long period. After receiving a copy of the results of the inquiry the family was still not satisfied. The Minister then had the option of taking the action he has taken today. Much has been said here about reducing the burden of anxiety for the family and so on. The Government had an opportunity then of doing so. I welcome the inquiry and hope the Minister will appoint a chairman as soon as possible. I hope the inquiry will establish the facts of what happened that day and give an insight to the Garda and society in general into how to deal with a person who has a firearm and is a danger to himself and the public. The Garda was initially called under circumstances such as these. Without anticipating the result of the tribunal, I welcome the fact that Government has now realised that this was the way to go after the Garda report came out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Belton for sharing his time. I also welcome the motion for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry into the fatal shooting of John Carthy by members of the Garda Síochána at Abbeylara, County Longford, on 20 April 2000. Mr. Carthy was a man of 27 years, a labourer living in a small country house with his widowed mother. He had no criminal record. He was suffering from the kind of turmoil which can only be understood by those who have experienced mental illness. He had previously received residential psychiatric treatment. John Carthy was at times a troubled young man, but a young man who had the support of his family and, quite obviously, that of his community. They testified after his death and have maintained that he was not a man who posed a danger to anyone except perhaps himself.</P>
      <P>On the fatal day, John Carthy barricaded himself in his own home. He had a shotgun in his possession, but there was no hostage. There began a sequence of events and, crucially, a sequence of decisions at senior Garda level which led ultimately to the tragic death of John Carthy. Even before John's death, and while the siege at Abbeylara was ongoing, major questions were being raised about the nature of the Garda operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the response to what was essentially a limited and containable incident was extremely excessive. A minor civil disturbance involving a young man whose mind was troubled <Col N="128" /> and who needed, above all, reassurance and assistance, was turned into a full-blown armed siege. We must question and challenge the decision at senior Garda level to send in armed special branch gardaí and, even more questionably, the elite, secretive and highly armed emergency response unit. Ranged around the little house in which John Carthy was alone with a shotgun were dozens of gardaí armed with Uzi submachine guns, Heckler and Koch submachine guns, pump-action shotguns and pistols. The members of the ERU wore heavy combat equipment and were arrayed around the house with all the paraphernalia necessary for a small-scale military engagement.</P>
    <P>The decision to send in these forces was fatal. It meant that John Carthy was, in effect, treated as an armed enemy rather than a man who clearly needed help. It is obvious that such aid was denied and that those who could have helped were, very worryingly, denied access to him. The result was the fatal shooting of this young man. Even with the overbearing presence of armed gardaí, this was by no means an inevitable outcome. The key question the tribunal must answer is how and why gardaí fatally shot John Carthy outside his own home and if they could have avoided this death.</P>
    <P>The inquiry is long overdue. I support the call of the Carthy family, which I hope it is taken up by the Minister, that the proceedings be held in County Longford. The tribunal must also consider larger but very much related questions. The Abbeylara affair, like the Donegal Garda scandal, shows the need for fundamental reform of the Garda Síochána. Successive Governments have failed to address the totally unacceptable situation where gardaí investigate wrongdoing by other members of the force. There is a need for a Garda ombudsman with extensive powers to act on behalf of citizens and to safeguard their rights.</P>
    <P>For decades in this State, the elite in politics and the church enjoyed power without accountability. Recent years have seen a light shone on those institutions as never before. Many who enjoyed positions of power and privilege have been held accountable at last, and that is to the good of both and of society as a whole. The Garda has been a highly centralised force in which elite groups have wielded excessive power. This has served neither the real interests of gardaí themselves nor those of the communities they serve. This type of practice must be brought to an end and I hope that the process of establishing this tribunal is proof that real change is beginning to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Contributors asked whether there is a need for a new mechanism in order to deal with the situation where inquiries are needed in respect of the Garda Síochána. I have stated that a new Garda inspectorate will be established which will have the capacity to examine every aspect of Garda operations policy from the point of view of best policing practice. For the purpose of carrying out its various functions, the inspectorate will operate completely independently and its staff will be appointed by and be responsible to the inspectorate. The overall purpose is to introduce new, independent and transparent procedures which reflect modern conditions in order to maintain and enhance public support for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The powers of the inspectorate will be extensive. It will be open to the inspectorate to undertake an inspection on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Garda Commissioner. To ensure transparency, the results of reviews carried out by the inspectorate will be published unless this would not be appropriate for security or other important reasons. One of the requirements for securing public confidence in a police force is to ensure that where a member of the public believes he or she has a legitimate ground for complaining about the behaviour of a police officer, there is available a procedure which will enable his or her complaint to be properly and fully investigated in as open and transparent a way as possible. This applies fully to the Garda Síochána which also has a vital interest in having this type of procedure available.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant aspects of the new arrangements for handling complaints will be that the inspectorate will undertake that function completely independently of any other body, including the Garda Síochána. In particular, the inspectorate will conduct investigations into complaints itself and for that purpose will use its own personnel, resources and powers. Measures will also be put in place to address the issue of vexatious complaints, which can undermine a complaints system and delay the processing of legitimate cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reply to Deputy Shatter's assertion that I was not correct in stating that he had been critical of the Garda Síochána. In a press statement dated Thursday, 31 August 2000, the Deputy stated &ldquo;There must be a radical change in policing methods. Too frequently gardaí are nowhere to be found and some, when informed of incidents, have a limited interest in responding to requests for intervention.&rdquo; If that is not a criticism of the Garda Síochána, will somebody tell me what is? Deputy Shatter was as wrong in criticising my statement in this regard earlier this evening as he was wrong about the Patrick <Col N="130" /> Naughton case. However, I do not anticipate that&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have arranged for copies to be distributed.</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Rarely has a Bill come before this House which has its origins in circumstances which have resulted in so much grief, suffering and the loss of so many loved ones. The premature loss of fathers, husbands, brothers and sons within the haemophilia community is a tragedy of immense proportions. That it should happen to a relatively small group of our citizens is all the more poignant. The haemophilia community in this country has suffered to a truly extraordinary degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's proposals outlined in this Bill are about compensation and how the State addresses or, to be more accurate, re-addresses this historic and tragic episode which has had <Col N="131" /> deep and bitter consequences for so many people. The proposals will, I am confident, bring closure to the efforts of the State to compensate persons with haemophilia and their families arising out of the consequences of the HIV virus with its associated heavy burden of sickness, suffering and premature death.</P>
    <P>As we know, however, financial compensation cannot undo the harm that has been done to so many, or make up for the loss of life, health or well being. Financial compensation is nevertheless one measure which can assist those haemophiliacs who have the virus and the families who are living with its consequences and so ease the burden of the loss they have suffered and continue to suffer.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, I am especially pleased to be in a position to bring to the House these proposals to extend the entitlements of HIV infected haemophiliacs and their dependants. The proposals will also benefit the dependants of persons with hepatitis C who have died as a result of receiving blood or a blood product or where hepatitis C was a significant contributory factor to the cause of death.</P>
    <P>The particular circumstances associated with the infection of haemophiliacs with both hepatitis C and HIV have been investigated at the Lindsay tribunal, which was established in September 1999. Deputies will recall the graphic testimony of haemophiliacs who are infected with hepatitis C and HIV. The evidence presented by the families of those who died from hepatitis C or HIV was especially moving. The House awaits the report of the tribunal, which will address the role of treating physicians and State agencies who had a responsibility in regard to the treatment and care of such persons.</P>
    <P>In 1999, during discussions between my Department and the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to the terms of reference of the Lindsay tribunal, the society raised the question of compensation for haemophiliacs with HIV. The society considered that the 1991 settlement was inadequate and did not represent fair compensation. In particular, the society pointed out that whereas the hepatitis C claims are calculated on the basis of awards of the High Court, the 1991 settlement did not provide compensation in line with that available in the High Court in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the light of the very strong representations made by the society on behalf of its members, the Government and my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, accepted in December 1999 that it would be fair and equitable to compensate HIV infected haemophiliacs and dependants of deceased HIV infected haemophiliacs in a similar way to persons infected with hepatitis C. The Government committed itself to bringing forward proposals following detailed discussions with the society which would achieve the objective of ensuring compensation for HIV haemophiliacs and their families on a similar basis to those per<Col N="132" /> sons infected with hepatitis C, subject to such modifications as might be necessary to take account of the special circumstances of those infected with HIV and their dependants. Detailed discussions followed between the society and its legal advisers and my Department and its legal advisers. It was accepted by all the relevant parties that the circumstances involved were unique and that the development of compensation proposals would be extremely complex. The fact that there had been a full and final settlement in 1991 was one of the complicating factors.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legal complexities, the preparation of proposals was unfortunately delayed due to the fact that both the society and my Department were heavily involved in the Lindsay tribunal. It was necessary for my Department to devote considerable time and commitment to its participation in the tribunal. The tribunal heard evidence during 196 days and completed its public hearings on 28 November 2001. The involvement of the Department in the tribunal significantly affected the timescales involved in bringing forward proposals to the House.</P>
    <P>The special circumstances of persons infected with HIV and their dependants was the subject of detailed submissions by the society. The society has extensive experience in dealing with HIV and its tragic impact on so many lives. It is, therefore, uniquely and ideally placed to advise on the special circumstances associated with HIV. It also has members who are infected with hepatitis C, some of whom have died arising from their infection.</P>
    <P>I wish to summarise for the House the special circumstances relating to HIV which the society has outlined to me. HIV infection in the 1980s and early 1990s was effectively a death sentence with little if any effective treatment options apart from palliative care measures; those infected became seriously ill very quickly and died harrowing deaths; many died relatively young, including some children; the rapid deterioration of the health of those infected was extremely difficult for their families; the stigma and fear associated with the virus, especially around the time of the bereavement, added immensely to the trauma and suffering of the family; the support and counselling services for the primary victims and their families was wholly inadequate and this inadequacy aggravated the pain and suffering; and there was a significant risk of onward transmission of HIV, especially in sexual relations.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I, on behalf of the Government, have reached agreement with the society which resolves the issue of additional compensation arising from the HIV infection. The principal terms of this agreement are as follows: persons who are infected with HIV from the administration of blood products within the State will have access to the compensation tribunal; dependants of those HIV infected haemophiliacs who have died will be entitled to claim the general damages, including pain and suffering, to which the deceased would be entitled were <Col N="133" /> he or she in a position to make his or her claim to the tribunal; dependants will also be entitled to claim for financial loss arising from the injury and death of the person with HIV; a dependent spouse, child, mother or father may claim if he or she has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the death of the primary victim; dependent spouses or children may claim for the loss of society, including the loss of care, companionship and affection, of the deceased; and a spouse or partner may claim in respect of the loss of consortium, including the impairment of sexual relations, arising from the risk of the transmission of HIV.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extremely complex as it not only amends the current Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, but also contains a novel approach to compensate the widows and children of persons who died from hepatitis C or HIV. The Bill provides that the dependants may claim for the general damages, mainly pain and suffering, that the deceased would have been entitled to if he or she had survived and brought a claim to the compensation tribunal. This is a significant departure from the civil liability provisions which exclude the dependants from claiming the pain and suffering of the deceased. The Government approved this provision because those who died of HIV were not in a position to make a claim on their own behalf before their death.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the Civil Liability Acts, dependants may only claim from the date of death of the deceased and not from the date of injury. I have included a provision which will allow the dependants claim for financial loss from the date of injury. This will enable dependants to be awarded compensation, for example, where the deceased was unable to work because of his or her illness and the dependants lost out financially.</P>
    <P>In breaking new ground in relation to damages I am very conscious of the challenges these provisions will have for the compensation tribunal. It is the tribunal which will be charged with the assessment of such damages and there is no case law in this country for some of the elements I have outlined. Indeed, I suspect that there will be little if any case law in any other jurisdiction. The tribunal has, however, extensive experience and expertise in the assessment of injuries in relation to hepatitis C and I have no doubt it will be well capable of addressing these complex matters.</P>
    <P>I turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill. Section 1 defines various terms used in the Bill. I draw attention to the definition of &ldquo;relevant product&rdquo; which is defined as a blood product or a blood component used to treat persons with haemophilia or other blood clotting disorders in respect of those conditions. As Deputies will be aware, the use of such products has been implicated with the transmission of HIV to members of the haemophilia community here.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for a change in the title of the compensation tribunal, which in future will be known as the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation <Col N="134" /> Tribunal. The references in any Act or regulation to the tribunal will be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for two technical amendments of section 3 of the 1997 Act. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) provides that certain notices which may be issued by the tribunal may be delivered to the place where a person to whom the notice is directed carries on any trade, business or profession rather than delivering it to his or her home address. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) inserts a new provision in the 1997 Act which provides that certain requirements of the tribunal may be enforced by High Court. These may require a person to attend the tribunal to give evidence or produce documents to the tribunal. The compensation tribunal has received full co-operation from all relevant State agencies, doctors and others. Nevertheless, it is considered desirable to make such provision now that we have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for a series of amendments to section 4 of the 1997 Act. Paragraph (<i>a</i>)(i) is a technical amendment to clarify the intention of section 4(1)(<i>c</i>) of the 1997 Act. Paragraph (<i>a</i>)(ii) amends the provision in the 1997 Act in relation to carers of persons with hepatitis C. The existing provision enables a carer to make a claim for financial loss or expenses he or she has incurred. This is now being extended to include financial loss or expenses which he or she will incur. Paragraph (<i>a</i>)(iii) extends the categories of persons who may apply for compensation to the tribunal to include persons affected by HIV infection.</P>
    <P>The new provisions are at paragraphs (<i>f</i>), (<i>g</i>), (<i>h</i>), (<i>i</i>) and (<i>j</i>). Paragraphs (<i>e</i>) and (<i>k</i>) already appear in the 1997 Act and are being repeated here for drafting reasons. Paragraph (<i>f</i>) refers to a person who has been diagnosed positive for HIV as result of receiving a relevant product within the State. Paragraph (<i>g</i>) refers to children or spouses of such a person who have been infected with HIV. Paragraph (<i>h</i>) refers to a person who is married to or cohabiting with an infected person and enables that spouse or partner to make a claim for loss of consortium, including impairment of sexual relations arising from the risk of transmission of HIV. Paragraph (<i>i</i>) enables a person who is responsible for the care of a HIV infected person to make a claim for the financial loss or expenses he or she has incurred or will incur. Paragraph (<i>j</i>) enables dependants of HIV infected persons who have died to make a claim for compensation to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 4(<i>b</i>) inserts a new provision after section 4(2) of the 1997 Act which provides that a person may not be entitled to make a claim to the tribunal if he or she has received an award from any court or a settlement arising out of the circumstances which could give rise to a claim at the tribunal. The new subsection (2A) provides that this prohibition will not apply to any person who has received a payment under the 1991 settlement or an award from any court, including an award from a court on appeal from the tribunal, or a payment in respect of an action <Col N="135" /> against a party other than the State or a relevant agency. This provision is necessary to ensure the persons who received payments under the 1991 settlement or in settlement of litigation against the pharmaceutical companies are not debarred from making a claim to the tribunal. It will also ensure co-infected persons, that is, persons infected with both hepatitis C and HIV, will not be debarred from making a claim in respect of their HIV condition where they have previously received an award in respect of hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Section 4(<i>c</i>) inserts a new subsection (6A). Paragraph (<i>a</i>) requires claimants to advise the tribunal whether he or she has previously made a claim to the tribunal or received a payment under the 1991 settlement. In the case of claims by dependants, the dependants will also be asked to indicate whether the deceased person had previously made a claim to the tribunal or received a payment under the 1991 settlement. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) authorises the Minister to furnish the tribunal with particulars of the 1991 settlement if the tribunal requires this in order to process any particular claim. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that persons making their first claim after the commencement of the Bill will be required to make one claim only in respect of all their heads of damages. This will enable the tribunal to consider all aspects of a particular case and help to eliminate duplication and delay. I propose to bring forward a technical amendment of this provision tomorrow. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) is a transitional provision which provides that where there are claims pending before the Bill comes into force, the tribunal may deal with these and any fresh claims from the same claimant at the same time if it considers this appropriate. Section 4(<i>d</i>) is a cross-referencing adjustment.</P>
    <P>Section 4(<i>e</i>) sets out the proofs which persons making claims in relation to HIV infection will be required to satisfy on the balance of probabilities. An HIV infected person will be required to show that his or her infection resulted from the use of a relevant product within the State. Children or spouses infected via an infected person will be required to show that this was the source of their infection. Carers will be required to show that the HIV infected person they are looking after was infected following the receipt of a relevant product. Dependants will be required to show that the deceased was infected following the receipt of a relevant product.</P>
    <P>Section 4(<i>f</i>) provides that in making a claim for aggravated or exemplary damages a claimant may rely on the facts found in any report of the tribunal of inquiry into the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia, that is, the report of the Lindsay tribunal. Section 4(<i>g</i>) is a cross-referencing adjustment.</P>
    <P>Section 4(<i>h</i>) sets out the time limits within which claimants must bring claims arising from the infection of persons with HIV. These follow the format used in the 1997 Act in relation to hepatitis C claims. In summary, the time limit is <Col N="136" /> three years from the date of the relevant event, for example, the date of injury or date of death, or three years from the date of commencement of the Bill, whichever is the later. Paragraphs (<i>i</i>) and (<i>j</i>) are cross-referencing adjustments.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 5 of the 1997 Act which sets out the basis on which awards are to be calculated by the compensation tribunal. Generally, the tribunal is required to apply the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of torts and relevant statutory provisions, including Part 4 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961. The new section 5 provides for a series of important and novel modifications of the usual rules covering personal injury actions and fatal claims. These modifications are required to take account of the special circumstances in which we find ourselves legislating to compensate HIV infected persons and their dependants many years after the event.</P>
    <P>Section 5(<i>a</i>) contains three significant modifications to the way in which dependency claims are usually handled which will be of significant financial advantage to the dependants of deceased HIV infected persons. The first provision in paragraph (<i>a</i>) provides that damages in a dependency claim will accrue from the date of injury of the deceased rather than from the date of death of the deceased which is the usual rule. The second modification at paragraph (<i>b</i>) enables the tribunal to make an award to a dependant consisting of an amount equal to the amount of general damages, including damages for pain and suffering which the deceased suffered during his or her lifetime and to which the deceased would have been entitled had he or she survived and brought a claim for compensation to the tribunal. This is a ground breaking provision. Normally, as I have explained, damages for pain and suffering can only be recovered by the primary victim, not by his or her dependants. However, the situation with which we are dealing is unique and the usual rules should be set aside in this instance.</P>
    <P>The third modification is as paragraph (<i>c</i>) which allows the tribunal to make an award to a dependant in respect of aggravated and exemplary damages if the dependant can establish that the deceased would have had a legal entitlement to such damages against a relevant agency or the Minister had he or she survived. This is another significant departure from the existing law under which aggravated and exemplary damages are only payable to the primary victim, not his or her dependants.</P>
    <P>Section 5(<i>b</i>) makes special provision for the children, spouses, fathers or mothers or persons who died as a result of contracting HIV or hepatitis C or where either of those conditions was a significant contributory factor to the cause of death. The tribunal is being empowered to make an award to such a dependant in respect of post-traumatic stress disorder or nervous shock they suffered arising from the death of their loved one. I have already alluded to the graphic testimony given at the Lindsay tribunal and also at the Fin<Col N="137" /> lay tribunal of the devastating impact that such deaths have had on family members. This will allow the tribunal to make awards of damages for post-traumatic stress disorder, also known as nervous shock, in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Section 5(<i>b</i>) inserts a new section 5(3B) into the 1997 Act. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) will enable the tribunal to make an award in respect of the loss of consortium, including the impairment of sexual relations suffered by a person who is married to or the partner of an infected person arising from the risk of transmission of HIV. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) allows certain dependants of persons with HIV, that is, children or spouses, to make a claim in respect of the loss of society of the deceased, including the loss of care, companionship and affection of their loved one. Following representations I have received from the society as well as from Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, I propose to bring forward an amendment to extend this provision in two respects: first, to extend the provision to parents of the deceased and, second, to extend the entire provision to dependants of persons infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (3D) provides that in considering the claim of a HIV infected person, the spouse or partner, or the carer, of such a person of such a person, the tribunal may consider any award previously made by it or by the High Court on an appeal and may consider any payment made to that person under the 1991 settlement. I give notice of my intention to bring forward an amendment to delete paragraph (<i>a</i>)(i) and (<i>b</i>)(i) of subsection (3D). This is in response to discussions I had earlier today with the society. I will deal with the matter in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 5(<i>c</i>) provides that the making of an award arising from the infection of a person with HIV will not serve to revive any claims that were discharged or waived under the 1991 settlement and is also without prejudice to any indemnity given under that settlement. Section 5(<i>d</i>) and 5(<i>e</i>) are minor technical provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 5(<i>f</i>) and 5(<i>g</i>) provide for the extension of certain time limits. Paragraph (<i>f</i>) provides that a person making a claim may decide whether to seek a single lump sum award or a provisional award up to the conclusion of the hearing rather than at the commencement of the hearing as is currently the case. Paragraph (<i>g</i>) enables the Minister to extend by regulation the period of one month within which awards by the tribunal to minors must be submitted to the High Court for approval. Provision is also made for an extension of the time available to a claimant who is a minor to make up his or her mind as to whether to accept an award. In the special circumstances which apply in respect of awards to minors, it has been represented to me that the period of one month may be too short and this will enable me to extend the relevant period.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an amendment of section 9 of the 1997 Act. That section enables the Minister by regulation to extend the class or classes of <Col N="138" /> persons who may bring a claim for compensation to the tribunal. That provision was used by my predecessor some years ago to allow certain relatives of hepatitis C-infected persons who had themselves become infected to apply for compensation. The main effect of this provision will be to enable the Minister to make similar regulations in relation to persons infected with HIV.</P>
    <P>Section 7 amends section 10 of the 1997 Act. That section provides for the establishment of a special account which is used to fund awards made by the tribunal. In 1998, regulations were made by my predecessor to enable funds from the special account to be used to pay awards made by the High Court on appeal from the tribunal. The opportunity is being taken to consolidate the provisions of those regulations into primary legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for amendments to section 11 of the 1997 Act. That section provides for the establishment of a reparation fund from which an additional amount equivalent to 20% of the tribunal's award is paid to persons <i>in lieu</i> of aggravated or exemplary damages. The 1998 regulations which I mentioned a moment ago were used to enable payments from the reparation fund to be made in a case of awards by the High Court on appeal from the tribunal. The opportunity is being taken in paragraph (<i>a</i>) to consolidate that provision into primary legislation. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) is designed to remove any possible ambiguity relating to the interaction of section 5(7) and section 11 of the 1997 Act. It makes clear that where a claimant has received a provisional award and returns to the tribunal for further compensation under section 5(7), he or she will be entitled to have a 20% top-up payment from the reparation fund. This will also apply in the case of awards from the High Court on appeal under section 5(7).</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that if any difficulty arises during the first 12 months of the operation of the Bill, the Minister may by regulation do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing the provisions into operation. In normal circumstances, one would hesitate to include such a provision in legislation. However, a similar provision in the 1997 Act proved its worth and it is desirable that we should have such a facility available in the event of difficulties arising during the first 12 months of the operation of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that nothing in this Act or in section 5(10)(<i>a</i>) of the 1997 Act shall prevent a person from instituting or continuing proceedings for damages by a party other than the State and the other parties to the 1991 settlement. This will ensure that there is no interference with ongoing litigation between certain haemophiliacs and certain pharmaceutical companies. Section 11 contains the usual provisions in relation to Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement. The Act will come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may fix by order. It is my intention that the Act will come into <Col N="139" /> operation at a very early date. As soon as the Bill is passed my officials will make contact with the compensation tribunal to agree a time scale for the commencement of the legislation.</P>
    <P>It was both the Government's and the society's priority that a Bill would be brought before the House this week. This objective has been achieved as a result of considerable and exhaustive efforts by staff in my Department and in the Attorney General's office. I record my appreciation of the substantial efforts of all those involved. I acknowledge the co-operation of Opposition Deputies in facilitating the discussion tonight on this Bill and their assistance in ensuring that it has a speedy passage through the Dáil. I apologise for and regret the late presentation of the Bill to the Deputies last evening. There were certain issues that had to be resolved late yesterday which delayed the handing over of the Bill to Opposition Deputies. I regret that and I understand the difficulties caused to Deputies. I would of course welcome their reflections on the Bill during this debate and tomorrow on Committee, Report and Final Stages.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record of the House an extract from the statement which was made on my behalf at the Lindsay tribunal.</P>
    <P>I and my Department very much regret the pain and suffering caused to all of those who have been infected by blood and blood products and acknowledge that the impact on the haemophilia community has been particularly devastating. The toll in human lives has been great and the loss of so many children is a tragedy of immense proportions. That such an immense tragedy should befall citizens of this State whilst availing themselves of State health services is a matter of profound regret.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the limited time available to me, I hope that I can do justice to the important legislation before us. The Minister got it wrong when he said that it was a priority of his and the Irish Haemophilia Society to have this Bill passed this evening &ndash; it was their priority to have this Bill passed last year. The Minister promised this Bill last autumn and Deputy McManus and I have been standing up on the Order of Business day in, day out looking for the Bill. Now that we are in the 95th minute of extra time, the Bill has been put before the House in this way. I accept the Minister's statement of regret but, from an Opposition point of view, to receive this legislation by fax to my home at 10.45 p.m. on the night before we were to take the Bill is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put that on the record because I have been a while in this House and know that sometimes when the detail of legislation is looked at it does not mean what it was first thought to mean. I hope that the Irish Haemophilia Society, Positive Action and others, when they read this Bill in time to come, or when lawyers read it on their <Col N="140" /> behalf or judges read it under challenge, find that what they thought was in the Bill is in it. The Minister said that this is an extremely complex Bill. I agree and that is why I am concerned at the rush with which it is being taken. If it was for any other purpose, I would not agree with it being taken tonight. It is only because of the suffering that has been endured that I agree. I suggest to all who have an interest in this Bill that they have it examined in great detail. I have been around for long enough to know that the devil is in the detail. If we do not have time to reflect on legislation, we may do a disservice to those we are attempting to serve tonight.</P>
    <P>Tonight is another step on the road to righting a terrible wrong. Some of our fellow citizens had their lives damaged and, in some cases, ended tragically and prematurely due to the action of a State body in supplying infected blood to fellow citizens. It is not a day for point-scoring but rather a day to apologise and to finally give the victims access to an adequate compensation scheme. In case this matter ever comes up for challenge or consideration, I want to record some of the concerns raised by the Irish Haemophilia Society, which the Minister says we are addressing tonight and which I hope in the detail we are helping.</P>
    <P>The society said that by virtue of the introduction by the Government of additional restrictions in the draft Bill, it found it impossible to support the draft legislation as it stood. It saw the attempt by the Minister to introduce a punitive requirement at the last moment without the advance knowledge of the society as an attempt to penalise persons with haemophilia for having been infected with both viruses. The society accepted that the loss of earnings may be taken into account but utterly rejected any proposal that the pain and suffering of a person with haemophilia, and infected with both HIV and hepatitis C, should be taken into account in any deduction in this area.</P>
    <P>The society already indicated that to the Minister. It said, for example, that if a driver knocks down a pedestrian and the pedestrian sustains a broken arm, pursues a claim which is settled and years later the same driver knocks down the same pedestrian causing a leg injury, the driver would not expect that the award for the leg injury could be reduced or a deduction would be made in respect of the amount of the second injury because he discharged his obligation for compensation on the first injury. The Irish Haemophilia Society expressed its extreme disappointment that the opportunity for fair and equitable compensation for people with haemophilia infected with HIV was now diminishing rapidly due to the introduction of a section in the draft legislation. I wish to put that on the record because there were reasonable concerns about the draft Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope that this will be an adequate scheme. I am guided by the attitude of the representatives of those infected, in particular the Irish Haemophilia Society. I note the society's concern that <Col N="141" /> the compensation tribunal would take into account any previous awards for compensation made to an applicant by it or by the High Court. I note the precise concerns about section 5(<i>b</i>)(3D)(<i>a</i>) expressed by the Irish Haemophilia Society, if the Minister's intention is to merely protect the State from the risk of double payment in regard to loss of earnings. I wish to put their argument on the record and I ask the Minister to confirm in his reply that in both spirit and detail these concerns have been met. The Irish Haemophilia Society proposes that:</P>
    <P>In considering the claim of a person referred to in paragraph (f), (g) or (i) of the Tribunal&ndash;</P>
    <P>(iii) may consider any award of Special Damages in regard to loss of earnings previously made by it or by the High Court on an appeal from the Tribunal to the person, and</P>
    <P>(iv) may consider any payment made to the person under the 1991 settlement.</P>
    <P>The society's arguments to the Minister were as follows: the present law allows the Tribunal to calculate damages on the same basis as an award of the High Court by the application of the principles of the laws of tort and with reference to any relevant statutory provision; an award of the High Court and the application of the principles of the laws of tort mean if a person is injured in two separate events such person has two separate causes of action; infection with hepatitis C and infection with HIV represent two separate and distinct events, each of which give rise to a separate cause of action, and there is no overlap between the occurrence of hepatitis C and the separate occurrence of HIV; the present law allows all the circumstances of an individual's claim including his medical history to be taken into account. The amended section will allow the tribunal take a previous award itself into account and not the circumstances of the award; in doing so the tribunal will have powers greater than those of the High Court &ndash; a High Court judge is obliged to take all the circumstances into account, not just the amount of the award; distinguishing HIV/hepatitis C co-infected person's right to compensation in this way is in breach of their constitutional right to access before the Courts and to equal treatment before the law as is contained in Article 34 and Article 41 of the Constitution; applying the rules of statutory interpretation, the section must have a purpose or else it is meaningless, its purpose being to increase the power of the tribunal, allowing it to take previous awards into account so as to reduce awards of compensation for persons with HIV/HCV co-infection. The result is either the section is meaningless, confirming section 5 as it stands, or it has the meaning of giving the tribunal more power than that of a High Court judge; and the Irish Haemophilia Society acknowledges that compensation for loss of earnings in an award of compensation for hepatitis C infection may be taken into <Col N="142" /> account in any subsequent award of compensation for HIV provided the circumstances so warrant, as permitted by the present section 5.</P>
    <P>Given that there is very little time to consider this Bill this evening I ask the Minister to confirm that all of those concerns have been addressed both in the spirit and in the content of the legislation. I am informed that these concerns were finally and with some difficulty addressed today. I presume this will mean amendments will be made to the Bill on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to confirm to the House that those amendments will meet all those concerns.</P>
    <P>However, I am also aware of concerns expressed by Positive Action, the hepatitis C/anti-D support group. They feel the Bill creates an invidious distinction between those infected with hepatitis C and those infected with HIV. They seek limited amendments to the Bill and I will be moving such amendments on Committee Stage to include partners and spouses of people with hepatitis C in section 4; to include partners and spouses in section 5(<i>b</i>)(3B)(<i>a</i>); to include children and spouses of persons who died as a result of having contracted Hepatitis C in section 5(<i>b</i>)(3B)(<i>b</i>). I am asking the Minister to take these concerns on board. It is not clear from what the Minister said here this evening whether his amendments meet those concerns.</P>
    <P>The main argument being made by the Minister is that the rate of transmission via sexual intercourse is greater from HIV than hepatitis C. These concerns have been expressed to me by Positive Action and it is important that they be addressed in the House. Hepatitis C can be transmitted via sexual intercourse and in fact has been transmitted in this way to the partners of women infected with hepatitis C from contaminated anti-D. Transmission is a possibility and people with hepatitis C are advised by their doctors to consider changing their sexual practices and to take extra precautions when they are diagnosed with hepatitis C. A recently published booklet called Living with Hepatitis C, produced by the Consultative Council on Hepatitis C, an advisory body to the Minister, advises people on this very issue. This is a matter of principle for Positive Action. In their view each individual should be able or allowed to state their case to the tribunal which will then judge the merits of each case. By excluding some victims from being able to do this the Minister is proposing something that is fundamentally discriminatory, unfair and unacceptable. The concerns raised by Positive Action should be addressed by the Minister in his reply to Second Stage so that they can be addressed tomorrow on Committee Stage. It is very wrong, given the history of this entire debacle, that two groups of people infected by blood products administered by State agencies should be treated differently. People were unaware that they had been infected with hepatitis C for many years and most people only became aware in the early 1990s. Many marriages and relationships had broken down because of fatigue, depression and general debili<Col N="143" /> tation because of infection. Fear of infection was not a feature of the breakdown of marriages because people did not know they were infected. Relationships had broken down and in many more cases relationships broke down or were damaged when the diagnosis was made. Fear of transmission was then an element in the circumstances. Loss of society affects all the families of those who have died as a result of hepatitis C. The Minister is introducing an invidious discrimination and one which is of great concern to Positive Action. Consortium involves the totality of relationships between men and women and is a wider concept than that of impairment of sexual relations. They are the concerns which Positive Action have expressed to me. I ask the Minister to tell the House whether his proposed amendments fully meet the concerns of Positive Action or are there still matters of concern which he has not addressed?</P>
    <P>The scale of the wrong done to our fellow citizens and their colleagues with hepatitis C beggars belief. It is time for a generous and full settlement. Through the Finlay and Lindsay tribunals we have sought to get to the root of what went wrong. It seems that difficulties in getting access to records in the United States may mean that we never get the full truth, but we now know enough and it is clear a terrible wrong was done.</P>
    <P>The failure of the State to properly provide, until now, for these citizens whom State bodies infected is truly shocking. Everybody in the House now accepts that. We all now know and acknowledge the mistakes made in dealing with the case of Mrs. McCole and other hepatitis C sufferers. Many of those now temporally residing on the Government benches criticised how the State behaved in those cases. It is a terrible indictment of their cynicism and lack of real interest in the plight of the victims of State infection that it took the threat of further court actions and an imminent general election to finally bring the Government to its senses and to introduce this legislation this evening.</P>
    <P>The legislation is being rushed through. As an Opposition spokesperson I only received the draft Bill late last night, which is unacceptable. I am worried that in the rush we may not do sufficient and long overdue justice to those wronged by the State. I recognise the need to resolve this matter quickly given that 64 haemophiliacs have already died from HIV as a result of receiving contaminated blood products. Why has it taken five long years to bring this proposal forward and why even now did the Minister drag his heels on introducing a scheme acceptable to the victims? I am afraid that to the end, meeting the real needs of those wronged by the State does not seem to have been given sufficient priority by a Government obsessed by glossy launches, taskforces and forums, but precious little action.</P>
    <P>I hope that tonight we are taking an important step. I hope that with proper financial compen<Col N="144" /> sation put in place and the advances in the treatment of HIV the victims can make a better life after these appalling events. This must never happen again. Never again must people die while negotiations continue. I hope that is something we on both sides of this House have learned. Let us agree a settlement now, which is fair to the victims, and let them and their families have some closure and a chance to get on with rebuilding lives shattered by this negligence.</P>
    <P>I will briefly address some of the contents of the Bill. As it was circulated so late, I need some clarification. If the Minister is not in a position to give this to me this evening he might arrange to get it to me. The interpretation section mentions: &ldquo;&lsquo;the 1991 settlement&rdquo; means the agreement made in 1991 . . .&rdquo;  Are those words now necessary or is it intended to take that out of the definition?</P>
    <P>Section 3 states:</P>
    <P>Where a person refuses or fails to comply with or disobeys a requirement of the Tribunal, the High Court may, on application to it in a summary manner in that behalf by the Tribunal, order the person to comply with the requirement . . .</P>
    <P>I have not had a chance to cross-reference this with the principal Act. What penalties apply? Are they the normal contempt of court penalties or are there other specific provisions? Is section 4(<i>c</i>)(6A)(<i>a</i>)(ii) necessary? It states: &ldquo;whether he or she received a payment under the 1991 settlement&rdquo;. Are those sections being left in or will they be deleted from the Bill?</P>
    <P>I have not had time to take advice on section 5. Section 5(<i>b</i>)(3A)(<i>a</i>) states:</P>
    <P>. . . the Tribunal may make an award to that dependant in respect of post-traumatic stress disorder or nervous shock if he or she satisfies the Tribunal that he or she has suffered or is suffering from that condition as a result of the death.</P>
    <P>Will it only to apply as a result of a death? Are there no other circumstances when this form of post-traumatic stress disorder or nervous shock will be compensated?</P>
    <P>Section 5(<i>b</i>)(3B)(<i>b</i>) refers to: &ldquo;. . . the loss of the care, companionship and affection of the deceased as a result of the death.&rdquo;  Is the compensation only to run from the time of death? What about any loss of society, care or companionship during the illness itself?</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister's main amendments will relate to section 5(<i>b</i>)(3D)(<i>a</i>) and 5(<i>b</i>)(3D)(<i>b</i>) in order to meet the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society. I ask the Minister to let us have those amendments as early as possible so that we can study them and prepare for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister can tell us his intentions regarding section 6(1) of the Bill. It states:</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;in respect of <Col N="145" /> Hepatitis C or HIV and may by regulations amend or modify this Act for the purpose of enabling this Act to apply appropriately to the class or classes so extended&rdquo;. . .</P>
    <P>How will these regulations be made? Will they be laid before the House and nullified only if we do not rescind them or will they be put before the House for positive affirmation? Either way I presume the Minister will lay the regulations before the House, but will they be dealt with by way of negative or positive amendment? A similar question on the regulations applies to section 9, which covers the power to remove difficulties. Are these regulations which will be laid before the House and we can rescind or will they come before the House for positive affirmation?</P>
    <P>Section 8(<i>b</i>) states:</P>
    <P>Where a claimant accepts an award of further compensation from the Tribunal under section 5(7) or from the High Court on an appeal from the Tribunal against that award, the claimant may apply to have an amount paid to him or her from the Fund.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister said that section 7 amends section 10 of the 1997 Act and that section provides for the establishment of a special account that is used to fund awards made by the tribunal. I am working from the draft I got last night and I do not know if the green draft I got this afternoon is any different. The Minister referred to section 7 of the Bill but I am raising this question under section 8. In any event it is the same question. Is this an account with funds in it or how is it financed? Is it financed occasionally? The same query applies to the reparation fund mentioned on page 13 of the draft, which states: &ldquo;in case of High Court awards on appeal from the Tribunal&rdquo;. What is the status of those funds? Where are they kept? Is the account financed only as awards are made?</P>
    <P>Section 11(3) states:</P>
    <P>This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as, by order or orders made by the Minister under this section, may be fixed therefor.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would consult with the tribunal and try to bring this into effect as soon as possible. Can he confirm that &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; means not later than, for example, 30 days? Is that the sort of timescale he has in mind? I am pleased to see the Bill before the Dáil even at this late hour. I hope that in passing it in this hurried way, we will not do anyone an injustice. It is not a good way to make legislation. I hope the lawyers on behalf of the Irish Haemophilia Society and Positive Active have had adequate time to digest the legislation.</P>
    <P>If there are five Supreme Court judges, three may interpret a Bill in one way, while the other two could interpret it in another way. The purpose of our job as legislators is to tease out all legislation, section by section, on Committee Stage and express our concerns by raising issues. <Col N="146" /> I hope that by dealing with this Bill hurriedly, we will not pass into law something that is not intended.</P>
    <P>People may think that cannot happen but I recall the debate in this House on Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. Many people told us that was a necessary pro-life amendment to the Constitution and that the wording meant only one thing. At that time I took advice from a senior lawyer who asked me, &ldquo;Are you concerned to enact something which is pro-life?&rdquo; As a new Deputy in the early 1980s, I certainly was. The lawyer said, however, &ldquo;Do not vote for that legislation because you are giving the Supreme Court the right to interpret the legislation in any way it wishes.&rdquo; After a long debate during which we had an opportunity to digest that Bill, nobody would have believed that in the very first case taken to the Supreme Court it would have interpreted the legislation not to mean what the Legislature thought and what the people thought it meant when they had voted for it. That is why I have raised these concerns in this debate. I will be supporting Second Stage of the Bill and I will raise more of these issues on Committee Stage tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Mitchell and the Minister, I am conscious of the context within which we are having this debate &ndash; that is, the worst tragedy that has been experienced in the history of the modern health service. It is not doing the issue a good service to debate a Bill that is being rushed through the House. It is impossible for me, as a member of the Opposition, to do my job properly because of the approach that is being taken by the Government. I obviously welcome the Bill in principle, but it is wrong to corrode the parliamentary process in the way the Government has done.</P>
      <P>This is a complex Bill and Opposition Deputies have a duty to ensure that it is the best possible Bill that can be agreed upon and passed by the House, not one that has not been subjected to proper scrutiny or fully assessed by the legal back-up we have, limited though it is. My experience has been that on a number of occasions, legislation coming from the Department of Health and Children has not been fully in accord with best practice. Indeed, the Minister has had to bring forward many amendments to legislation, even though one would expect the homework had been done and the preparation was complete.</P>
      <P>In this instance, the Bill came through our fax machines last night. We are debating Second Stage today and Committee Stage will be taken tomorrow. It is impossible to deal with legislation in this way. I apologise to people who, I hope, will benefit from the provisions of the Bill because I am simply unable to fulfil my obligations in fully scrutinising such complicated legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of the Government on the plight of haemophiliacs is one of very slow progress but now, facing a general election, a Bill is being rushed through the House. It is worth looking <Col N="147" /> back at the experience of the past five years. In 1997, the Fianna Fáil manifesto spelt out a commitment to establish a tribunal of inquiry to investigate matters of concern to the Irish Haemophilia Society, as well as certain other matters relating to the HIV infection of blood and blood products. Yet, it took until late September 1999 for that tribunal to be established. At the time, all of us in the House welcomed the establishment of the tribunal but concerns were expressed at a number of aspects of the terms of reference, concerns that, unfortunately, proved to be prophetic.</P>
    <P>One related to the investigation of international pharmaceutical companies and the restrictions, or, more accurately, the opt-out, permitted in the terms of reference. The Minister allowed for such an investigation but only as far as it was practicable, appropriate and reasonable. At the time, I urged that this caveat should not mean a lack of aggressive investigation of the role of international companies in relation to this scandal, but sadly it turned out to mean no investigation, aggressive or otherwise. We still do not know the extent of culpability of these powerful companies and until we do, the full story of this terrible tragedy will not be complete.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of concern was the issue of full disclosure of documentation. At the time of the debate, I asked that all documentation from the Minister's Department, the IBTS and the hospitals should be made available to the Irish Haemophilia Society. Of course, as we know, it did not turn out that way. Under pressure, the Minister for Health and Children conceded ground but to this day the IBTS has resisted efforts to ensure full accountability.</P>
    <P>Last but not least, there was the aspect of revisiting the issue of compensation which we are debating tonight. In June 1999, during the debate on the establishment of the tribunal I said:</P>
    <P>The Government has given a welcome commitment to review the adequacy of the compensation package to ensure a fair and equitable settlement. It must also be a swift settlement as we are dealing, in many cases, with a race against time. There must not be a repeat of the two and a half year delay experienced in getting to this point. I understand that a simple change in legislation may be all that is required in regard to the issue but it is vital that the Minister expresses a determination to deal with this issue fairly and to commit himself to a speedy settlement. I am aware that at the same time the Cabinet agreed to the draft terms of reference for the tribunal, a decision was also made to re-open the compensation issue.</P>
    <P>First, it did not require just a simple adjustment of legislation but it took a very long time to extract this legislation, even though it has been on the Order Paper and members of the Opposition have raised the issue on a number of occasions on the Order of Business. Looking at <Col N="148" /> the record, it seems that there has been a lot of obfuscation, hesitation and, indeed, brinkmanship by the Minister in engaging with those infected with HIV and hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Even when the Bill was published last night, it was found to have significant flaws, first, in relation to the rights of people who contracted HIV as well as hepatitis C and, second, because it appears to create a new distinction for victims of contaminated blood and blood products, between those who are haemophiliacs and contracted HIV, and those who are not haemophiliacs but have contracted hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>This afternoon, at the 11th hour, the Minister had discussions on the Bill with the Irish Haemophilia Society. He resolved one issue but it appears that he has left another unresolved or, certainly, not fully resolved. The Minister has indicated that he will amend the Bill but as I read it, he has not dealt completely with the issues raised by Positive Action. However, I do not have his amendments so we will have to debate them tomorrow on Committee Stage without preparation.</P>
    <P>This provision must be welcomed, of course, as must the fact that the Irish Haemophilia Society is supportive of the legislation. However, the way in which the Bill has been published and rushed through the Oireachtas, as we approach a general election, is simply disgraceful. It has been produced magically from the Attorney General's office and the Minister is now rushing it through the House, even though he knows, more than anybody, that it is a matter for concern for other groups such as Positive Action and Transfusion Positive. They have made clear, publicly, their opposition, not to the principles of the Bill, but to the knock-on impact it may have for their members.</P>
    <P>I object strenuously to the way the Bill has been handled. It was received last night by spokespersons on the Opposition side, with no explanatory memorandum attached. I cannot recall a similar situation, during my time in the House since 1992, when an explanatory memorandum was not provided with a Bill, not just to facilitate us &ndash; we are simply here to do our job &ndash; but to inform the public at large of exactly what we are doing in this Parliament. What we are debating should not be a secret, obfuscated or occluded in any way, yet that is exactly what has happened in this case. We are expected to take on trust that the Minister and the Department of Health and Children know what they are doing. I find it difficult to be fully confident in that regard.</P>
    <P>The nature of the consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society is not to the credit of the Minister or his Department. It involved a great deal of publicity. The society came to an arrangement with the Minister and was satisfied to go back to its members, stating the outstanding matters which it had brought to the Minister and the Department had been resolved. Then, suddenly, the Bill was published, including a provision that <Col N="149" /> had not been discussed and with which the society did not agree. There was an eleventh hour meeting today and the Minister has backed off. That is not the way to deal with legislation. I am glad the Minister made that decision, but it is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>One must ask whether this would be happening now if the general election was not imminent. We still have to hear the Minister's views in relation to a later meeting he had with the members of Positive Action and Transfusion Positive. Certainly, their impression has been that the issues &ndash; I will not repeat the points Deputy Gay Mitchell made &ndash; in relation to personal, intimate sexual relations have not been resolved. I find no indication in the Minister's speech that that has been taken on board, but look forward to his reply. The statement by Positive Action reads:</P>
    <P>The concern is that the Bill will introduce discrimination between HIV and hepatitis C victims in the manner in which their claims are to be dealt with in future. Whereas the partners of HIV victims are to be entitled to bring claims for loss of consortium and impairment of sexual relations, this is not being extended to the partners of hepatitis C victims. Equally importantly, the Bill proposes that, whereas the children and spouses of HIV victims are to be entitled to compensation for loss of society, care, companionship and affection of the deceased, this entitlement is not being extended to the children and spouses of hepatitis C victims who die.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain his position as to how he set out to create a discrimination and whether he now intends to address it fully. We have not got his amendments before us and, in a sense, have to presume either the best or the worst of his intentions. Clarity is most important in this regard. If the Minister does not deal with this matter fully, it will be an extraordinary anomaly to have created whereby he is dealing with one particular issue and, as a by-product, creating a whole new injustice to a group of people who have already experienced grave injustice on the part of the State. The Labour Party will table an amendment to deal with this discrimination. I hope the Minister will accept it or bring forward a more appropriate one.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the record of recent years, it is not one of which the Government can be proud, in terms of dealing with the Irish Haemophilia Society and how often it had to go public in order to get the response its members needed from the Department of Health and Children. In many ways, it was difficult for the society to have to go into the public arena and make its case yet again, but it did so with great dignity. I must pay tribute to the extraordinary resilience and commitment of the people in the society charged with the responsibility of making their case and overseeing what the Government was doing to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" />The stories which emerged from the Lindsay tribunal were harrowing. They made the general public and Members of the House much more aware of the horror of what was being experienced by the victims. On a daily basis, we heard from families of victims who had to watch their loved ones suffer and die, often with little or no support from the State. To compound their suffering, they were often &ndash; even up to this day &ndash; pushed from pillar to post in pursuit of an investigation of their infection by blood products and compensation.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any idea at this stage as to the likely cost? I am aware of an estimate of &euro;100 million. It would be helpful to have the Minister's comments. Obviously, the amount must be honoured. I am sure haemophiliacs and their families will forgive me for raising issues which, although not directly related, are still germane. This money must be earmarked and ring-fenced for this purpose, a point on which we are all at one. While the Government has produced a much vaunted health strategy, it has failed to provide the money to deliver on it. In relation to the compensation we are now discussing, we need to know, roughly, how much it will cost. Will it come from the existing budget for the Department of Health and Children or is there to be an additional allocation from the Department of Finance? How will it actually be implemented?</P>
    <P>Already, a disturbing volume of complaints are landing on my desk in relation to cutbacks and shortfalls in existing services in the health sector. The major hospitals have expressed concerns. There is also grave concern on the part of those dealing with people with disabilities. Step Enterprises, which operates under the auspices of the St. John of God institution and provides employment opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities and respite services in that regard, suffered a cutback in the 2002 budget, as a result of which it has been forced to stop providing a non-residential respite service. This is extremely serious and, even though it may be somewhat peripheral to the current debate, I urge the Minister to consider what has happened in relation to Step Enterprises and ensure the shortfall is met.</P>
    <P>The money now being allocated to provide compensation for haemophiliacs who contracted HIV must not be at the expense of any other person who needs to avail of health services. That is very important and it is something we all recognise. No reform favouring victims of such terrible injustice as has been experienced by haemophiliacs should ever be provided at the expense of any other group of vulnerable people, whether it is those who suffer disability or who contracted hepatitis C and were, in effect, poisoned by the State. That is the reality of the tragedy with which we are dealing. Women, children and men were injured in a terrible way by the State. Compensation, no matter how large or small, cannot undo that damage. It cannot bring back the dead, nor can it make the sick healthy. However, it is the <Col N="151" /> substance that confirms and underlines the words of regret which the Minister rightly restated tonight and which every Member of the House shares. It is overdue in the form of this Bill.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, the task is not fully complete. I hope that tomorrow we can reach agreement on the outstanding issues &ndash; they are not big and it is a matter of tweaking rather than fundamentally changing the provisions &ndash; and that the Bill will be passed by the House. Presumably it will be one of the last pieces of legislation to be passed by this Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate and I acknowledge the difficulties they have experienced in terms of being in a position to contribute. It is important that the legislation is passed for all the reasons that have been outlined.</P>
      <P>I indicated that it is our intention to delete section 5(<i>b</i>)(3D)(<i>a</i>)(i) and 5(<i>b</i>)(3D)(<i>b</i>)(i), which were the subject of the difficulty that arose with the published Bill last evening. To a certain extent there was a misunderstanding of the impact of these provisions. There was no attempt to reduce any reward or anything like that. When I reconsidered the matter this morning and following our meeting with the society this afternoon, it was pointed out that section 5 of the original Bill achieves the same purpose that was attempted to be achieved by the new subsections which, in essence, ensure that the normal High Court principles and the normal principles governing tort law would apply to the situation.</P>
      <P>There was agreement today on that. We decided that the cleanest way to resolve the difficulty that had arisen, which to a certain extent has been overstated, was to introduce an amendment deleting these subsections from the Bill. In this way the spirit and the letter of the issue have been adequately addressed. Our meeting today also addressed other minor amendments, to which I referred earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I met with Positive Action and Transfusion Positive I believe they accepted the bona fides of our position on the provision relating to the loss of consortium for haemophiliacs with HIV. The Irish Haemophilia Society made a strong submission on this issue. From the time people contracted HIV and so on, they were advised not to have sexual intercourse as there was very strong evidence about the high risk of transmission of infection, etc. The society made very detailed submissions on that point and it was in the context of these that we made the provision on the loss of consortium. It was not done to discriminate one group against another, but in good faith on the basis of a submission made by the society. To be fair to all the other groups, they accept the bona fides of the self-evident nature of the submission, given the enormous stigma attached to it at the time and also in terms of the medical advice people received. At that stage it <Col N="152" /> was a sentence of death and that was the basis on which the provision was made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the loss of society issue, which Positive Action and Transfusion Positive also raised this evening, I indicated that an amendment will be introduced to meet the concerns of both groups. We will also be giving wider consideration to the issue of consortium overnight and tomorrow during the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred to the issue of costs. There is a list of a range of issues by which we applied the agreement we reached with the Irish Haemophilia Society to the hepatitis C community as well. The following will apply in the case of hepatitis C. First, the dependants of hepatitis C victims who have died will be entitled to claim the general damages, including pain and suffering, to which the deceased would be entitled were he in a position to make his claim to the tribunal. Second, dependants of hepatitis C victims will also be entitled to claim for financial loss arising from the injury and death of the person with hepatitis C. Third, a dependent spouse, child, mother or father of hepatitis C victims may claim if they have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the death of the primary victim. I have indicated my intention to amend the Bill so that dependent spouses or children of hepatitis C victims may claim for the loss of society, including the loss of care, companionship and affection of the deceased. These new areas were agreed with the Irish Haemophilia Society and they are also being applied to the hepatitis C situation.</P>
    <P>I do not like to refer to costs, but the bulk of the overall package results from the extension of those issues to the hepatitis C community because of the greatly superior numbers in that community who where infected as a result of what happened. Overall, the package we have introduced is fair and it is additional to that which has been received in the context of the ongoing compensation tribunal. To be fair to all concerned, when one is commenting on this it is easy to dwell on one issue, but if one looks at the overall package it will be apparent that significant and genuine efforts have been made to facilitate equity of treatment across all the headings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to other issues. It did not take us five years to reach this stage. In 1999 the Government decided that the 1991 settlement needed to be added to. The Government also decided to reopen the case for haemophiliacs to provide for fair and equitable compensation. That did not happen prior to 1999 under successive Governments, of which both Deputies were members. Nor did it seem to arise. We can all be critical and seek to score points. I do not wish to do that, but given what the Opposition Deputies have said I must put that on the record. For almost a decade, from 1991 to 1999, nothing happened regarding the consideration or establishment of a compensation tribunal. Despite the fact that the Finlay tribunal was established to con<Col N="153" /> sider the hepatitis C issue and so on, it took until the late 1990s to establish the Lindsay tribunal of inquiry into the cause of the infection of haemophiliacs. That did not happen throughout the 1990s under successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge there have been difficulties. There is also a timeframe within which all this must be achieved. However, during the lifetime of this Government, the Lindsay tribunal was established and it made a huge impact on society in terms of the testimony that was given and so on. It left an enduring mark&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;on people's perspective on the wider issue of how haemophiliacs were infected and so forth. It led to the decision to amend the Act to provide for a new compensation arrangement. That is now happening.</P>
      <P>There are some details which can be dealt with more fully tomorrow. The provisions of the 1991 settlement will remain in the Act. I can get the details of the penalties for the Deputy later. Deputy Mitchell also asked about the regulations. They will come before the House in the traditional manner and can be nullified by the House. To do it another way could delay the commencement of the Act and the introduction of certain matters pertaining to its commencement. The regulations in relation to difficulties were provided for in the original Act establishing the hepatitis C compensation tribunal. They worked effectively for those who were making claims and for the representative groups. In other words, it is a facility that allows the Minister of the day to respond to genuine issues that arise in terms of whether the tribunal is working for certain categories and so forth. It enables the Minister to make amendments for the benefit of the two groups involved. Again, regulations would be laid before the House and if Members disagree, they can put down a motion to nullify them.</P>
      <P>I can get details of the special account for the Deputy tomorrow. It relates to Department of Finance arrangements with our Department with regard to how claims to the High Court etc. are handled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course. Deputy McManus raised the issue of cost. It will be separate to the health budget, as is the compensation being paid under the hepatitis C tribunal which is also ringfenced from the health budget. I reject the suggestion that there have been cutbacks in the health budget. There has been a substantial increase in the allocation to all health boards and the ERHA.</P>

      <P>We have allocated funding under the disabilities heading. It is earmarked funding <Col N="154" /> as far as I am concerned. Over &euro;40 million extra came to the Department from the Department of Finance in the budget. They were additional moneys, revenue and capital, which were subsequently allocated to the boards. It is not open to the boards to hold onto that money or to use it for other purposes. It must be used to make provision for people with intellectual disabilities and we have so advised the boards. In relation to other matters, we will be in discussion with the ERHA and the boards about the Dublin hospitals, etc. I will take up the issue the Deputy raised in respect of Step Enterprises and investigate it further.</P>
      <P>We have had quick hits financially in the health strategy in terms of primary care, extra beds, disability, care of the elderly and across the board.

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where will one get the best trained, best re-trained, best skilled and best re-skilled workers in the country? Where will one get the most committed employees with a work ethic second to none? Those of whom I speak are the labour pool in Inishowen, County Donegal. It was created over the years by the collapse of the textile industry and added to in the past week by the loss of yet another 18 jobs in Clubman Omega, Buncrana and the move to a three day week in that business. In extending my sympathy to those involved, I reiterate my condemnation of the lack of adequate response from the job creation agencies to this crisis. I demand answers.</P>
      <P>Where is the intervention for the existing textile industry to help with its markets? It was available for Moville Shirts but was it there for Clubman Omega? Is it there for Fruit of the Loom? Where is the intervention for the small number of non-textile factories that are currently hobbling along and not delivering the jobs complement they promised in their job announcements? Why do workers feel threatened with further job losses if they look for the agreed pay increases due to them in a number of the factories? Why are many employees falling between not getting enough hours to make part-time work credible or full-time work possible and, therefore, are constantly fighting a battle for their social welfare entitlements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where is the help to create jobs for the indigenous industries or to attract new companies? Why according to anecdotal evidence, given <Col N="155" /> our Objective One status, are we deemed by businesses who talk to IDA and Enterprise Ireland uncompetitive compared to other parts of the country and to the IDB? Why do people tell me that the State agencies are actively discouraging them from setting up in Inishowen and making the requirements impossible to attain? Is this true?</P>
    <P>This is the eve of the turning of the sod for enterprise units in my home town of Moville. The IDA spent almost seven years selling the land to Donegal County Council, despite many interventions by me at every level of the organisation under the current and previous chief executives and even, as a last resort, making representations to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. How many business ideas can wait seven years to get started? The IDA had the 11 acres and an advance factory in the town for 30 years and brought nothing to Moville. Locals, however, were able to create 100 jobs immediately, despite the IDA's efforts to delay this project, and in so doing put at risk the funding secured by the local community initiative. Shame on all those who were involved in blocking this project.</P>
    <P>Given this example of a project being stymied, what confidence can there be that this will not happen to the community development project in Carndonagh? How can one face towns such as Buncrana, which are reliant not on their own endeavours but on the enthusiasm of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to do their job, and tell them the IDA is busy marketing the empty factories that are omnipresent? How can we believe that our area is being considered when every day we hear good news of job creation throughout the country but none for us? I want assurances in relation to both Carndonagh and Buncrana.</P>
    <P>This Government has delivered to Inishowen. It has delivered Objective One status, the peace process, £7 million for access to Derry airport, and improvements to our basic infrastructure in terms of technology, ports and roads. The Government has not let us down. It is, therefore, galling to watch those in employment being exploited and females in the over 40 age bracket without employment being given no hope. The job creation agencies have much to answer for and I want those answers.</P>
    <P>For too long Donegal has played the peripheral card. It is not inaccessible. There is much talk about cross-Border co-operation between the IDA and the IDB but the people of Inishowen must see jobs delivered and the high hurdles currently put up against industries seeking to come to the area must be taken down. I demand accountability from the heads of the agencies who think we are not aware of and are not watching what is happening. We are aware and we will accept it no longer. It is time for action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for raising this matter <Col N="156" /> on the Adjournment. The loss of further jobs in the textile sector is to be regretted as, indeed, is the loss of jobs in any other sector. The textile sector, in particular, continues to see significant competitive pressure, forcing companies to respond to ensure that they can survive and be competitive.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is still considerable fallout from the US economic slowdown and the reason for the current job losses is that one of the company's biggest customers has cancelled its orders. This customer represented over 30% of the company's total business. The company has been working hard to develop new customers but in order to maintain the competitiveness of the total business it has had to make 18 people redundant and introduce a three day week for May, June and July, a traditionally quieter period. The redundancies are being made in Buncrana but the company's operation in Carndonagh will not be affected. The management of Clubman are confident of the long-term future of the company and that the remaining jobs are safe as long as current plans and activities continue to be successful. A full five-day week is expected to be restored in August.</P>
      <P>A county strategy for the future of County Donegal was launched this month. The County Development Board, through the establishment of a jobs executive forum, is continuing the work of the Donegal Employment Initiative Task Force, which was set up following the job losses in Fruit of the Loom and with which I was pleased to work and co-operate with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department and the State agencies.</P>
      <P>The focus is now on attracting higher value added companies compared to the traditional sectors such as agriculture and textiles. In this regard, Donegal has benefited from the attraction of Pacificare Health Systems, Prumerica, Intervention Technologies, Kirchhoff and the Cladagh Group. I was delighted to be involved, both internationally and nationally, with some of these decisions and in some of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>One of the problems Donegal has encountered over the years in trying to attract investment has been access to the county. I am pleased there are now public service order flights from Dublin to Donegal and Dublin to Derry. There has been significant recent investment in both Donegal airport and Derry airport. I commend Deputy Keaveney on the representations she has made and the success that resulted from her personal efforts in this regard. Road access is being tackled and almost &euro;160 million has been committed for national primary and secondary roads in Donegal up to 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecommunications is also a vital area, particularly looking to the future. Approval has been given to enhance the broadband capacity of County Donegal. Donegal County Council, with the assistance of ERNACT, made a submission to the Department of Public Enterprise to provide broadband services to Letterkenny, and 90% of <Col N="157" /> the funding has been approved. Funding was also approved for Údarás na Gaeltachta to develop broadband capacity in Gweedore, agus molaim na heachtairí sin freisin. In total, high speed Internet access is being given to 67 towns around the country, including, in Donegal, Letterkenny, Buncrana, Ballyshannon and Donegal town.</P>
    <P>As regards the site in Moville, the sale of Moville formed part of a larger transaction between IDA Ireland and Donegal County Council. Indeed, IDA Ireland and the county council have worked closely over a number of years in facilitating developments in Donegal which involved exchanges of land between the two of them. Certain legalities, at times, held up proceedings. However, I understand that negotiations in relation to Moville have only been completed within the past two years.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years IDA Ireland has radically changed its strategy with a view to achieving a better regional distribution of jobs. In this context, IDA Ireland strategies for Donegal have been tailored to meet the specific needs of the area. Its regional office was re-established in Letterkenny. Furthermore, IDA Ireland is in the process of relocating a number of key operating units into the north-west region with engineering and consumer products, with a section of international services relocating to Sligo. This is designed to stimulate and support growth from within the north-west region.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland and IDB in Northern Ireland have put in place a joint marketing programme for the north-west region, including Donegal and Derry. I am pleased with the co-operation of both of these organisations and their efforts North and South, particularly in the north-west region. I am confident that the strategies being pursued, not alone by IDA Ireland but also Enterprise Ireland, the County Development Board and the County Enterprise Board, will result in the creation of good and enduring employment for Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to Donegal has been constant and intense. Since the setting up of the Donegal task force, Donegal has seen a number of special initiatives and considerable investment in a range of areas from infrastructure to enterprise. I look forward to visiting Donegal tomorrow and to turning the sod for the business park in Moville. This latest initiative is a very good example of collaboration between the State development agencies and the local authority in the interests of jobs and local development.</P>
    <P>Again I congratulate the Deputy. I assure her and the people of Donegal that the Government and State agencies will leave no stone unturned to ensure that we maximise the opportunities for the skilled people of County Donegal, who have given great service over the years to the textile industry and other industries.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Motor Insurance Industry Report.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important topic. There are three <Col N="158" /> words to describe the implications of today's MIAB report for the Minister's approach to motor insurance and indeed insurance generally: negligence, negligence, negligence. The long-awaited MIAB report challenges virtually every conviction of the Minister as it relates to motor insurance. For the five years he has been in office, the Minister has procrastinated. His reign has been characterised by inaction and paralysis. The recommendation for the personal injuries tribunal to quickly and more cheaply process claims where liability is not contested, which was recommended by the McAuley group in 1997, has not been implemented. Most of all, the Minister has been negligent in respect of his duties, the exploitation of drivers, young and old, the need for reform of the legal system as it interacts with the insurance industry and in the area of competition enforcement. The Minister's negligence in all these areas has played to one gallery only, the vested interests which profit from and thrive as a result of that negligence.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also tried to hide information, suppress analysis and bury the interim work of the MIAB. The members of the MIAB, particularly the chairperson, deserve our thanks and congratulations for their perseverance and diligence in their research and for the clarity of their work.</P>
      <P>To crown his negligence, the Minister this morning had the audacity in his press release accompanying publication of the MIAB report to claim authorship of that report, having valiantly striven to keep it under wraps, delay it and pour cold water on the MIAB analysis, as evidenced in his comments on the interim report which was not published and only entered the public domain as a result of a freedom of information request. He unbelievably headlined the press release, Treacy's report to spearhead moves to tackle the high cost of motor insurance &ndash;&ldquo;Treacy's report&rdquo; no less, not the Dowling report or the MIAB report.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his press release, remarked on &ldquo;the credibility of the detailed analysis&rdquo;. That analysis appears little different in its thrust from the analysis contained in the MIAB interim report. The Minister's response to that analysis, when the report saw the light of day as a result of an FOI request, was to justify his concealment because &ldquo;there were serious deficiencies in the raw date.&rdquo; He went on to talk about &ldquo;flawed information&rdquo;, while at the same time making clear his conviction that the insurance industry would ultimately establish its case.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister talks of &ldquo;the credibility of the detailed analysis&rdquo; and observes that &ldquo;The Board . . . pulls no punches in contending that vested interests and inefficiencies may collectively account for as much as half the premium paid by law-abiding motorists.&rdquo; Where has the Minister been? What has he been doing in respect of these vested interests? He certainly has not been attending to the cause of exploited motorists, young and old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" />The level of exploitation and profiteering evident and described in the report is truly astounding. Vested interests and inefficiencies may account collectively for as much as half the premium paid by motorists &ndash; 50 cent in the euro of every premium ends up in the pockets of vested interests or wasted in inefficiencies.</P>
    <P>Profiteering on a vast scale is practised by insurers in relation to young female motorists. The insurers pocketed a profit of £300 per policy year from such policyholders for the period analysed by the advisory board. This compares with a profit of £16 per policy year for all policyholders over the age of 24. Young women account for almost half of all young insured drivers. This is a vast exploitation and most serious wrongdoing on the part of very large and very rich international corporations.</P>
    <P>We now discover that even young males, whom we have been told incessantly by the industry are hugely problematic, are not so problematic. Those aged 17 to 24 with full driving licences are profitable, generating a profit per policy year of £125 for the period analysed by the board. This group represents 24% of all young policyholders aged 17 to 24. This is a smaller percentage than young women but must reflect the problems these young people have in getting cover at all, never mind at a fair and equitable price. This is exploitation. The problem group is that of young male drivers on provisional licences. I hope we will discuss that category next week.</P>
    <P>In addition to the massive exploitation discovered by the MIAB, the board discovered &ndash; surprise, surprise &ndash; massive profit taking by insurance companies as a result. For the period analysed they are vastly more profitable &ndash; 11 times more so &ndash; than their counterparts in the UK, which Mike Kemp of the Insurance Industry Federation at lunchtime on RTE radio effectively described as an 11 year statistical quirk. It is some quirk.</P>
    <P>It is over a year since I wrote to the Equality Authority, on 29 March 2001, requesting that the Minister fund it to conduct an inquiry into allegations of discriminatory practices based on age or gender under the Equal Status Act. Only on receipt of today's report has the Minister finally referred the issue to the Equality Authority. Despite all the harrying by me and colleagues in this House, he still has not implemented the recommendation relating to the personal injuries tribunal, now called the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Meanwhile, young drivers have had confirmed for them today that they have indeed been ripped off by the insurance industry, but the Minister with responsibility for commerce has not implemented one reform in five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to be able to launch the report of the MIAB earlier today. At the launch, I paid tribute to the dedication of all the members of the board and its chairperson for <Col N="160" /> completing the report. They did not have an easy task, but they persisted in their efforts and have produced a report which is the most comprehensive study and analysis of the Irish motor insurance industry ever undertaken. While the report may have taken longer to finalise than was anticipated, I am convinced that the analysis now available to us was worth waiting for. I am glad that I extended the mandate of the board last year to allow it complete its analysis of the data. The board acted with great professionalism in obtaining information and assistance from its various members.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to 11 findings in the report. First, motor insurance premiums in Ireland comprise 1.6% of GDP. Second, litigation costs &ndash; legal and expert fees &ndash; add 40% to every &euro;1 paid in compensation for injury sustained in motor accidents. Third, motor insurers in Ireland reported 11 times the total post-tax profit earned by their UK counterparts between 1983 and 1999. Fourth, young male drivers aged 17 to 20 years on provisional licences produce very substantial insurance losses &ndash; they are involved in many accidents, resulting in the most serious of claims, at a frequency which is disproportionate to their representation as policyholders. Fifth, charges for young female policyholders are not justified by their claims costs and these policyholders have been described by insurers as &ldquo;subsidisers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sixth, the board has also registered particular concern about the position of senior citizens and those managing disabilities. Seventh, the consequences of uninsured driving are becoming more acute, with the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland estimating that they add 8% annually to the costs of claims in the aggregate motor insurance market. Eighth, not all claims ultimately involve outlay &ndash; for all types of insurance cover in the years 1997 to 1999, 29% of claims were finalised at zero outlay. Of the cases involving outlay, only 4% of accidents were valued at over £30,000 and 80% were valued below £5,000. Ninth, the market for private motor insurance is not competitive, a situation which is compounded by the fact that motor insurance is compulsory, thereby limiting the usual market forces dictated by consumers. The level of mergers has reduced some 17 separate motor insurers in 1993 to just five companies in 2001, some of which operate under various product images without their identity being apparent to consumers. Tenth, vested interests and inefficiencies may collectively account for as much as half the premium paid by the law-abiding motorist and, eleventh, a ground-breaking role is foreseen for the new Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; IFSRA &ndash; within which a statutory office of insurance ombudsman will be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also draw Members' attention to a document entitled Annotated Version of the Recommendations &ndash; of the MIAB &ndash; which is available from the Department. This document extracts the 67 recommendations from the report and, in the case <Col N="161" /> of each recommendation, indicates the issues which it addresses and those responsible for its implementation. We are now moving from the analysis stage to the implementation stage. On my recommendation, the Government has agreed to establish a high level implementation group to immediately progress the recommendations in the report. It will comprise representatives of various Government Departments, the Consumer Association of Ireland, IBEC, IFSRA and the chairperson of the MIAB.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an implementation group. I will give Deputy Flanagan an opportunity to speak on it next week. There will be no delay in preparing an action plan for implementation. The Government has mandated me to set up the high level group and this is already under way. The group will report back to Government within three months. It is clear, therefore, that the Government is very supportive of the broad thrust of the recommendations from the MIAB.</P>
      <P>I have also been mandated by the Government to refer the report to both the Competition Authority and the Equality Authority, which I have already done today to allow them take any necessary action on the report. In addition, we are extending the remit of the MIAB up to the end of this year so that it can monitor and report to us on progress on its recommendations.</P>
      <P>I stand over my record of appointing a motor insurance advisory board of 20 people, who have done an outstanding job, unlike my predecessor. I regard his utterances as the utmost hypocrisy. He sat in office before me and never once had a meeting with the MIAB, never took on any vested interest or took any action whatsoever. Now he sheds crocodile tears for the people of Ireland. Is it any wonder that the people are cynical when they listen to the utterances of a man who has fabricated in this House on many issues over many years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a short debate. This is very important Government business because the Government is, in essence, facilitating the closure of one of the most highly reputed secondary schools in the midlands, namely Patrician Col<Col N="162" /> lege, Ballyfin. The Minister for Education and Science met the parents' council representatives last December and promised to get back to them having studied a report they produced. I thought the Minister might have elaborated on his review tonight.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Education and Science stop this amalgamation immediately? The Department has decided to amalgamate two schools &ndash; what was the Patrician College, Ballyfin, with Portlaoise vocational school. It is an ill-founded and ill-conceived decision. It is a triumph for expediency over the public interest, namely the education of the children of the area. The decision is based on flawed assumptions in a report entitled the McCarthy report. There was no discussion, consultation or notice. Will the Minister indicate where the students who are now in Ballyfin College will go? What schools will they attend? In what part of County Laois will they receive their second level education?</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to call off this folly immediately. There are simply not sufficient places available in the amalgamated school programme the Minister has put forward as an alternative. It is a very serious issue. I want the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to convey the content of the contributions by me and my colleagues, Deputy Enright and Deputy Fleming, to the Minister in the morning with a view to stopping this ill-conceived amalgamation immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Education and Science is not in the House to hear this very important debate of an issue which affects the lives of many students in County Laois. The matter I put before the House is that Dáil Éireann is seriously concerned at the decision by the Minister for Education and Science to close Ballyfin College, Ballyfin, Portlaoise, County Laois, which is an excellent educational college with in excess of 500 pupils.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Education and Science to reverse this closure decision and confirm that it is intended that the college will remain open for future generations of students seeking second level education in County Laois. The decision by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government to close Ballyfin College is a major blunder. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, in their combined foolishness, arrived at the collective decision to close this school.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister of State to inform the Cabinet that the decision is wrong and I call on him to reverse it. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has decided to close this excellent facility and deprive students in County Laois of a top class educational establishment. I query the lack of common sense evident in the decision to close this school. Investment is needed in post-primary education in Portlaoise for the development of second level education in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister of State to make a special effort to keep the school open for future gener<Col N="163" /> ations. The closure of the school is like closing Trinity College, Dublin, University College Dublin or such schools across the country. Ballyfin College should remain open and I call on the Minister of State to make sure it is kept open for future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues, Deputies Flanagan and Enright, for raising the closure of the Patrician Brothers secondary school in Ballyfin. At this stage we must all look to the future, especially for the 535 students who attend the college. The Government has a legal, moral and constitutional obligation to provide classrooms and educational facilities for those 535 students. The only issue to be decided at this point is where the school should be located. Ballyfin College is located in a rural setting. It has been an outstanding success and the school should be retained in the Ballyfin area. The amalgamation with Laois VEC to form a new college in Portlaoise was carried out against the wishes of parents, teachers and everybody involved in education in Ballyfin. The Patrician Brothers are scaling back their involvement in education and are the least appropriate people to put forward proposals on an amalgamation with Laois VEC.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to listen to the parents, teachers, students, the people of Ballyfin and the people of County Laois. As a Fianna Fáil TD, I will do everything in my power to fight the decision to force this amalgamation on the people of Laois. This cause is right and just and I look forward to speaking directly with the Minister on this matter tomorrow morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position and the real facts regarding the proposed amalgamation of Ballyfin College and Portlaoise Vocational School into a community college under the aegis of County Laois Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to set out for the House the background to this development. Ballyfin College is a co-educational secondary school situated about six miles outside Portlaoise town. For the purpose of educational provision, Ballyfin is included in the Portlaoise post-primary school catchment area. There are three other post-primary schools in the catchment, all located in Portlaoise, namely, Scoil Críost Rí, an all-girls secondary school; St. Mary's CBS, an all-boys secondary school; and Portlaoise Vocational School, the only co-educational school under County Laois VEC.</P>
      <P>The majority of students who attend Ballyfin College are from the Portlaoise area. Of the 535 pupils currently enrolled in the college, about 300 are from that area. A substantial number of the remaining students come from primary schools in the adjoining Mountrath and Mountmellick catchment areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" />The trustees of the Patrician College indicated to the Department of Education and Science last year that they were not in a position to continue to provide post-primary education in Ballyfin. As an alternative, they proposed to phase out their involvement in post-primary education in Ballyfin and to participate instead in the management of an amalgamated community college with County Laois VEC. The trustees initiated this move. The Government did not have any hand, act or part in initiating it and it is ridiculous to blame the Government for this decision.</P>

        <b>: </b>Nuair a briseadh Tomás Ó Dúlaing as a phost mar phríomhoide ar Scoil Thulach na n-Óg i nDún Bóinne, déanadh seo toisc gur sheas sé i gcoinne leanaí a dheighilt ar bhun creidimh &ndash; sé sin ar bhun seicteach &ndash; le linn ceachta creidimh taobh istigh de ghnáth <Col N="166" /> am clár na scoile. Tá dualgas trom ar an Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta cur in aghaidh an chinnidh seo &ndash; príomhoide cróga, díograsach a bhriseadh as a phost. Glaoím ar an Aire a rá go dearfa go bhfuil sé in aghaidh an bhrisidh seo agus go gcuirfidh sé scéala chuig An Foras Patrúnachta nach glacfaidh sé leis, agus go gcuirfidh sé cumhacht oifige agus cumhacht na Roinne taobh thiar de seo.</P>
      <P>I am most displeased that the Minister for Education and Science is not here tonight to reply directly to this critical issue that has emerged in education. Today, Tomás Ó Dúlaing, the principal of the interdenominational gaelscoil in Dunboyne, County Meath, was sacked from his position by the school board of management. Tomás Ó Dúlaing's offence was to refuse to segregate little children during school hours on the basis of their religious denomination or, more correctly, the religious denomination of their parents.</P>
      <P>Last year, a policy decision was taken by the parents, all the teachers and the board of management that children of Protestant and Catholic families would have a common religious instruction on the doctrines on which the churches agree and that the minority doctrine on which disagreement existed would be taught outside school hours, thereby having a policy of avoiding the segregation of children during school hours on a religious basis. An Foras Patrúnachta, the patron body of gaelscoileanna, set out to overturn that policy and insisted on Protestant children effectively being sent out of the class or to be otherwise engaged while certain elements of doctrine were being taught.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that a society which has seen the fruits of sectarian education in Northern Ireland should, in 2002, see a policy of apartheid being introduced which children do not comprehended and which is not wanted by their parents. In a recent letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>, a parent stated that at recent parent meetings more than 75% of the school community have been in favour of the policy that had been in place and behind the principal, Tomás Ó Dúlaing. The letter went on to say that if An Foras Patrúnachta succeeds in its objectives, this parent's child, who is so far unaware of any significant difference between himself and his Protestant peers, will be forced to witness religious segregation on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>That raises the question of democratic control of education. The Catholic hierarchy should explain if it had a role in overturning the policy decision taken by the parents and the teachers last year and if it advised An Forus Patrúnachta to overturn this policy of opposition to segregation. If this is coming from the church, it should not be accepted, especially in a month when its care for other children in other circumstances was less than what was desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The INTO should vehemently oppose this position and all teachers' unions should take a stand. It raises the need for an education system that is democratically controlled but the most crucial question is whether the Minister for Education <Col N="167" /> and Science will stand up in favour of the policy of opposition to segregating children and, therefore, vehemently oppose the sacking of Tomás Ó Dúlaing.</P>
    <P>Tomás Ó Dúlaing is a highly competent, popular, principled and committed educator who is threatened with paying a heavy price for his stand against sectarian division of children in this State in 2002. He is a married man with a young family who is threatened with the loss of his job. He may not be employed by other patron bodies if this is confirmed. He must not be forced to pay such a price for his support for open and non-sectarian education. The Government has a serious responsibility to see to it that he is not called upon to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht an cás seo a ardú. Tuigeann sé go bhfuil sé casta, pearsanta, deacair agus go bhfuil réamhshamplaí dlíthiúla ann fosta nach rachaidh mé isteach iontu um thráthnóna. The Minister is aware of the controversy that has arisen at a school under the patronage of An Foras Patrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán Ghaeilge. Its ethos is described by the patron body as being of an inter-denominational character, whereby equal status is given to the Catholic and Church of Ireland religions. It is a matter for patron bodies to decide upon the ethos that will apply in individual schools and neither the Minister for Education and Science, any successive Minister, any of his predecessors nor his Department has or has had any wish to interfere in such matters. However, in order to establish whether his Department can assist in resolving this controversy the Minister's officials have been in contact with a number of parties, including the patron body, with a view to exploring whether a process of facilitation would be acceptable to all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, contact is ongoing between the Department and various parties. Under the circumstances the Minister proposes to await the outcome of these contacts before making any comments on the issue of facilitation. It is important to point out to the Deputy, however, that the disciplinary proceedings in which the principal teacher is involved are entirely matters for resolution between the board of management <Col N="168" /> of the school and the principal and not ones in which either the Minister or his Department can interfere. Primary schools are private institutions under independent management. The board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of the school and the employer of the teachers in the school, including the principal. The board is entitled to take disciplinary proceedings against him or her or any teacher if it considers that his or her conduct is or has been in some way unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is important, however, to balance this with the constitutional position. The principal is also entitled to be represented in any disciplinary process, which representation will normally be undertaken by the INTO. The secretary general of the INTO has already commented on this matter and is involved in trying to resolve it. Procedures have been agreed between the INTO and the representative bodies of boards of management about the format of any disciplinary proceedings. These procedures provide that a teacher must be informed of the complaints against him or her and be afforded the opportunity to respond to these complaints or allegations. In short, the disciplinary proceedings between the board and the principal are not matters in which the Department of Education and Science can interfere. Procedures are in place for dealing with such matters at local level. They do not provide for the involvement of the Department in any manner.</P>
    <P>The situation is a very sad one and I accept what Deputy Higgins has said. I do not know the principal involved but did go to a voluntary Catholic secondary school, a diocesan college of fairly reasonable repute which had, and still has, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, national and international students. Never in the history of that college, which spans most of the past century, has there been any difficulty in maintaining the religious ethos of the school and facilitating the other children in their religion through their parents and churches. I appeal to all sides in the case to stand back, be calm and reasonable and see if the matter can be resolved in a positive way as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 April 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I phoned Mr. Arafat on 29 April, during the holiday weekend, as a consequence of the sudden escalation of the problems in Israel and the Palestinian Autonomous Area. The deteriorating situation in the region had been a cause of concern for some weeks previous, but the events in progress on the day, including the latest suicide bombing, seemed to have brought the parties to the brink of open warfare. I was also naturally concerned for the personal well-being of Mr. Arafat and for the continuance in being of the Palestinian Authority. Both seemed at that time to be very much in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>In my conversation with Mr. Arafat, we discussed the events unfolding in the West Bank and specifically in his own compound. I emphasised the need for the utmost restraint on both sides and for the parties to respect the resolutions of the Security Council. I assured him of the commitment of Ireland to a peaceful resolution of the Palestinian issue and of our ongoing efforts both in the context of our membership of the Security Council and of the EU to achieve progress.</P>
      <P>The loss of life on both sides continues to mount and cannot be accepted. There is an ongoing and developing humanitarian crisis. The devastation of infrastructure in the Palestinian areas is enormous and will take years to reconstruct. The cost of the ongoing struggle in human life and general damage, largely borne by the civilian population on each side, can neither be justified nor tolerated.</P>
      <P>A reasonable and just settlement negotiated between the parties remains the only way to a secure and peaceful future for the region.<i>Questions Nos. 13 to 18, inclusive, resubmitted.</i></P>

      <Quest>his views on the findings of the report of the external advisory committee on the Defence Forces dealing with allegations of bullying and sexual harassment within the Defence Forces; if he accepts the recommendations of the report; if it is intended to implement the recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11768/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): In August 2001 the Chief of Staff established a special military steering group to examine these issues. I invited Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, to join the group as an expert civilian chairperson. Dr. Doyle was asked to determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area. She was joined by two other civilian experts and by senior military personnel.</P>
    <P>All serving female members of the PDF &ndash; some 453 women &ndash; were issued with a questionnaire, along with a large representative 10% sample of males. There was a high response rate of 54.5% overall. The results of the survey indicate that a significant number of respondents perceive themselves as experiencing quite unacceptable levels of harassment, bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment. Dr. Doyle and the joint civilian-military group have recently presented their completed report to me.</P>
    <P>I have fully accepted the report and its recommendations. The report notes that it will be essential that external civilian expertise be involved throughout the implementation process for the various recommendations. On the evidence of the research findings, there is a need for immediate action on a number of fronts. As an immediate initial step in implementing these recommendations, I have therefore established the independent monitoring group recommended in the report. The monitoring group will be chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle and will comprise the Deputy Chief of Staff &ndash; support &ndash; and an Assistant Secretary of my Department. The monitoring group will oversee, on my behalf, the drawing up and implementation of a plan to give effect to the fundamental reforms which the report has recommended. A separate military implementation group will be established by the Chief of Staff. In addition, an equality steering group, as recommended by the report will be established, and chaired by a member of the Labour Court. A consultative group will also be put in place. I know that we will have the active support and participation of the representative associations in this exercise. As an immediate measure, a confidential help line was made available to members of the Defence Forces from 5 April 2002.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report must now be comprehensively built into the general employee relations and human resources management system across and through all ranks and all services and corps of the Defence Forces. The report emphasises the need for continuous external review, including a further external survey in <Col N="171" /> Spring 2004, which will involve a thorough revisiting of all the aspects covered in the present report. That second review process in 2004 will also be undertaken for official publication. Dr. Doyle is being asked to convene an early meeting of the monitoring group to come forward with proposals on how best to proceed with implementation of the recommendations.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 33 and 40 together.</P>
    <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The sale of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council in conjunction with the IDA, for &euro;973,889, has been completed.</P>
    <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for &euro;380,921, all for local community purposes. I also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for &euro;8,888,167. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, the property has been sold to the North Eastern Health Board for &euro;761,843 and the legal formalities are now completed.</P>
    <P>The integrated action area plan, commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the former Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, has been adopted by Cork County Council. Lisneys have been appointed as selling agents and the property is being advertised <Col N="172" /> for sale by public tender this week. The closing date for receipt of tenders is 7 June 2002.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I also agreed to provide circa one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. Kildare County Council has recently requested that the term be extended and the matter is being examined in my Department at present. In relation to the remainder of this site I am arranging early discussions with all the interested parties including the local authority.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001. Two bids were received one of which was from Dublin City Council. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance. My Department is, of course, prepared to talk to any party interested in purchasing the property, which remains on the market and in this regard ongoing discussions are taking place with officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dublin City Council. It is my intention to generate the maximum return from the site for re-investment in essential Defence Forces needs. A portion of Clancy Barracks is currently being used to accommodate the homeless and a further area is being used for film making. Arising from this, some of the security costs for the barracks are being recouped from Dublin City Council and the film company. In this regard a sum of &euro;15,313 has been recouped to date.</P>
    <P>Arising from the temporary provision of accommodation for asylum seekers, the cost of security at Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now met by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As Castleblayney Military Barracks and the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, have been sold, no further costs fall to be met by my Department in relation to either of those properties.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure in relation to the former barracks since closure now stands at &euro;2,183,867. The total costs include expenditure on security, utilities, maintenance, advertising, etc.</P>
    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the six barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty alone, it is estimated that savings to date amount to &euro;1,513,359. In addition there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately &euro;243,218 in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed by the commanding officer of the Air Corps (details supplied) regarding pro posed incentive bonus payments to encourage pilots to stay within the Air Corps; the number of such offers made; and the amounts of money in question.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11771/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): The service commitment scheme was introduced in 1997 for pilot officers of the Air Corps. From the outset the scheme applied primarily to experienced personnel who were currently rated on and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA and Dauphin aircraft which are the principal operational aircraft in the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The scheme was introduced with a view to assisting in the retention in service of experienced operational pilots in key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport.</P>
    <P>The gratuities available under the scheme were designed to strike a fair and reasonable balance between the demands of the external commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay. Such financial incentives are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining highly qualified and readily marketable personnel. The scheme, moreover, was perceived to offer a more acceptable avenue of approach for all concerned than the imposition of any compulsory retention.</P>
    <P>The scheme was originally offered to selected personnel over a two year period from August 1997 to July 1999, inclusive. I am satisfied that, as a significant and innovative incentive scheme, it has helped both to stabilise the loss of key pilots from the Air Corps and to create an environment of some predictable manpower certainty for the medium term future in that regard. A total of 18 pilots had opted to participate under the terms of the scheme at the end of the original two year period of sanction. Application for entry to the scheme was, of course, entirely voluntary in nature.</P>
    <P>In August 2000 the terms of the scheme were made available to a small additional number of pilots who had by then become eligible to participate and voluntary renewal of commitments was also offered to those pilots whose original period of commitment under the scheme had expired. Three pilots have entered into or renewed service commitments under this phase of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in August 2001 the terms of the scheme were made available to a small additional number of pilots. To date four pilots have entered into or renewed service commitments under this phase of the scheme. Since the scheme was introduced in 1997 a total of 42 offers have been made to eligible pilots. Twenty-two of these pilots have voluntarily entered into the scheme. The cost of the scheme to date is &euro;1,155,461.58 which includes &euro;72,288.10 to be paid at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a new format of service commitment scheme are under active consideration by the military authorities.</P>

      <QRef>[12043/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 44 and 121 together.</P>
    <P>At the informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers at Saragossa in Spain on 22 March 2002, I attended discussions which focused on the achievement of European capabilities for crisis management. Other issues which were discussed related to the institutional development and the future of ESDP, a possible European Union lead role in relation to the international force in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, for the protection of international observers there. Issues relating to the Mediterranean dimension of ESDP, international humanitarian law and public opinion were also considered.</P>
    <P>There are generally one or two such meetings for Defence Ministers held during the course of each EU Presidency. As the meetings are informal, no decisions are reached and the main purpose of the meetings is to provide an opportunity for Ministers to discuss progress made in relation to the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, and in particular the Helsinki Headline Goal.</P>
    <P>At the meeting, I emphasised Ireland's continuing commitment to participating in the ESDP and in particular to contributing our highly experienced and professional Defence Forces to Petersberg Task operations authorised by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The question of EU involvement in a Petersberg type operation in FYROM was raised at the EU summit held in Barcelona on 15 and 16 March 2002. At the summit, the EU Council requested that the relevant political and military bodies of the Council develop the options to enable the EU to take the appropriate decisions in relation to taking responsibility for the mission currently undertaken by NATO. In this context the EU Council has expressed the European Union's availability to take responsibility, following elections in FYROM &ndash; which are likely to <Col N="175" /> take place in September 2002 &ndash; and at the request of the FYROM government on the understanding that the permanent arrangements on EU-NATO co-operation, would be in place by then.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of Security Council Resolution 1371, the United Nations &ldquo;strongly supports&rdquo; the efforts of the international community, including the OSCE, the EU and NATO in co-operation with the FYROM government, in their efforts to contribute to peace and stability in the region. The current NATO mission in FYROM is a mission which is deployed in order to provide security for international observers from both the EU and the OSCE, including representatives from Ireland, who are in FYROM to assist in the process of consolidating a peaceful multi-ethnic society in a country which has had very recent experience of conflict.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Deputies may recall that at the Laeken European Council in December 2001 the EU adopted a declaration on the operational capability of the European Security and Defence Policy. The proposal to take responsibility for the operation in FYROM, which as I mentioned above, has the strong support of the United Nations, would give tangible effect to this declaration.</P>
    <P>Discussions are ongoing under the Spanish Presidency in relation to the financing of future EU missions. Ireland favours maximising a system whereby costs lie where they fall, that is, that participating countries will pay for the costs incurred by their contingents to particular missions. This is the method by which both KFOR and SFOR, in which Ireland participates, are funded. However, it is likely that in such a system, Ireland would also have to contribute to some costs which cannot be readily ascribed in this way.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to stress again to the House, as I have on many occasions in the past, that the European Security and Defence Policy is an effort by the European Union to establish a capability of carrying out humanitarian, peace support and crisis management operations &ndash; known as Petersberg Tasks. It is not a European army.</P>
    <P>National sovereignty is an underlying principle to participation in the ESDP and Ireland will only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. The decisions on participation taken by individual member states will subsequently be confirmed through the framework of the EU Council.</P>
    <P>Our Defence Forces have accumulated considerable expertise with the United Nations over the years and their contribution to missions designed to promote peace and stability are illustrative of the generous humanitarian values that underpin Ireland's approach to assisting those who have suffered the traumatic con<Col N="176" /> sequences of strife or conflict. Ireland therefore has a very positive role to play in contributing this expertise to the efforts of the EU to promote peace and stability.</P>

    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): Tenders for the upgrade of runways and taxiways at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, are due for return on 24 April 2002.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the contract will be placed in late May 2002, with a target completion date towards the end of this year. There will be minimal disruption to the ministerial air transport service while work is in progress.</P>

      <QRef>[11776/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): Baldonnel Aerodrome is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel as outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present for other developments at the aerodrome. I will, however, keep the matter under review to determine whether greater use might be made of this important resource.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware the position of Baldonnel was considered in the Warburg Dillon Read-AIB report, 1999, which assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin on behalf of the Department of Public Enterprise and they saw no reason to hinder commercial development at the aerodrome subject to appropriate planning approvals. The needs of the Air Corps will continue to be of primary importance.</P>
    <P>Before any consideration can be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel it will be necessary to bring Baldonnel Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. This is a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>

    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): On the night of 27 November 2001, a progression course from two to three star private ranking was under way in the Glen of Imaal. A number of personnel were instructed to fire blank ammunition during the course of the exercise. During the exercise a number of live rounds of ammunition were accidentally discharged. The injured private received bullets wounds to his arm and chest. A military ambulance was on site and the injured party was immediately treated by a qualified emergency medical technician. The injured private was then transferred to Tallaght Hospital and subsequently to St. James's Hospital where he underwent treatment. The injured private is still under medical care.</P>
    <P>Military police were immediately called to the scene and are currently finalising their investigation into the incident. They hope to be in a position to submit their report to the military authorities shortly. Pending the final outcome of the investigation, arrangements have been put in place to ensure that a recurrence of the events of the 27 of November does not take place.</P>

    <P>To augment the ministerial transport service, the lease for one year of a seven to eight seater jet aircraft to act as a back-up to the Gulfstream IV is at present under consideration by my Department. This additional aircraft would service destinations in Ireland and western Europe.</P>

      <QRef>[11858/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): On 17 January 2002, I authorised my Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations, Inc., Connecticut, USA, for the purchase of three medium range helicopters &ndash; S-92s &ndash; for search and rescue purposes. The negotiations were also to include an option exercisable within three years by the Department for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
    <P>The decision followed from a detailed examination of the original tenders received from the four companies &ndash; Sikorsky, USA; CHC Scotia, Scotland; EH Industries Limited, UK, and Eurocopter, France and an examination of the best and final prices submitted by the four companies in December 2001.</P>
    <P>In this regard I should say that I decided to seek best and final prices from each of the four tenderers because of the expiration of the validity of all the tenders and taking into account the changed international situation after the terrible events of 11 September. Following the submission and examination of the best and final prices, I deemed that the offer from Sikorsky was the most strategically and economically advantageous tender taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition, which were: functional characteristics; technical merit; all maintenance and on-line technical support; after sales service and warranty terms on offer; cost and ready availability of spare parts; tender prices and life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, on the basis of the facts presented to me, that the offer from Sikorsky would provide best value for money from the taxpayers point of view. The timeframe proposed by Sikorsky would see the delivery of three search and rescue helicopters by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Following on from my decision of 17 January 2002, Eurocopter have now instituted judicial <Col N="179" /> review proceedings contesting the decision to open negotiations with Sikorsky. The matter was up for mention in the High Court last Monday, 15 April 2002. The matter was adjourned by consent of all parties to Monday, 13 May 2002 for mention.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to deal with the Chief State Solicitor's office on the judicial review proceedings. It is my intention to be as forthcoming as possible in this regard. However, as the matter is due to come before the courts again in mid-May I do not wish to say anything further at this stage.</P>

      <QRef>[11788/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): The table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report <Col N="180" /> indicates the number of female personnel within the Permanent Defence Force as at 28 February 2002. These figures provide a breakdown between officers and various non-commissioned ranks across each of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
    <P>In previous years the trend for general service recruitment has been that 10% of all applicants have been female and that on average 10% of enlistments have been female. It is obviously not possible to predict what the relevant percentages will be in any future intakes of recruits, but there is no reason to assume that this pattern will change to any great degree.</P>
    <P>Some 19.4% of applicants for the 2001 cadetship competition were female of which 18.3% were successful.</P>
    <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5 4 and this height requirement now also applies to male recruits.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 48 together.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the current recruitment campaign a total of 2,588 applications have been received for positions in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Of this total figure, 1,316 are applications for general service recruitment, that is, as enlisted personnel in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. This pool together with any further such applications received will be used during the year to fill general service vacancies as they arise. A further 1,098 applications have been received for <Col N="181" /> inclusion in the cadetship competition from which up to 70 cadets will be recruited. In addition, 174 applications have also been received for various direct entry competitions for specialist appointments as officer or enlisted personnel in the Permanent Defence Force. As of now there are 116 general service recruits in training across the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 28 February 2002, the most recent date for which details are available, was 10,592 with a further 459 in the First Line Reserve and 13,017 in the Second Line Reserve Force.</P>
    <P>The February 2000 White Paper on Defence sets out a total strength figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps; 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. In addition, the White Paper provides for up to 250 recruits in training at any one time. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to fill vacancies as required.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the provision of night flying training for Air Corps pilots servicing the Garda air support unit; the discussions he had with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11783/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): On 23 April 1996 the Government approved the establishment of a dedicated Garda air support unit, GASU, as recommended in the report of the interdepartmental group on air support for the Garda Síochána. The service provided through the Garda air support unit which was inaugurated in September 1997 comprises Garda Síochána and Air Corps personnel and operates from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. The Garda Síochána is responsible for the operational control and policing functions, while the Air Corps personnel have responsibility for the flying and maintenance functions of the service. Two aircraft are operated by the Air Corps on behalf of the Garda Síochána, one twin engine AS355N Squirrel Helicopter and one Defender 4000 fixed wing aircraft. On 10 November 1998 the Government approved the acquisition of a second twin engine helicopter with a 24 hour capability for the GASU. This new helicopter, an EC 135, is due for delivery in the very near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of night flying training for Air Corps pilots, on 12 May 1999, during an operation in the Clare-Galway region, the Garda air support unit helicopter inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a number of recommendations, one of which was that the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by Air Corps GASU pilots. This recommendation was implemented.</P>
    <P>To facilitate an effective programme of training which would not impinge on the ongoing GASU operation, I announced, in February 2000, that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of the GASU. Work began in the Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on 22 May 2000, a request for tender for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355F2 helicopter to the Department of Defence issued.</P>
    <P>The AS 355F2 helicopter was manufactured by Eurocopter in France between 1988 and 1995. As the Department ideally required a helicopter which would be backed up by the manufacturer from the point of view of warranties, maintenance and support, the tender documentation issued <Col N="183" /> only to Eurocopter through their Irish agent, Atron based in Sandyford, Dublin 18. However, Eurocopter was not able to offer a suitable AS 355F2 helicopter which they could guarantee and support. Efforts to acquire on the open market a used AS 355N helicopter, a later model of the F2 also manufactured by Eurocopter were also not successful.</P>
    <P>This matter is the subject of ongoing communication between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the call made by the commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Lebanon for the return of a small group of Irish soldiers to help cope with violence in the area; if he has received a formal request from the UN for personnel; his views on such a request; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): As the House will be aware the 89th Infantry Battalion, the last Irish Battalion to serve with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, completed its service with the force in November 2001. In the meantime 11 members of the Defence Forces &ndash; ten officers and one NCO &ndash; have continued to serve with the force in its headquarters at Naqoura, Lebanon, and are due to complete their tours of duty early next month.</P>
    <P>However, on foot of a request by the UNIFIL Force Commander to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, United Nations Headquarters to maintain a small cadre of Irish officers in UNIFIL, a formal request was received in my Department on 4 April 2002, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, for the provision of eight Defence Forces personnel &ndash; five officers and three NCOs &ndash; to fill appointments at UNIFIL HQ from May 2002 onwards. Some of the appointments offered to Ireland are new and will be part of the new UNIFIL HQ structure.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I have agreed to the UN request and the Department of Foreign Affairs is informing the UN accordingly. Two of the appointments in question are currently held by Irish personnel viz. senior liaison officer and aide de camp to the force commander. The UN proposals entail the retention of these two officers in their appointments for a further six months from May 2002. The other six personnel will take up their appointments with UNIFIL between May and October 2002.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date regarding the acquis ition of new Piranha armoured personnel carriers for the Defence Forces; the number delivered to date; the number in respect of which cracks have been discovered in the hulls; when the balance is expected to be delivered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11786/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): A contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers, initial spares, special tools and training courses. The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, included 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of &euro;50.8 million, including VAT. The full production run on the APCs is now complete and all 40 APCs have been delivered to the Curragh camp.</P>
    <P>Training of Defence Force personnel on the APCs has been continuing apace and the first overseas deployment of the APCs has taken place with the dispatch of five APCs to Eritrea for service with UNMEE. A further APC is due to be dispatched for service in Eritrea in the near future. I am advised by the military authorities that the APCs are performing exceptionally well in the mission area.</P>
    <P>Last August the appearance of cracks in the hulls of three APCs was noticed in the Curragh Camp. The issue was dealt with as a warranty item under the guarantee given by Mowag under the contract. Detailed discussions took place between Mowag and the Department on the cracks and expert investigations were put in train to determine their exact cause. I am advised that these cracks are not entirely unusual because of the type of manufacturing process involved in the production of the steel hulls of the APCs.</P>
    <P>As a result of the investigations, a range of remedial actions have been taken to deal with the issues raised as a result of the appearance of the cracks and the cracks on the three APCs were repaired. Since then cracks, some of a minor nature, have appeared in the hulls of six other APCs and again they have been dealt with as a warranty item. Firing tests have shown that the repairs to the hulls will not affect the integrity of the ballistic protection afforded by the APCs. The military authorities are happy with the method of repair of the APCs in question. An extension in the warranty from one to five years has been agreed with Mowag to cover the Department against the possibility of the appearance of cracks in any of the 40 APCs supplied under the contract.</P>
    <P>The current contract contains an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs. This option is exercisable until January 2003. Discussions took place with representatives from Mowag in the latter months of 2001 on the option clause. However, because of the appearance of cracks, it was considered prudent to leave any uptake of the option for the present time. The matter will <Col N="185" /> be revisited later this year when the current APCs have been operational for a period of time.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the number of officers in the rank of lieutenant and captain that left the Defence Forces between 1997 and 2001, inclusive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11708/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith): One hundred and eighty captains and ten lieutenants retired or resigned from the Permanent Defence Force between 1997 and 2001 inclusive. Commissioned officers may leave the Defence Forces by voluntary retirement or resignation of their commissions.</P>
    <P>As one might reasonably expect, members of the Permanent Defence Force, across all ranks, take up offers of civilian employment in times of economic prosperity. While this trend would also apply to some extent to certain other categories of public sector employees, there are two quite distinctive factors which specifically impinge upon the general PDF situation.</P>
    <P>The PDF pension schemes are among the most generous within the public service. In the case of commissioned officers, a pension is payable immediately, along with a lump sum after the completion of only 12 years military service. For example, an officer, such as an army captain, may retire from the PDF in his or her late 30s and immediately receive a military pension for life along with a retirement lump sum. While exact amounts would of course vary by rank and service in individual cases, typical cases at captain level could attract a pension of about &euro;14,000, £11,000, per annum for life, linked to future movements in captain's pay, and a tax-free gratuity of about &euro;28,000, £22,000.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised, not least by private sector employers, that the programmes of personal development and training available in the Defence Forces are second to none and can stand comparison with the best in the private sector. Nowadays, military skills training encompasses a very broad range of well recognised courses of training in highly marketable specialisms such as computer software and information technology. Many military personnel, in all ranks, are increasingly educated to diploma, degree and indeed to post graduate degree level in such readily marketable specialisms. Obviously, such personnel, already pre-trained and well experienced to the highest levels, are a tempting target to the private sector. In addition, the unique leadership and management skills of military officers has made them a very attractive target for managerial recruitment.</P>
    <P>The majority of officer retirements are currently voluntary in so far as they are not com<Col N="186" /> pulsorily determined by the reaching of a prescribed maximum retirement age by the incumbent. Relatively few officers would stay in the PDF for the maximum period possible, that is, to their prescribed retirement age in rank and nor would this be desirable. The positive features of turnover within officer ranks, and the consequential flow of promotions for younger officers, must be actively borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the prestigious annual cadetship competition continues to draw an applicant pool of well educated and academically talented school leavers. There are 1,098 individual applicants for the 2002 cadetship competition, which will result in the award of 70 cadetships.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the Defence Forces to retain highly trained and experienced young officers. The loss of young officers is attributable to numerous contributory factors. Two aspects that immediately come to mind are the perceived lack of opportunity for more rapid career advancement for the most talented and able young officers and, as I have already mentioned, the very attractive lump sum and pension arrangements available for departing officers. Of course, in recent years, there have been great opportunities in the burgeoning private sector for such well qualified and highly motivated personnel.</P>
    <P>I remain convinced that the Gleeson Commission's recommendation that a mechanism be developed under which officers of exceptional ability might expect to reach the rank of lieutenant colonel, while still in their thirties, would help to reduce the loss to the private sector of at least some of the most experienced officers with skills that are in demand.</P>
    <P>In this regard, a merit-based promotion scheme that will enable the best and brightest young officers to progress swiftly up the ranks is necessary, and it is my sincere hope that RACO will work with the official side to devise a scheme that meets this objective. The planned review of the 1997 promotion agreement will provide an opportunity to address these issues.</P>
    <P>As set out in the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that an updated Integrated Defence Forces personnel management plan would be prepared by military management as a matter of priority. This plan will set down policies and goals to ensure that personnel policies and practices keep pace with the current best practice to the benefit of the Defence Forces. The integrated personnel management plan will establish a comprehensive intake policy and active personnel management framework to address the Defence Forces officer requirements in the coming decade.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the shortage of junior officers in the Defence Forces is causing some difficulties. I believe that this matter requires a <Col N="187" /> creative, dynamic and innovative response. Among the initiatives that must be examined in this context are graduate recruitment, short service commissions and a much more active programme of commissioning from the ranks.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Millennium Office has commissioned a book that will provide a permanent record of the millennium celebrations. It is <Col N="190" /> intended that the book would recognise the enormous voluntary effort put in by people and organisations throughout the country in marking the millennium in appropriate and lasting ways. Contributions were received from many people who contributed to the celebrations. The national millennium committee is grateful for the contributions received from so many organisations and individuals.</P>
      <P>Following a competitive tender, in November 2000, the Millennium Office commissioned an experienced firm, PC Associates, to design, manage, print and distribute the book. The budget was set at £70,000, &euro;88,900. The contract was awarded based on a detailed quote from the company. The lowest tender was selected. As the project progressed, it became clear that the final product would be far more extensive than had been originally thought. For example, the initial estimate had been for a publication of 160 pages, but this has now risen to 280 pages. The increase in size is due to the volume of material provided for inclusion by individual project promoters, both locally and nationally.</P>
      <P>In light of the increased size of the publication, there has been a corresponding increase in costs and delays in progressing the project. In order to speed up the completion process, the millennium press office, in February, took control of the final phase of the project in consultation with the designers. To date, payments totalling £72,152, &euro;91,633, have been made to PC Associates. Payment has been made in six instalments between January 2001 and December 2001. In addition the millennium press office incurred additional costs of £945, &euro;1,200, chiefly in respect of photographic expenses.</P>
      <P>Final proofs are expected to be available this week and it is hoped that the book will be published shortly. Tenders have been sought from five printing companies for the printing of the book and four replies are currently being evaluated. It is not possible to state what the final costs for the printing will be, or the date for publication, as this is dependent upon negotiations with the tendering companies and costs are dependent upon time factors.</P>

      <P>When community employment, CE, was introduced in 1994, arrangements were put in place with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities whereby there would be no increase in the differential rents of tenants in local authority housing due to the increase in income while participating on CE. I am not aware that the current arrangements act as a disincentive for unemployed persons who are local authority tenants to participate in CE.</P>
      <P>As provided for under the PPF, an overall review of active labour market programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the near future under the aegis of the PPF standing committee on the labour market. The future policy direction of CE will be informed by the outcome of this process, including the elimination of any remaining disincentives to employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The local employment service was established in 1995 to engage with those most distant from the labour market. Currently, there are 26 local employment service networks operating nationally, two of which, Clare and Kildare, are in non-partnership areas. The number of partnership companies is 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" />The impact of the fast changing environment means that there will be a need for focus on those experiencing real difficulties accessing jobs in the open labour market. I am committed to ensuring that this focus continues and that the combined resources of both the local employment service and FÁS employment services are managed in such a way that the two strands of the new national employment service are complementary in helping those experiencing the most difficulty.</P>
    <P>In December last year, I launched the FÁS statement of strategy 2002-2005 which clearly sets out in one of its priority goals, the need to stem the flow into long-term unemployment, through the provision of a range of programmes and services for unemployed people, with a particular focus on marginalised groups. Since 2001 a funding and operational framework agreement exists between FÁS and 24 partnership companies for the delivery of a local employment service.</P>
    <P>In the overall context of the FÁS strategic review of policy, and the key role filled by the national employment service in meeting labour market policies and objectives, I have requested the FÁS board to undertake a review of the activities and resources of the national employment service to ensure that it is fully and properly equipped to carry out its essential tasks. This review will be carried out under the aegis of the employment service advisory committee on which my Department is represented at senior level.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the outcome of this review will inform future decisions on whether there should be further expansion of the local employment services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the ongoing restructuring of community employment and the mainstreaming of CE schools services which is currently being implemented, a number of projects are discontinuing and, therefore, it is not possible to retain the current levels of supervisors on the programme. Supervisors becoming redundant are entitled to statutory redundancy in accordance with the terms of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, and to minimum notice under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, as amended by the Worker Protection Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS employment services will make every effort to ensure that supervisors are made aware of other employment opportunities, including <Col N="193" /> those arising in the social economy, as this programme is rolled out, or in other CE projects. FÁS employment service will initiate contact with such supervisors and provide the full range of employment supports, including job placement or further training if required. In addition, FÁS will ensure that redundant supervisors, with their consent, are placed on the regional database of community employment supervisors for future prospective employers. Discussions on mainstreaming in other sectors are not yet completed.</P>

      <P>The employment of supervisors, or otherwise, in schools is not a specific requirement under the 1989 Act.

      <P>Company law has been drafted in a way which seeks to both protect the interests of minority investors and which also encourages economic activity.</P>
      <P>Section 8(3) of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997 requires the panel to make rules to provide that where a person or persons acting in concert acquire effective control of a company, that is, where they control not less than 30% of the company's voting rights, the person or persons in control are required to make an offer for all of the remaining shares of the company. The purpose of this is to protect minority shareholders so that they do not get locked into holding shares in a company, the effective control of which is exercised by another party.</P>
      <P>Under section 204 of the Companies Act, 1963, a company that receives acceptance of an offer to acquire 80% of another company's share capital is empowered to acquire the shares of the remaining shareholders of that company. There is an option for such minority shareholders to make an appeal to the courts against any such mandatory acquisition of shares. The rationale behind this compulsory acquisition provision is that it is often not an attractive proposition for a purchasing company to acquire less than 100% of the share capital of another company and acquisition schemes that are economically desirable might not proceed if this provision did not exist.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 204 of the Companies Act, 1963, and the question of minority rights in a takeover were considered by the Company Law Review Group. The review group is a statutory body comprising a wide range of interested parties established to consider issues relating to the updating and amendment of the Companies Acts. The review group, in its first report published earlier this year, recommended that the 80% threshold for triggering compulsory acquisition should remain.</P>
      <P>Having regard to all of these factors I do not propose to amend the provisions of the Companies Acts in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>

I am informed that these applications had been received at an earlier date but were rejected following a pre-check. Applications which are incorrectly completed or which do not have the necessary documentation from FÁS, as well as appropriate fees, photographs etc. are not regarded as valid applications and are returned to the employer for completion. It is the policy of the Department to process all valid applications for work permits strictly in the order in which they are received. Applications received on the date in question are been processed within six weeks of receipt.</P>
      <P>The processing time for work permits is directly related to the number of work permit applications received and has recently been reduced from a high of ten weeks recently. In addition, the backlog of almost 7,000 work permit applications on hand and awaiting decision at the end of December 2001 have now been reduced to under 2,000 applications. To date, some 11,000 work permits have issued this year.</P>

      <P>The new guidelines for the future operation of community employment were introduced in August 2001, and were effective from that date. FÁS now has discretion to extend, on a case by case basis, an individual's term on CE, having regard to that individual's personal development needs and future employment prospects.</P>
      <P>Participants are considered for an extension under the new arrangements if on reaching the end of their normal entitlements on CE they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment. A number of CE participants have difficulty in progressing to open labour market employment due to their age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally. For such participants FÁS now has discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis. In general, approximately 20% of participants on CE may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the new flexibility guidelines.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including the health and environmental sectors, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme.</P>
      <P>There were 30,809 participants on CE at the beginning of 2002 and I anticipate a year-end participation rate in the region of 24,000. In excess of &euro;355 million was spent on CE by FÁS during 2001 and the proposed budget for 2002 is &euro;333 million. During this period over &euro;40 million has been transferred from the FÁS budget to the Department of Education and Science to replace CE services in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As provided for under the PPF, an overall review of active labour market programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the near future under the aegis of the PPF standing com<Col N="200" /> mittee on the labour market. The future policy direction of CE will be informed by the outcome of this process.</P>

      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents me and our Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of the risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases, including the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the affects of the September 11 attacks in the United States.</P>
      <P>Representations being made to me suggest that many businesses seek insurance cover from sources outside Ireland. Availability from these sources has contracted, as capacity in the international market has been impaired following the events of September 11 last.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by businesses in getting cover, even at very high premiums. I recently met the Irish Insurance Federation and representatives of the main insurers here to discuss these difficulties. The issue of firms with good safety records, and insured with a particular undertaking for an extended length of time, getting insurance renewals without significant premium increases was raised at the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" />Meanwhile, I await the report of the interdepartmental implementation group set up to progress the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board &ndash; PIAB &ndash; so that the board may be set up as quickly as possible. The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board has included an examination of the cost of motor insurance. I am giving urgent consideration to the best way of advancing the MIAB's recommendations. Further work to improve health and safety standards in the workplace is also in progress.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited is a UK authorised insurer currently in provisional liquidation. The liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law.</P>
      <P>My first concern on learning that IICL had gone into provisional liquidation in June of last year was to ensure that IICL's policyholders in Ireland could get alternative cover. I met representatives of Irish insurers to underline the importance of alternative cover being made available to them. I understand that most Irish policyholders found alternative cover, although many have had to pay a much higher price.</P>
      <P>The 2% levy referred to was introduced by the Government back in 1984 to finance the insurance compensation fund following the collapse of PMPA in 1983. The fund is administered by the High Court, and can only be used in the event of a liquidation carried out by the Irish High Court in respect of an Irish authorised general insurer. The current levy, which at present applies to insurance policies, is a general stamp duty, the proceeds of which go to the Exchequer and not to the Insurance Compensation Fund.</P>

      <P>While employers' liability and public liability insurances are not compulsory in Ireland, surveys carried out indicate that approximately 90% of companies were covered either by commercial or self-insurance.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a statutory requirement for limited liability companies to have certain minimum levels of insurance cover in place, while trading would be a radical departure from existing practice.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche management consultants' report on insurance costs in Ireland, 1996, pointed out a number of possible disadvantages to having compulsory employers' liability insurance: distortion of the market; special arrangements being needed to insure bad risks, as in the case of motor insurance, possibly increasing premiums overall; companies that currently do not have insurance are unlikely to have the highest safety standards; difficulties with restrictions on market capacity and possible negative effect on safety in the workplace.</P>
      <P>There is also the possibility that general insurers in other EU member states might be discouraged from writing business in the Irish market if liability insurance cover were compulsory, since they would have to participate in arrangements designed to ensure that all risks could receive a quote. They would also have to contribute towards an uninsured employers fund.</P>
      <P>While I accept that there are also possible advantages to having compulsory employers' liability insurance, I believe that any such proposal would need very careful consideration and would involve detailed consultation with the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formal notice related to the excess power in the pelagic segment of the Irish fishing fleet. The present position is that the excess power sit<Col N="218" /> uation has been substantially addressed and the residual excess is now being resolved.</P>
    <P>The deletion of the fishing vessel MFV <i>Veronica</i> from the fishing boat register has permanently removed 5,850 KWs from the pelagic segment. This represents a significant contribution by the Atlantic Dawn company to resolving the outstanding power overcapacity in the Irish pelagic segment. The vessel was permanently withdrawn from the Irish-EU fleet as part of an overall agreement which enabled the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> vessel to be fully licensed and registered on the Irish and EU fishing boat registers. The Commission's agreement to adjust Ireland's pelagic fleet objectives to facilitate the introduction of the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> was subject to resolution of the overcapacity problem in the pelagic segment. The retention by the Atlantic Dawn company of its annual quota and effort entitlement in EU waters as part of the overall agreement with the company is not directly relevant to the power overcapacity issue.</P>
    <P>Those pelagic vessels with excess engine capacity have been required to resolve the excess and resolution is expected to be achieved shortly. The EU Commission will progress a further technical decision removing the balance of the excess capacity because the pelagic fleet is operating an effort reduction regime. Similar decisions have been processed for other member states. The pelagic segment will be within its power objective as soon as both of these actions are finalised.</P>

This report is being evaluated by my Department.</P>
      <P>Consideration of any subsequent proposal for the development of the harbour by the local authority will be informed by the findings of the cost benefit analysis.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Since the previous reply to these questions, which was provided on 26 March 2002, the report of the Ireland Aid review committee has been endorsed by the Government and published. The review report, which makes recommendations on the entire Ireland Aid programme, includes proposals regarding the future role and structure of APSO.</P>
      <P>The review report recognises the very valuable work carried out by APSO over a generation and the fact that it has been the vehicle by which thousands of Irish people have been able to serve in developing countries.</P>
      <P>The review report fully recognises, as APSO has done, that fundamental questions have arisen concerning the role, functioning and future of the organisation in a situation in which development aid practice has been changing radically and the emphasis is now on building local capacity rather than employing expatriate volunteers. In this regard, the review committee has recommended that over time and on a planned and phased basis, APSO will be integrated into Ireland Aid. In this way, APSO's experience will be built upon and greater synergies attained, while its role and values are safeguarded.</P>
      <P>The agency is perceived as having a particularly special role in working very closely with missionary organisations. It is intended that APSO will support missionaries both through the co-financing and training of personnel and through the administration of expanded programme funds. APSO will thus provide the missionaries with both financial assistance and strategic guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report to which the Deputy refers, which was commissioned by the board of APSO, contributed to the comprehensive deliberations of <Col N="222" /> the Ireland Aid review committee. As the board of APSO, in close co-ordination with Ireland Aid, considers how best to implement the relevant recommendations of the review report, this process will be informed by the very considerable review and evaluation work undertaken by the APSO board over the past number of years. The report referred to by the Deputy will be a valuable element in this process.</P>

      <P>My Department has been actively engaged in efforts to ensure the safety of the person to whom the Deputy refers. Officials in the embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia, have been in contact with the person on a number of occasions since he went there last November.</P>
      <P>On 13 March 2002, he travelled to a remote rural area of Colombia. He was advised by the Colombian authorities that it was unsafe for him to travel there and that he risked attack if he continued his journey. On reaching this area, he became concerned for his security and sought the assistance of my Department in ensuring his safe passage back to the urban area where he had been based. My Department, through the embassy in Mexico, contacted the Colombian authorities and I can confirm that the person has now returned safely. He has been in contact with the embassy in Mexico and has expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.</P>
      <P>While the principal threat in this case may have been from the right-wing paramilitary forces, the person in question was also at risk from left-wing rebels who have engaged in widespread and often indiscriminate acts of violence in Colombia. In the current circumstances, it is not possible to guarantee the safety of any individual in certain areas of Colombia. My Department's strong advice to Irish citizens is that travel to Colombia should be undertaken only if absolutely necessary and should be confined to the relative safety of large urban areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is the interim report, published in April 2001, of the UN panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC. The panel also tabled an addendum report last November which addressed the issue in greater detail and concluded that most of the parties to the conflict in the DRC, including Uganda, were involved in the exploitation of the resources of the DRC. The panel of experts also concluded that without a resolution of the broader conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region, it would be highly unrealistic to expect an end to exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth in the country. Ireland agrees with this view.</P>
      <P>In the Security Council in December, Ireland stated that it is not prepared to see individuals, groups and states benefit from the resources of the DRC at the expense of the population of that country. We supported the panel looking at steps which the council might take to curb and control exploitation linked to the continuation of the conflict and for the panel to make detailed recommendations as to how existing international organisations and mechanisms could be used to control the exploitation. We also supported an extension of the mandate of the panel to allow it to investigate further and make concrete recommendations as to steps that might be taken to end exploitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the panel of experts that exploitation of resources in the DRC is one part of the problem which is inextricably linked to other serious issues in the region. I believe that imple<Col N="225" /> mentation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement offers the most viable solution to the conflict in the DRC and the end of the exploitation of the resources of that country for the benefit of parties other than the population of the DRC. For this reason, Ireland considers it essential that all foreign troops withdraw from the DRC, that the security concerns of neighbouring states, which contributed to the outbreak of the conflict, are resolved and that exploitation of resources, which fuels the conflict, end immediately. We have raised these issues directly with the Ugandan authorities and we will continue to work with them, and all the parties to the conflict, to implement fully the Lusaka ceasefire agreement and to bring about an end to exploitation linked to the conflict in the DRC.</P>
    <P>Ireland will be participating in a Security Council mission to the region at the end of this month. This mission, in addition to supporting the peace process and discussing with the parties the means of speeding up withdrawal of foreign troops, will take every opportunity to express to the parties, including Uganda, its concerns over the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the DRC and its link with the conflict.</P>
    <P>The Government has maintained and developed a programme of bilateral development co-operation with Uganda since 1994. Since our programme began, we have concentrated our efforts and our resources towards assisting the poorest of the poor and have been committed, but certainly not uncritical, partners of the Ugandan Government as it has made significant strides, including reducing the percentage of its people in dire poverty from 55% of the population to 35% in the space of seven years. As in the case of our other priority countries, we work with the Government to improve levels of transparency and good governance, while ensuring that all funds disbursed by Ireland Aid are monitored, using the highest possible accounting standards.</P>
    <P>Since the overthrow of the Obote regime in 1986, progress on all issues in the reconstruction and development of Uganda has been significantly advanced through active donor engagement. Since that time, Uganda has faced a daunting array of challenges including lawlessness, decentralisation, the reversal of spendthrift policies, economic and monetary reforms, press freedom, open presidential and parliamentary elections and the battle against HIV-AIDS. Ireland remains committed to continuing its aid partnership with Uganda but will not shy away from actively criticising policies which fall below internationally accepted standards. In this regard, I would like to draw attention to, and to strongly endorse, the section of the recently published report of the Ireland Aid review committee &ldquo;Governance, Democracy and Human Rights&rdquo; which recommends that all aspects of governance, democracy and human rights should continue to be an essential part of the dialogue between Ireland Aid and its partner governments. In par<Col N="226" /> ticular, increased resources should be made available to support public sector reform and anti-corruption measures, to strengthen financial management systems and in general to promote better governance in partner countries. This report will guide the future direction and operation of Ireland Aid.</P>

      <P>There are currently ten transport officers assigned to the enforcement unit in my Department's road haulage division. Their primary function is the enforcement of tachograph regulations through roadside checkpoints and premises visits. They also occasionally provide advice and information to drivers and operators to assist them in complying with those regulations.</P>
      <P>Since 2000 a total of 593 cases have been pursued in court by transport officers in respect of road haulage offences. So far 308 convictions have been obtained while approximately a further 135 cases are currently pending.</P>
      <P>While transport officers do not offer formal training programmes, they do occasionally provide informal information presentations on tachograph regulations and drivers' hours rules. Approximately 20 such presentations have been provided to date in response to requests from within the industry. This approach is entirely in line with my Department's commitment to supply up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive information under its customer service action plan. The provision of information which will improve awareness and assist operators in complying with the regulations is entirely compatible with the role transport officers play in relation to enforcement.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, open to private companies or individuals to offer formal training programmes and related training services to the industry. My Department would welcome such initiatives which can only serve to build on and complement the advisory and informational services being provided by transport officers.</P>

      <P>The Maynooth line was commissioned as a double track line in early 2000. Twenty diesel railcars were delivered to Iarnród Éireann in 2000 for use on the upgraded Maynooth line. These new railcars and associated track work have increased the capacity of the Maynooth line by over 100% at peak times. Investment on the doubling of the track on the line and the provision of 20 additional diesel railcars amounted to approximately &euro;55 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next major project to impact on the capacity of the route is the upgrading of Connolly Station. This project, currently at the design and planning stage, sets out to increase the capacity of the line between Connolly and Pearse Stations, thereby allowing extra trains, including trains <Col N="230" /> serving the Maynooth line, operate through the city centre.</P>
    <P>In addition, Iarnród Éireann will start taking delivery of further new diesel rail cars later this year, 76 of which will be used to enhance suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area, including the Maynooth line. The decision of how many and where the first of these railcars will go is an operational matter and not within my remit.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed me that over the past two years, a total of 38 new DART cars have been delivered; the final 12 of which are now entering service. These additional DART cars will allow the operation of all six-car DART trains at peak hour. The capacity of the DART system has increased by almost 50% since 2000.</P>
      <P>Exchequer funding of &euro;6.79 million was provided in respect of planning and design work on the DASH &ndash; DART expansion &ndash; project in 2001. This work is now almost complete. A further &euro;27 million in Exchequer funding has been allocated in 2002 and this is in respect of the first phase of the DASH project. With the funding now being made available, I expect the board of CIE to give formal approval shortly to proceed with the project. This phase of the project involves the lengthening of station platforms and the upgrading of the overhead power supply. These works, on completion, will allow for the operation of eight-car trains at peak hour providing a 30% increase in capacity on the DART network. Exchequer funding will also allow for a further 36 DART cars to be purchased by Iarnród Éireann. I expect the order for these new cars to be placed towards the end of this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, the Department has purchased several batteries of air defence guns including radars from the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The radar systems have the capacity to detect overflights by aircraft. The equipment has now been delivered to the Curragh Camp and has <Col N="232" /> significantly enhanced the air defence capabilities of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The possible acquisition of aircraft to fulfil an air defence role is also a consideration. In the detailed planning for the acquisition of training aircraft for the Irish Air Corps, consideration will be given to the possibility of including air defence capabilities in the aircraft.</P>
    <P>The most important defence against any terrorist attacks is detection and prevention by the security forces. The level of any terrorist threat is being continually assessed. The advice available to me would suggest that there is no reason to believe that Ireland or Irish air space is a direct target. However, it is prudent that we take precautions and keep matters under continuous review.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. M.

Such costs were also reimbursable in respect of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL. Troop costs in respect of these missions are calculated at the rate of about &euro;1,109 per person per month.</P>
    <P>The total amount of money due to my Department by the United Nations as at 31 March 2002, in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Force personnel in UN missions is calculated at &euro;9.29 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Continuous efforts are made to recover from the United Nations the moneys owed. These efforts are strenuously pursued with the United Nations on an ongoing basis by the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs in conjunction with the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York.  Both my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I take every opportunity to raise with the UN Ireland's concern regarding arrears. In 2001 the UN repaid arrears of &euro;7.957 million approximately almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL. Since 1 January 2002, the UN has repaid arrears of &euro;1.29 million approximately.   </P>

      <QRef>[10989/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): The type of situation described arises where the person in receipt of the early retirement pension entered the scheme under the joint management arrangement.</P>
    <P>Someone who enters the scheme in joint management is someone who, though involved in the management of the land that is being transferred, does not own some or any of it. A younger spouse or partner will often apply under the joint management arrangement because he or she can draw down the pension for longer than the other spouse or partner who is the actual owner of the pension lands. A joint management application can also happen when the applicant himself or herself does not own enough land to make up the maximum area of 24 hectares on which the pension can be paid, and brings in some other land owned by a spouse or family member.</P>
    <P>It is a provision of the EU regulations governing the early retirement schemes that any national retirement pension that a beneficiary is or becomes eligible for must be offset against the early retirement pension. In joint management cases, since eligibility for the early retirement pension is based partly or entirely on lands that the applicant himself or herself did not own, any national retirement pension that either party <Col N="235" /> qualifies for must be offset against the early retirement pension.</P>
    <P>As the gross amount of early retirement pension is fixed, any increase in the rate of old age pension, such as that granted in the 2002 budget, results in a reduction in the net amount of early retirement pension payable.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): The person named included a land parcel on his 2001 area aid application, which overlapped with that of another herd owner. Both herd owners were contacted in this regard and the matter has been resolved in favour of the other herd owner. The area aid application from the person named has now been fully processed and an area of 112.10 hectares has been determined for payment purposes.</P>
    <P>The person named applied for premium on 61 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. His full entitlement was paid on 8 April 2002 based on 60.8 animals, which is his suckler cow quota limit.</P>
    <P>The person named made three applications in respect of special beef premium 2001, on 23 May 2001, 9 July 2001 and 29 November 2001 in respect of a total of 28 animals. Advance payment issued on 11 April 2002, in respect of 27 animals. Payment on the remaining animal &ndash; tag no. 221138040085 &ndash; was delayed pending clarification of a movement record on the cattle movement monitoring system. This has now been resolved and payment will issue with balancing payments at the end of April.</P>
    <P>Advance payment in respect of the slaughter premium 2001 has issued to the person named in respect of 20 animals including an additional national envelope top-up payment in respect of one heifer slaughtered. Balancing payments on slaughter premium and national envelope 2001 scheme will issue next month when the national quota position is finalised.</P>

    <P>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): The persons named are shareholders in Lettertrask commonage, for which a commonage framework plan has been completed with a recommended de-stocking figure of 81%. The implementation rules for the framework plans as announced in February provide that, subject to compliance with the polluter pays principle and the planner being satisfied at individual farm level that no higher de-stocking is required, sheep de-stocking will not be greater than 50% for the year 2003 and 60% for 2004 on any commonage.</P>
    <P>At individual farm level, the de-stocking calculation is based on the 2001 quota, including quota frozen in the 30% interim de-stocking or under the first REP scheme. The total forage area available, including private forage land, is taken into account in determining stocking density on the <Col N="241" /> farm, but the de-stocking formula is applied only on the commonage area. As all the persons named are participants in REP scheme they should contact their respective REP scheme planners who will work out the level of de-stocking that will be required.</P>

      <P>The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. The person in question submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship and his application was examined by the tribunal. The tribunal did not, however, recommend an allocation of quota in this case and the person named has been notified of the outcome of his application. While every application to the tribunal is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner it has not been possible, within the constraints of the limited amount of quota available and the sizeable number of applications received, to meet the demands for quota from all applicants.</P>
      <P>When considering applications the tribunal gives priority to the following categories of producers: small scale producers whose entitlement to purchase quota under the 2000 and 2001 milk quota restructuring schemes was limited because of animal disease or personal illness or where insufficient quota was available in the applicant's co-operative or dairy; younger dairy farmers with small milk quotas; producers whose butterfat representative levels are very low; and producers who are in financial difficulty.</P>
      <P>In assessing these applications, the tribunal takes account of the following factors: current quota size; off-farm income and/or other farm enterprises; size of holding; family circumstances, including succession; commitment to dairying; and previous allocations from the national reserve.</P>
      <P>The person named may apply again when application forms for the 2002-03 milk quota year become available. The forms will be available from June 2002 from milk purchasers and from the milk policy division, Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Kildare Street, Dublin 2.</P>

      <P>Trade in horses between member states and from member states to third countries is governed by EU rules which establish the health conditions and health certification to be applied to such animals for trade purposes.</P>
      <P>Under trade rules in place between Ireland, France and the UK for many years, the tripartite agreement, based on a common animal health position in the equine sector, export licences are not required for trade in horses to the UK and Northern Ireland. For such export, the animals require to be individually identified via their own passports, or a current signed marking sheet. They are subject to a welfare check by an official veterinarian at the port of departure.</P>
      <P>Export licences issued in respect of horses to other destinations in recent years were in respect of breeding, racing or jumping-sport use and export licences have not been or are not issued in respect of horses for slaughter.</P>
      <P>This Department does not and has not issued export licences for equidae for slaughter. All equidae certified by this Department as the designated competent authority are certified for the purposes I have outlined above.</P>
      <P>With regard to replies to correspondence received by my Department, the correspondent referred to in the question does not identify the name of the group she represents. However, I can confirm that my Department has replied to letters on this issue on 16 January 2002, 27 February 2002, 28 February 2002, and 27 March 2002.</P>

      <P>In 1999, applicants under the livestock premium schemes could qualify for extensification premium provided the stocking density was less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare. The person named applied for grants in respect of 54 suckler cows, 133 bullocks and 79 ewes. He declared a forage area of 109.11 hectares. The stocking density was therefore calculated at 1.4 livestock units per hectare. Since the regulation states that the stocking density must be less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare, the applicant was deemed to be ineligible for extensification premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" />Under EU regulations, the number of ewes to be taken into account for the stocking density calculation is the number submitted for ewe premium. In this case the applicant declared on 20 April 1999 that he had retained all 79 ewes for the retention period which ended on the 18 April 1999. The applicant submitted evidence to show that three sheep were missing from his flock at the time the application under the 1999 ewe premium scheme was lodged. Medical evidence showing that his wife, who completed the application form, was unwell at that time was also submitted. My Department has examined the documentation and the position is that there is contradictory evidence regarding the dates on which the sheep went missing. Consequently, my Department is unable to accept the evidence supplied. With regard to the medical evidence submitted the position is that the applicant is the sole registered flock owner and as such the onus was on him to ensure that the application contained accurate information when he signed it.</P>

In recent years however, I have made <i>ex gratia</i> funding available to a number of appropriate bodies involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services throughout the country, having regard to resources available to me from within the Department's Vote at end-year. In December 2001 grants totalling &euro;650,741, £512,500 were awarded to 52 organisations to assist them in their activities. Sligo SPCA was awarded grant aid of &euro;6,348, £5,000, in 2000 and &euro;8,888, £7,000, in 2001.</P>
      <P>As the payment of such aid is invariably an end-of-year exercise dependent on the resources available within the Department's Vote, the possibility of any disbursements in 2002 to any animal welfare bodies cannot be addressed until much later this year.</P>

      <P>The herd owner lodged an appeal regarding the late submission of his 2001 area aid application. Following a full examination of this case the headage and premium appeals unit found that the decision taken by the area aid unit was correct and consequently the appeal was unsuccessful. The updated medical evidence submitted subsequently has now been considered and the headage and premium appeals unit has indicated that it does not represent sufficient grounds to overturn the original decision.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for five cows and one heifer under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. An advance payment based on six animals was paid to him on 18 December 2001. Area aid records show that the applicant has a forage area of less than 7.5 hectares. He is therefore entitled to premia payments on a maximum of 15 livestock units. As the person named has now been paid <Col N="254" /> on 11.4 special beef premium livestock units, calculations at balancing payment stage under the suckler cow scheme show 3.6 livestock units eligible for payment. The amount due was recalculated based on three cows and one heifer under two years.

Both herd owners were written to and the matter was resolved in favour of the other herd owner.

      <P>Under the EU regulations, no penalty is applied when the over-claim is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when the over-claim is between 3% and 20% and when the over-claim is greater than 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore in this instance, a 100% penalty applies and no area aid linked payments, including suckler cow grants, can issue to the applicant.</P>

      <P>The requirement that applicants for aid under the various farm investment schemes have a minimum of 20 income units from farming has been specifically laid down by the EU Commission. This is to meet the general requirement, established in Council Regulation No. 1257/99, that all applicants pass the test of economic viability.</P>
      <P>I have raised this issue with the EU Commission in an effort to secure the right to open up the farm waste management scheme in particular to farmers with less than 20 income units, in the interests of environmental protection. Unfortunately, despite extensive discussions with the EU Commission last year, the Commission has not deemed it appropriate to adjust this requirement. The matter is still under consideration and the possibility of securing specific changes to EU legislation which could allow for the introduction of a realistic scheme for small farmers, particularly for farm waste management, continues to be pursued.</P>

      <P>The EU Council regulation under which the early retirement scheme was introduced requires an applicant to have practised farming for the ten years before he or she transfers the holding. To meet this requirement, the scheme requires that at the time of transfer an applicant must derive not less than 25% of his or her total income from farming.</P>
      <P>This requirement is much less stringent than the rule under the previous scheme that an applicant had to have farmed as a main occupation. It is an acknowledgement of the fact that many farmers need to supplement their income from sources outside of farming. The threshold of 25% used to determine eligibility is not considered unreasonable and there are no plans to change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>The maximum amount of pension payable under the current early retirement scheme is &euro;13,515. This comprises a basic payment of &euro;5,403 that all participants receive regardless of the size of their holding, and &euro;338 per hectare up to a maximum of 24 hectares (59.3 acres).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal stated objectives of the early retirement scheme is the improvement of the economic viability of agricultural holdings. The rate of pension payable is determined by the extent to which the retiring farmer contributes to this objective through the release of his or her land. Given that the average farm size (on the most recent data available) is 29.3 hectares, the area of 24 hectares required to maximise the pen<Col N="264" /> sion enables many farmers with small to medium-sized holdings to do so. The significant basic payment also ensures that the scheme remains attractive to those farmers with much smaller holdings who are unable to qualify for the maximum payment. In all the circumstances the threshold is not considered unreasonable and there are no plans to change it.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the revision of the pay and contractual arrangements in respect of the current chief executive of Bord na gCon, in accordance with the most recent developments in relation to the pay of chief executives in the public sector generally, have recently been finalised by the board and are currently under active consideration by my Department and the Department of Finance. All disclosures relating to the total remuneration of the chief executive and the fees and expenses paid to board members required by the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, which came into effect on 2 October 2001, will be made in accordance with the provisions of that code in the next annual report to be published by the board and in the report of the chairman to me.</P>

      <P>The person named claimed a parcel of land on his 2001 area aid <Col N="268" /> application that was also claimed by another person. To establish who was legitimately entitled to claim it, in November 2001 the area aid unit wrote to both parties. On 9 January 2002, the other person submitted a Land Registry copy folio showing that he was entitled to claim the parcel in question.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Commission Regulation 3887/92, where the difference in area between the area declared and the area found is greater than 20%, area-based payments are not permissible. In this case the over-declaration amounted to 26.3%. The person named is a participant under special beef premium, extensification premium and the area based compensatory allowances schemes for 2001.</P>
      <P>Given the foregoing and in compliance with EU regulations, it would seem that my Department has no option but to maintain its decision in this case. I am, however, arranging for an officer of my Department to visit the person named with a view to establishing the reason he included the parcel in question on his area aid application for 2001.</P>

The person named subsequently notified my Department of her intention to transfer a site measuring 0.28 hectares to her daughter. My Department advised her that it had no objection to this proposal but that it would result in a reduction in her pension retrospective to the date of her entry to the scheme. The person named subsequently completed the transfer of the site to her daughter, as a consequence of which her pension must be reduced by &euro;84.53 per annum retrospective to her entry to the scheme.

I am pleased to say that the industrial action has been suspended from this morning. This suspension allows the Labour Relations Commission to intervene in the matter.</P>
      <P>The protocol on direct payments to farmers sets specific processing and payment targets for REPS payments. As a consequence of the industrial action, my Department will not now be able to achieve these targets in a number of cases. However, all outstanding REPS payments applications will be processed as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. The person in question submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship and his application was examined by the tribunal. The tribunal did not, however, recommend an allocation of quota in this case and the person named has been notified of the outcome of his application. While every application to the tribunal is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner it has not been possible, within the constraints of the limited amount of quota available and the sizeable number of applications received, to meet the demands for quota from all applicants.</P>
      <P>The person named may apply when application forms for the 2002-03 milk quota year become available. The forms will be available from June 2002 from co-operatives and from the milk policy division, Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Kildare Street, Dublin 2.</P>

      <P>A number of ongoing meetings have taken place between my officials in the Office of Public Works and representatives of Kildare County Council in relation to reports received from the council in respect of flooding from Meadowbrook, Lyreen and Morrell rivers. The current position is that the county council has identified a series of interim measures that might be taken to alleviate flooding but a report by the council's consultant is awaited on the question of whether these works may have adverse impacts elsewhere. The council is also engaged in extending the scope of the existing reports already received to include an environmental impact study and cost benefit analysis which are essential before a full feasibility study in relation to the reports can be undertaken. Until such time as the consultant's report and the EIS and CBA are available, it is not possible to determine the definitive programme of works which will be undertaken and the amount of funding to be expended.</P>

While VAT is a liability on all consumers, the structure of VAT, with zero rating on many basic products, is intended to alleviate the burden on more vulnerable sections of the community.

This is to ensure that all mitigation measures relating to fisheries habitat will be done in consultation with the two boards.

Upon completion of the construction works, the riverbed and fisheries habitat will be reinstated by Office of Public Works under the direction of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.

The exemption is only available to individuals who are either resident in the State and not resident elsewhere, or ordinarily resident and domiciled in the State and not resident elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, formerly section 2 of the 1969 Finance Act, allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination, under guidelines drawn up by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and an Comhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, that certain artistic works are original and creative works generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Accordingly, earnings derived from such works are exempt from income tax.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of section 195, the Revenue Commissioners can make determinations in respect of artistic works in the following categories: a book or other writing, a play, a musical composition, a painting or other like picture, and a sculpture. Choreography is not a specified category within section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, and therefore the artists exemption is not available to choreographers.

      <P>The seed capital scheme was introduced in 1993 as an incentive to encourage individuals to start up new businesses. The scheme provides a refund of tax paid in the previous six years to employees who leave employment and start their own business. To qualify for the refund, the individual must comply with certain conditions and the company must be carrying on a qualifying trade, that is, manufacturing, certain tourism activities etc. The company must also be certified by an appropriate agency such as a county enterprise board. The size of the refund depends on the amount of the individual's investment and effective tax rate. There is an upper limit in any one year of the tax paid on income of &euro;31,750.</P>
      <P>The business expansion scheme may also be availed of by companies to which the seed capital scheme applies. Details of both schemes are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.</P>

Marginal relief applies where the income is between &euro;254,000 and &euro;317,500.</P>

I sanctioned 11 new posts in June 2000, of which four were assigned to the toxicology area, and I sanctioned a further two new posts in December 2001 specifically for this area. State Laboratory management has informed me that it is seeking to clear the existing backlog of human toxicology tests and, with this new staffing complement fully in place, it will aim to achieve a regular processing time for these tests of a minimum of three weeks and a maximum of eight weeks, subject to the complexity of the analyses required.</P>

The exceptions are re-insurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.

The proceeds fund the general requirements of the Exchequer and are not and have never been dedicated to any specific purpose. The yield for 2001 was &euro;69.11 million.

      <Quest>the situation in relation to the liability for capital gains tax on the sale of a taxi plate by a person with spare income tax exemption; if the sale of a plate for approximately £5,000 is liable; the way in which it would be calculated, as the plate is in the same ownership since the 1970s; and if tax would be due or could be offset against a person's income tax exemption limit where they have plenty of spare capacity.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the sale of a taxi plate is regarded as the disposal of a chargeable asset for capital gains tax purposes. The question of whether a gain arises will depend on the facts of the case. The general position is that the price obtained for the taxi plate is reduced by the price originally paid for the plate and any professional fees associated with the acquisition. The price originally paid and the fees associated with the acquisition of the plate, if any, may be adjusted to take account of the inflation content of those costs. If there are any costs arising from the disposal of the taxi plate, these are also deducted from the price obtained for the taxi plate. Any resultant gain is reduced by the annual exempt amount and the balance is charged to capital gains tax at the current rate of 20%.</P>
      <P>The following example illustrates how the calculation is carried out. It assumes that the taxi plate was acquired in the tax year 1977-78 and disposed of in 2002. The calculation is in euros.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 and 258 together.</P>
      <P>The question of restoring pensions parity does not arise since it has not been removed. The position is that, in the Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government gave an undertaking to protect public service pensions. On foot of this undertaking, I announced in November 1997 the Government's decision that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates of those deals, with a guaranteed minimum increase of 3%.</P>
      <P>I also said that policy in relation to any future restructuring deals would be determined in the light of the recommendations contained in the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions. That commission had been established by the previous Government to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements of public servants. In the meantime, in the period since November 1997, the benefit of all relevant pay increases under Partnership 2000 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been passed on to pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions was published in January 2001. On 28 September 2001 the Government announced that it had decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and to establish the working group to advise on implementation provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. <Col N="285" /> The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by the Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group.</P>
    <P>The working group was established on 10 January 2002 and its main sub-group has met on a regular basis since then. It is hoped that the working group will be in a position to report within the next few months. Parallel structures, subject to the same timeframe and remit, have been established in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The commission recommends, <i>inter alia</i>, continuation of pension increases in line with public service earnings and also recommends that serving public servants make an additional explicit contribution towards the cost involved. In a change from the existing form of pay parity, the commission proposes that a single index of public service earnings be used in the future with pension increases based on changes in the index to be paid automatically on a twice-yearly basis.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the public service union representatives on the commission welcomed in general terms the &ldquo;recommendations for the establishment of a public service pensions index and the recommendation, through the use of this mechanism, for the maintenance of the system of pension increases by reference to the pay increases of serving staff&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Public service pensioners clearly have a very significant interest in these recommendations. For this reason, the Government has decided to facilitate pensioner group representation in the working group process in relation to the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy. As a first step, a number of pensioner groups, including the National Association of Retired Public Employees, attended a preliminary meeting with my Department on 11 December 2001. The information and consultation process, the arrangements for which are being finalised, will include the issue of an information leaflet to pensioners, the holding of information seminars in venues around the country, and the convening of a pensioner representative forum for the purpose of electing pensioner nominees to participate in a pension index sub-committee of the PPF implementation working group referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>The above clearly sets out the Government's commitment in relation to public service pensions and the actions which the Government has taken to deliver on that commitment. As I have shown, pensioners and their representatives groups will have an opportunity in the months ahead to have the commission recommendations explained and examined in more detail and to participate in the consultation process which I have initiated in relation to future pensions increase policy.</P>

      <P>Two flood relief schemes in the Mulkear River catchment at Newport, County Tipperary, and Cappamore, County Limerick, were completed by the Office of Public Works in 1998 and 2000 respectively. The Office of Public Works retained the services of the Central Fisheries Board before, during and since the execution of the Mulkear catchment drainage schemes. This body provided advice on mitigation measures in relation to the fisheries habitat and is monitoring the effect of the works on the fish population. This monitoring has not to date shown any significant deterioration in fish stocks resulting from the flood relief schemes. Discussions on fishery enhancement measures on the wider Mulkear catchment are ongoing with the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and local fisheries interests.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that no decision in relation to a new programme of decentralisation will be taken in advance of the forthcoming general election. Work is, however, continuing in my Department with a view to enabling decisions to be taken shortly after the election. In that regard, consideration is being given to the Departments/offices which will be part of the new programme as well as to the centres to which they will relocate. While no decisions have yet been taken, the cases made for the inclusion of several centres in the Cork area will be fully considered as part of the deliberations which will precede a Government decision on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268, 278 and 287 together.</P>
      <P>I have recently appointed the primary care task force, which is a small group of officials drawn from my Department and from the health boards. There was some delay in arranging for the release of the members to serve on the task force, but I am confident that this will be made up for as the task force carries out its work. The task force, which had its first meeting on 9 April, will drive the implementation of Primary Care: A New Direction, the primary care strategy which I launched as part of the health strategy. The task force is interdisciplinary and will report to a wider steering group, which will include representatives from primary care professional groups, unions, the community and voluntary sector and other relevant stakeholders. The steering group will be chaired by Professor Ivan Perry, University College Cork. The work of the task force will have to involve a detailed process of communication with stakeholders to ensure that people are informed of and involved in the developments which will take place in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary care strategy proposes the introduction of an interdisciplinary, team-based approach. These changes will improve access for all to primary care services, especially out of hours, will improve the links between primary and secondary care and will emphasise the importance of prevention of disease and health promotion. It will also help to make primary care <Col N="291" /> a more satisfying and rewarding career by providing an environment in which each person and profession can maximise his-her contribution.</P>
    <P>It will also enable care to develop the capacity to meet the future challenges with which it is faced such as ageing of the population capacity and retention of human resources, earlier hospital discharge, care in appropriate settings as well as the opportunities afforded through modern information and communications technology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269, 270, 311, 315, 351 and 358 to 361, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the delays being experienced by applicants for inter-country adoption assessment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority as evident in the latest statistics which I have received from the ERHA. For the past two years I have worked closely with various groups involved in this area in an effort to provide a better service. I accept that the shortage in social workers is leading to intolerable delays for couples who have already experienced a lot of personal trauma.</P>
      <P>Delays have arisen over the last few years because of an increased interest in inter-country adoption, and difficulties being experienced in the ERHA region in recruiting social workers. Funding has been provided in the ERHA area for more than 20 social workers to carry out assessments but only 10.5 social workers are actually in place due to recruitment problems.</P>
      <P>Extra administrative personnel and office facilities have also been provided to free up social workers to concentrate on assessments and to reduce travelling time. Efforts are being made to deal with the current shortage of social workers by recruiting internationally and by increasing the number of training places nationally. Approximately 30 additional social work training places have been created since October 2001 and it is planned to increase the number of places by in excess of 85 to be phased in from 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past four years a number of improvements have been put in place to facilitate couples who wish to adopt children from abroad. A standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment was introduced to streamline assessments and to provide a transparent system <Col N="293" /> centred on the child's best interests and respectful to all the parties involved. This includes a guide for practitioners on the assessment process which was prepared by British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, international leaders in the field. The framework has been welcomed by both health boards and couples.</P>
    <P>A sum of &euro;2.101 million or £1.655 million in additional funding has been provided nationally to reduce the time spent by couples on the waiting lists, mainly through the recruitment of additional social worker and administrative staff. Almost &euro;830,000 or £653,000 of this additional funding has been provided to the ERHA.</P>
    <P>Working agreements have been made with China, Thailand, Belarus and the Philippines, legislation is being prepared to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, 1993, and the recommendations of the organisation and management review of the Adoption Board are being implemented.</P>
    <P>I have previously written to all other health boards asking them to assist the ERHA in reducing their waiting lists and I again asked them for their help at the conference on inter-country adoption, Sharing Best Practice, which I attended last week. Some boards have said they were in a position to help with preparation courses and this offer is being acted upon.</P>
    <P>I have also put the ERHA in touch with the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering with a view to seeing if it is in a position to assist the ERHA in carrying out inter-country adoption assessments. The ERHA is establishing two new assessment units in the East Coast and Northern Area Health Boards to supplement the service for the region being provided by the South-Western Area Health Board. I understand that four new social workers are likely to be in place by <Col N="294" /> June 2002. The restructuring of the service will take place on a phased basis when the additional staff have come on board. A customer services officer to provide accurate information is also being appointed.</P>
    <P>My Department collects statistics from each of the health boards in respect of inter-country adoption at the end of every quarter. The latest quarter for which information is available is the end of December 2001. Table 1 below outlines the number of assessments completed in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area for the past four years. While the number of cases finalised decreased in 2000, it increased significantly in 2001. The ERHA has informed me that the duration of assessment in the region is nine to ten months.</P>

    <P>There is no specific age limit which would exclude a couple from being assessed, although age is a significant factor which would be taken into account, along with health and family circumstances in assessing capacity to adopt. In regard to concerns about couples in their mid-30s being rejected by sending countries on age grounds as a result of excessive delays, I should clarify that some countries impose their own age limits. This is outside the control of the Irish authorities.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive strategic policy framework for the acute hospital sector is set out in the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health <Col N="296" /> System for You. Central to this policy framework is the decision by the Government to significantly increase bed capacity in acute hospitals over the next ten years.</P>

This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In tandem with the publication of the report, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 acute hospital beds in the current year at a cost of &euro;65 million.

      <P>Last summer I met representatives of the Irish Heart Foundation's council on stroke regarding their proposals for the development of stroke units to provide patients with dedicated specialists in stroke care, an associated interdisciplinary team, appropriate diagnostic technology and a clearly defined continuum of care. I indicated that I was very interested in the proposals and accordingly requested that the council develop and cost its proposals with a view to the establishment of a pilot programme in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January I received an outline submission from the Irish Heart Foundation which is being considered by my officials in the context of the cardiovascular strategy framework, Building Healthier Hearts, Primary Care &ndash; A New Direction, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System <Col N="300" /> for You, and the recently completed national review of the acute hospital bed capacity. The latter report highlighted the need for additional rehabilitation beds to meet the needs of young chronic sick and older people with specific conditions who require continuing care in a setting appropriate to their needs. When this process is complete my Department will issue a response to the Irish Heart Foundation.</P>

      <P>The Government has already shown its commitment to the health services by allocating an extra &euro;4.69 billion for capital and non-capital funding since 1997 or a 134% increase which represents the greatest ever increase in spending on these services. It has resulted in significant service developments across all major programmes in the health services, including services in the non-acute hospital sector, such as the disabled, services for older people, child care, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" />In regard to the health strategy, I agree fully with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that we cannot fund the health strategy if we do not demonstrate clear value for money from the extra investment, including identification of the outputs and outcomes of that investment. The strategy sets out a programme of reform of the services including a strong emphasis on equity and accountability and I am confident that this reform agenda of the strategy will help to deliver a more efficient and effective service than ever before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no agreement between this country and the United States of America for the transfer of health care entitlements. Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residence and means. Any person who is accepted by the health boards-authority as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1 &ndash; medical card holders, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards-authority normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he-she satisfies the health board-authority that it is his/her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services, including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services, all out-patient services, including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service. Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services, and out-patient public hospital services, including consultant services.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board-authority, aside from people over the age of 70 years who are automatically entitled to a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that, for those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness <Col N="303" /> scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drug payment scheme, a person and his-her dependants do not have to pay more than &euro;53.33 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputies that I have decided to establish an appropriate task force to investigate the incidence and the reasons for assaults on psychiatric nurses with a view to designing programmes aimed at prevention.</P>
      <P>While it is recognised that it may be difficult to deal with the issue of a compensation scheme in relation to any one group of health service workers in isolation from other public sector groups, regard will be had to the recommendations of the task force on the feasibility of an appropriate compensation scheme.</P>
      <P>My officials will make arrangements for the establishment of this task force at the earliest possible date. Every effort will be made to ensure that the task force completes its work by 1 December 2002. The terms of reference for the task force will include the following: &ldquo;To examine and report on the factors relevant to the introduction of an appropriate compensation scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Burke, the question of a compensation scheme was addressed in the accident and emergency activity management agreement brokered by the Labour Relations Commission last month. The management side gave a commitment at that time to have early discussions within the context of the wider health service under the auspices of the Health Service National <Col N="304" /> Joint Council. I am advised arrangements are in train to progress the matter through the National Joint Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282, 331 and 365 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date, more than 50,000 women have been called for screening and more than 34,000 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of 70%.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance and best practice and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nationwide. All the health boards located outside the phase one area are represented on the board of BreastCheck by their respective chief executive officers.  </P>
      <P>My Department has been in ongoing consultation with BreastCheck concerning expansion of the programme and will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to nationwide coverage as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department is involved in the design brief development of community nursing units-community hospitals and ensures that best practice standards are specified and scheduled for the procurement process.</P>
      <P>Community nursing units-community hospitals are designed to current best practice standards which include adequate space per patient for day-treatment-bed-toilet accommodation. The space per patient varies and relates to the type of patient being accommodated. More dependent patients require greater bed space than ambulant patients who can avail of and use day-dining facilities.</P>
      <P>Adequate toilet accommodation &ndash; bath, shower, WC, wash hand basin &ndash; is provided to each unit-hospital to meet the needs of the patients, staff and visitors. Toilet accommodation is designed and located to minimise travel distances for users, including those with disabilities. All facilities are designed to comply the requirement of the building regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" />Many older buildings do not meet current standards, particularly related to the number and location of toilet facilities, access for people with disabilities and area per patient. This is primarily due to the plan format, structure and number of floors of the buildings which allow little flexibility for upgrading to current standards. Upgrading of many older buildings has been carried out by the health agencies and while, in some cases, further upgrading is required to meet current standards, a substantial improvement in patient comfort and privacy has been achieved.</P>

      <P>The new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, sets out the actions aimed at addressing capacity, improving equity for public patients and streamlining efficiency in the hospital system. These actions include the provision of additional acute beds, the establishment of a national hospitals agency, reforming the management and organisation of waiting lists, the establishment of a treatment purchase fund and a programme of improvements in accident and emergency departments. These measures are being taken to safeguard the interests of public patients and to address unacceptably long waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health strategy makes specific mention that action may be taken if the maximum target waiting time for public patients is exceeded. If the health boards and the ERHA conclude that targets for reduction of waiting times are not being achieved, despite implementation of these actions, a hospital may be directed to suspend admission of private patients for elective procedures in a speciality until the waiting time for public patients is restored to within the target period of time. This direction can be set aside if hospital management and the consultants can agree on alternative means of restoring the target waiting time. This measure offers an important <Col N="312" /> safeguard to the interests of public patients. It provides an incentive for hospitals and consultants to use all available means to address unacceptably long waiters. This matter will be pursued in the context of the strategy commitment to the reform of the management and organisation of waiting lists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear to which study the Deputy is referring. A study in relation to Hepatitis B was published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in November 2001. This study was a cross sectional survey looking at the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV and risk factors in entrants to Irish prisons. It concluded:</P>
      <P>The use of injected drugs and infection with Hepatitis C virus are endemic in Irish prisons; a third of prison entrants are being committed to prison for the first time; only a small number of first time entrants are infected with one or more of the viruses; the findings confirm the need for increased infection control and harm reduction measures in Irish prisons.</P>
      <P>A study published in December 2000 demonstrated a low prevalence of hepatitis B infection in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" />Information provided by the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, indicates that there has been an increase in the number of cases of Hepatitis B notified in Ireland over the last five years.  Notifications in respect of each of the years 1997-2001 are as follows: 1997, 31; 1998, 155; 1999, 160; 2000, 187; 2001 346 provisional. The increase may reflect increased testing for hepatitis B and increased reporting of infection by clinicians due to increased awareness of the problems associated with hepatitis B. The increase may also reflect a real increase in the incidence and prevalence of infection.</P>
    <P>There is evidence to indicate under-notification of hepatitis B. A system of enhanced surveillance of hepatitis B notified cases, to collect data on the risk factors associated with infections is planned. This data will be collated nationally and reported on by NDSC.</P>
    <P>The report of the group to review the structure of prison health care services recommended that &ldquo;the Prisons Service, Department of Health and Children and local health boards should ensure that proper structures and protocols are in place to ensure a consistent and equivalent approach to the issue of infectious diseases&rdquo;. A group on which my Department is represented has been set up to implement the recommendations of this report.</P>

      <P>The Health Service is an equal opportunities employer. Therefore all new consultant posts are filled by candidates with the appropriate qualifications and experience for the post. At 1 January 2002, the percentage of permanent consultant posts held by women was 23%.</P>
      <P>The number of women being appointed to new consultant posts continues to rise. In the ten year period from 1991 to 2001, the percentage of women taking up new consultant posts has risen from 18% of all new consultants in 1991, to 41% of all new consultants in 2001.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I established the National Task Force on Medical Staffing in February. The task force is engaged in drawing up a detailed implementation plan based on the recommendations in the report of the medical manpower forum and the report of the joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors. Those recommendations include proposals for identifying impediments to the advancement of women within our existing acute hospital system and training structures, and devising appropriate measures to overcome such barriers. The proposals in both reports for more flexible working and training are likely to be particularly relevant in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" />I am confident that the work of the task force will result in the implementation of a range of practical measures to make it more attractive for women to train and work as consultants in our hospital system and thereby make a significant contribution to the process of bringing overall consultant numbers more closely into line with the gender balance among doctors in training.</P>

      <P>The overall approach to developing the strategy has been guided by a steering group comprising of representatives of my Department, the health boards and health organisations. A project team was responsible for co-ordinating the work and preparing the final draft of the strategy. I established a series of working groups to make recommendations on key themes that will inform the strategy, such as those relating to improved information for the consumers of health services, e-health, security and use of data. In addition, I initiated a wide ranging consultation process in relation to this strategy. This involved representatives of all of the key stakeholders as well as consultations with members of the public, staff of the health services, health boards and other agencies. As a result of the approach adopted by my Department, the national health information strategy will be a most valuable document that will help inform all aspects of the health services and in so doing, support the achievement of many of the aims of the health strategy.</P>

      <P>The Nurses Act, 1985, number 18 of 1985, provides <i>inter alia</i> for the registration, control and education of nurses and to provide for other matters relating to the practice of nursing and the persons engaged in such practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Act provides the following interpretations: &ldquo;Midwife&rdquo; means a person whose name is entered in the midwives division of the register; &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; means a woman or a man whose name is entered in the register and includes a midwife and &ldquo;nursing&rdquo; includes &ldquo;midwifery&rdquo;; &ldquo;the register&rdquo; means the register of nurses established under Section 27 of this Act. A nurse therefore is a person whose name is entered in the Register of Nurses established pursuant to Section 27 of the Nurses Act, 1985. Section 49 of <Col N="316" /> the Act creates an offence for the improper use of the title of nurse or midwife and a person found guilty on summary conviction would be liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,269 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or at the discretion of the court to both penalties.</P>
    <P>In 1994 a successful prosecution was taken by An Bord Altranais against a person for the unlawful use of the title of nurse and for making a false declaration in relation to an application for registration. This was the only prosecution taken by An Bord Altranais under the 1985 Act. An Bord Altranais has not received any other communications from any other body seeking to take a prosecution against a person for the unlawful use of the title of nurse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 334, 350 and 393 together.</P>
      <P>The retail pharmacy sector has not been deregulated. It is subject to a wide range of legislative controls. The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act. The 1996 regulations, which I revoked in January this year following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts with the health boards.</P>
      <P>The effect of the revocation, for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts, is that there are no restrictions on granting new community pharmacy contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapsed with the regulations. Those affected should contact the relevant health board directly concerning re-applying.</P>
      <P>I have already met with representatives of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to discuss their concerns following the revocation of S.I. No. 152 of 1996. Ongoing discussions are taking place between officials from my Department and representatives of the IPU.</P>
      <P>The pharmacy review group was established to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. It is now being asked to report as quickly as possible, given the new situation. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. I am considering a number of options pending the completion of the work of the group and I hope to be in a position to make a decision on the matter shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of national lottery funding which was made available to the Motor Neurone Disease Association for the expansion and maintenance of their equipment bank during each year since 1999; and if an increased grant will be made in 2002 as no grant was obtained in 2001.</Quest>

      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that there is a set protocol in place for processing applications for national lottery grants. When an application is received in my Department it is registered in the finance unit and forwarded to the relevant <Col N="325" /> services division for their assessment, evaluation and recommendation. All applications are then considered in the context of the recommendation and the overall level of funds available.</P>
      <P>The organisation referred to by the Deputy has received grants from the departmental allocation of national lottery funds towards the maintenance and expansion of their equipment bank since 1999 as follows: 1999, £10,000 (&euro;12,697.38); 2000, £80,000 (&euro;101,579.05); 2001 Nil. While the national lottery application submitted in 2001 was recommended for a grant by the services division the number of applications received far exceeded the available resources and it was not possible to assist in this particular case during 2001. The organisation was informed of this on the 8 January 2002 and advised that they may apply for a grant from the 2002 national lottery allocation if funding for this project was still required.</P>
      <P>My Department received an application for a grant from the 2002 Department of Health and Children allocation of national lottery funds on the 18 January 2002 from the organisation referred to by the Deputy. The organisation is again seeking funding towards the maintenance and expansion of their equipment bank. The application is under consideration for a grant from my Department and the organisation will be informed as soon as a decision has been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parent's nursing home care was deleted from 1 January, 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards/Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. As a result of the deliberations of this group, and, taking cognisance of legal advice available, guidelines as to how the payments should be made issued from my Department at the end of October, 2001. Funding was made available to commence making these payments from 1 November 2001, with further funding provided in 2002.</P>
      <P>Following the issuing of these guidelines, my Department continued to liaise with the health boards in relation to the making of payments. When it was brought to the attention of my Department that in a number of cases, the cost to claimants in obtaining letters of administration exceeds the value of moneys to be paid, further guidelines for making these payments in these circumstances issued from my Department. Health boards were advised that it is open to them to exercise an element of discretion in these cases in that once a health board has satisfied itself, within reason, that the money is being claimed by the appropriate person, the board should take into consideration the amount to be paid. It was suggested that in cases where the money to be paid is up to &euro;500, the board may waive the requirement for letters of administration if it is reasonably satisfied the money is being paid to the person entitled to receive it.</P>
      <P>It is not my wish, nor the wish of my Department, that anyone should be disadvantaged by the requirement to obtain letters of administration or a grant of probate. Nonetheless, it was deemed that these documents are necessary to protect the interests of the estate of any person whose subvention had been abated, but may have since died.</P>

This means the total revenue funding available in the current year is &euro;254,400. In addition, a once-off grant of &euro;195,500 was made available in 1999 to help towards equipping costs while a grant of &euro;127,000 was paid in 2001, from discretionary lottery funds, for a range of additional facilities.</P>
      <P>My Department has no ongoing involvement in running the centre, has no legal attachment to the centre nor is it represented on the board of directors or management committee. The question has been raised as to whether this centre should be registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and I understand that the legal situation in relation to this is being examined by the Western Health Board at present.</P>

When I announced approval for the project in 2001, a project cost in excess of &euro;57.14 million, £45 million, was estimated for this phase of the development of this hospital. The expected expenditure in 2002 is &euro;0.6 million mainly on fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new wing of Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar will be ready for bed occupancy significantly in advance of the anticipated project completion date. A building &lsquo;shell' to facilitate the future development of the hospital was included <Col N="334" /> in the previous phase of development (2A) at the board's request.</P>
    <P>The new Regional General Hospital at Tullamore is currently at tendering stage. Tenders are currently being sought from contractors to build the new hospital, the closing date for which is 16 May 2002. It would not be appropriate at this point to comment on the expected results of this tender process while tenders are awaited.</P>

      <P>The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient units be developed throughout the country. The recommended size for each unit is 20 beds providing six beds for the under 12 age group and 14 beds for the 12-16 age group. However, the report also stated that health boards may wish to vary numbers depending on need in their own areas.</P>
      <P>The report stated that, given the small population of the North-Western Health Board, the provision of a 20 bedded unit in the area would be difficult to justify. I am informed that the North-Western Health Board is currently considering this matter and plans to submit a proposal to my Department in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383 and 411 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) is the statutory responsibility of the authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have taken a range of important measures to improve the capacity of the public orthodontic services and place it on a sound long-term footing.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic <Col N="338" /> service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations. The introduction of the specialist grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>In addition, four dentists from the ERHA commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.405 million to the authority in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>In order to enable the achievement of greater caseloads, the Dental Council has submitted to my Department a draft scheme to recognise auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics. This grade &ndash; to be known as orthodontic therapist &ndash; will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment. The scheme is currently being examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Additional funding of &euro;2.971 million was provided to the ERHA in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;2.044 million was for its orthodontic initiative. This has enabled the authority to recruit additional staff &ndash; including two consultant orthodontists &ndash; and develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James' Hospital.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, the initiatives that I have set out above will bring about an improvement in waiting times and I am considering other options whereby children who have been waiting for an extended period can be treated free of charge privately. There is currently no mechanism for reimbursing costs of orthodontic treatment received independent of the Authority. However, tax <Col N="339" /> relief is available in respect of such treatment costs.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 3,776 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority. This is an increase of 488 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the corresponding figure at the end of the September 2001 quarter. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures in the orthodontic initiative take effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend the scheme to include persons with polio.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
      <P>The provision of health related services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including those with post-polio syndrome, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Health boards provide a range of support services to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible within the community. This includes residential respite care, day care, home support, including personal assistance services, nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant additional funding of over &euro;175 million has been provided by this Government since coming into office. This level of funding indicates the Government's ongoing commitment to the provision of quality services. In addition to this level of funding, my Department, in conjunction with the health research board, the health <Col N="341" /> boards and the voluntary sector service providers, is currently developing the national physical and sensory disability database, which I recently launched. When complete, the database will provide at local level, a detailed picture of each individual's health service requirements over a five year period; at national level, detailed statistical information to assist in the funding of and to identify priority services at which to target these resources. The database will be an essential tool in the delivery of effective services to people with physical and sensory disabilities in a planned and co-ordinated manner.</P>
    <P>The above issues relate to the many conditions which cause physical and sensory disabilities, including post-polio syndrome. It is not proposed to form a committee relating specifically to that condition. It is worth noting, however, that the Disability Federation of Ireland, of which the post-polio support group is a member, is represented at various forums, such as the national physical and sensory disability database committee and the review group on home support services.</P>

      <P>The provision of community audiology services is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Acts, hearing aids are provided free of charge to adult medical card holders over the age of 16 years who require them. Following the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board in June 2000, the responsibility for the provision of community audiology services throughout the regions was assigned initially to the Northern Area Health Board, NAHB, of the ERHA pending each health board taking over direct responsibility for the services within its own region. The service is currently managed from 44 North Great George's Street, Dublin 1, telephone (01) 8747726.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that the current average waiting time between referral and fitting with a hearing aid is approximately five months for adults. The service is being monitored by the general manager responsible for the community audiology service to ensure that services are at a satisfactory level and to identify early any gaps in services that may emerge. My Department has provided additional funding of &euro;0.461million in 2002 for the service. In addition, the health boards are <Col N="342" /> sponsoring the training of clinical staff for the community audiology service and this, coupled with the employment by the NAHB of additional sessional staff from Northern Ireland, will positively impact on service provision.</P>
    <P>Adults are treated in accordance with their medical need and their position on the waiting list. In addition, the NAHB operate a system of prioritisation in the case of children with certain medical conditions.</P>

      <P>My Department wrote to Mr. Paul Robinson, chief executive officer of the North-Eastern Health Board in his capacity as chairman of the Health Board Chief Executive Officers Group on the 24 of January, 2002 requesting that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare rates announced in the budget. In addition my Department again wrote to Mr. Robinson on 6 February, 2002 requesting that every effort be made to ensure that both medical card holders and applicants are made fully aware that increases in social welfare payments will not disadvantage them when applying to hold or retain a medical card. In response, the chief executive officers confirmed that social welfare recipients would not be disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>With regard to making staff aware of the chief executive officers' decision within health boards, this is an operational matter for the chief executive officers. Accordingly, I have had the matter referred to Mr. Donal O'Shea, regional chief executive officer of the ERHA asking him to reply to you directly on this matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002.</P>
      <P>Screening takes place at two static units in Dublin &ndash; the Eccles Unit and the Merrion Unit. In addition, to facilitate women living outside the Dublin area, there are three mobile units which travel to provide screening at a local level.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck has informed my Department that within the Midland Health Board area, screening has so far taken place in counties Longford and Westmeath, with counties Laois and Offaly scheduled for inclusion within the phase one screening round.</P>
      <P>I understand that up to September 2001, the programme has invited more than 51,000 women for screening of which more than 36,000 have responded. I further understand that in the Midland Health Board area alone, more than 6,500 women have been invited to date, of which more than 4,600 have availed of the opportunity for screening, representing an uptake of 69%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The substance of the letter referred to has been discussed with consultant orthodontists and the question at issue was also discussed as part of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children's examination of the orthodontic service. Its report is a very comprehensive document and contains 32 wide ranging recommendations that are being considered as a matter of priority by my Department and the health boards.</P>
      <P>My Department, in its submission to the joint committee, acknowledged that the extent of the waiting list and waiting time for orthodontic assessment and treatment is unacceptable and is a matter of serious concern. The prevailing situation is compounded by the fact that orthodontic services are restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. This shortage has resulted from, amongst other things, divisions within the orthodontic community that have triggered difficulties and resistance in agreeing arrangements for training programmes. I note that the joint committee has recognised the divisions within the profession and their impact on the extent of the waiting list and time for orthodontic assessment and treatment. In addition, the committee identified enhanced training opportunities as an important element in improved delivery of orthodontic services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties in agreeing training programmes in a minority of health board areas, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that there has been significant progress in this area. In October last year, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way. My Department has funded the appointment of a director <Col N="350" /> of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a Professor in Orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, namely, the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The Dental Council has already established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics. In addition, agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the introduction of the grade of specialist in orthodontics into the public service. This agreement resulted from complex and time consuming negotiations and its introduction will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics.</P>
    <P>The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment. In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. An additional six-surgery facility and five-surgery facility at the Loughlinstown Regional Orthodontic Unit and the St. James's Hospital Regional Orthodontic Unit respectively have also been developed under the initiative. My Department is exploring with boards every possibility to expand the level of services in the short-term such as the use of private specialist orthodontic practitioners and the treatment of patients in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>The measures that I have taken have already positively impacted on the orthodontic services. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the above measures continue to take effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, there are no proposals to extend automatic eligibility to medical cards to people affected by Huntingdon's disease. However, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness &ndash; for persons under 16 years only &ndash; phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to extend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with Huntingdon's disease. Non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <Quest>if he has reached a decision as to the way in which, and when, persons who paid £42 on the drugs refund scheme, when they should correctly have paid £32, will be reimbursed; and the details of such a decision in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The drugs payment scheme was introduced with effect from 1 July 1999. The new scheme essentially amalgamated the existing drug cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes and provided that families would only have to meet the first &euro;53.33, £42, per month of expenditure on approved prescribed medicines. The existing threshold for the DCSS scheme was &euro;40.63, £32, per month per individual and for the DRS it was &euro;114.28, £90, per calendar quarter for each eligible person and his or her dependants. In the case of the DRS the person had to pay the purchase price of the drugs to the pharmacist and claim a refund from the appropriate health board at the end of the quarter.</P>
      <P>The new drugs payments scheme was designed to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes, to be more user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. The scheme was also designed to iron out anomalies whereby, for example, a person or family who might spend &euro;101.58, £80, in one month on medicines and have no expenditure for the remainder of the quarter would not be entitled to any refund. Accordingly under this new scheme families are able to budget for the cost of prescribed medicines. Regardless of the cost of their prescribed medicines, families are liable only for a maximum of &euro;53.33, £42, in any month. A further advantage is that applicants are not required to pay and claim a refund as in the previous schemes. In addition there are no qualifying criteria for the DPS unlike the previous DCSS where a person had to have a certificate from a doctor and be approved by a health board as having a long-term medical condition requiring regular and continuous prescribed drugs in excess of &euro;40.63, £32, per month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial benefits of the new DPS are reflected in the significantly increased spending <Col N="355" /> level relative to the earlier schemes it replaced. The total cost of the DPS and the DCSS in 1998 &ndash; the last full year of operation &ndash; was £74.69 million. In contrast the new DPS cost £110 million in 2000 &ndash; the first full year of operation &ndash; and rose to £140 million in 2001. The aggregate benefits of the new scheme are clearly significantly greater than the previous schemes. The DPS was initially introduced on an administrative basis with the intention that regulations to underpin the operation of the new scheme would be introduced in due course. There were some legal precedents for this. Following further detailed consideration, the regulations were introduced in February 2001, putting the new scheme on a statutory basis. Given that claimants overall derived greater benefit from the new scheme, as reflected in the significant increase in spending on the new scheme, the question of possible refunds was not addressed when the regulations were being put in place. This question is now being re-examined and I am awaiting further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in its area is a matter for South Tipperary County Council to be funded from its own resources and supplemented by State grants. Since 1997, non-national road grants to South Tipperary County Council have increased by almost 80%. The &euro;9,489,428 allocation for 2002 represents an increase of over 8% on the corresponding 2001 initial allocation of &euro;8,763,732. The county council's 2002 discretionary improvement and maintenance grants of &euro;637,000 and &euro;754,000 have also increased significantly from &euro;585,000 and &euro;692,000 in 2001, increases of approximately 9% in each category.</P>
      <P>Funding under the local improvements scheme has also increased significantly in recent years. The total allocation to county councils in 2002 is &euro;11.208 million, which is an increase of 194% on the 1997 allocation of &euro;3,809,000 and 10% on the 2001 allocation of &euro;10.158 million. South Tipperary County Council's share of this allocation is &euro;103,995, which represents increases of 64% and 13% on its 1997 and 2001 allocations respectively. Non-national road grants for 2002, including the local improvements scheme, have now been fully allocated and there are no further funds available to allow for any additional grants over and above those already allocated in the current year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="360" />The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, projected investment of &euro;825 million in waste management infrastructure and anticipated that up to &euro;570 million of this investment could be secured through public private partnership arrangements availing of private finance. It is not possible at this stage to indicate the final outturn over the life of the plan. The grants scheme announced in March 2002 is intended primarily to support the provision of &ldquo;high in waste hierarchy&rdquo; waste recovery infrastructure, which is provided for, or consistent with, the objectives of local authority waste management plans. Eligible recovery infrastructure would include civic amenity sites and other &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities, transfer stations and materials recovery and biological treatment facilities. Assistance will also be available to support the provision of hazardous waste landfill capacity, the need for which is identified in the national hazardous waste management plan. However, grant assistance will not be provided in respect of the capital cost of thermal treatment or non-hazardous landfill infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The deadline for the receipt of the first round of grant applications is 31 May 2002. Accordingly, I am not in a position at this time to indicate who will receive grant assistance, or to anticipate the likely breakdown of allocations between different waste technologies and management options.</P>

      <P>My Department published guidelines for planning authorities on wind farm development in September 1996. The guidelines, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, identify relevant planning and land use issues to which planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála should have regard in formulating development plans and in considering an application for planning permission or an appeal for a wind farm. These guidelines now have a statutory status as ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, to which planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard in the performance of their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strategy for intensifying wind energy deployment was published by the Department of Public Enterprise in July 2000. Its aim is to support the delivery of additional electricity generating capacity from renewable sources, mainly wind, as set out in the Green Paper on sustainable energy and the national climate change strategy. A letter to each county manager and each county council <Col N="361" /> chairman was issued jointly by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise in March 2001. This referred to the strategy's specific recommendations to reduce obstacles to the increased deployment of renewable energy technologies in electricity production, including issues in relation to planning. The letter also pointed out the recommendation of the strategy that four distinct categories of areas could be identified on a local, regional or national basis and eventually be incorporated into each local authority's development plan.</P>
    <P>I refer also to the reply to Question No. 496 of 20 March 2002, in which I said I met with representatives of the Irish Wind Energy Association and Meitheal na Gaoithe &ndash; the Irish wind farmers association &ndash; on 7 February 2002 to discuss their concerns in relation to the future development of the wind energy industry in Ireland. I invited Meitheal na Gaoithe to make a full written submission to my Department outlining its particular concerns and setting out any detailed textual amendments it would like to see included in a revised edition of the guidelines. This submission is awaited.</P>

      <P>The compilation and publication of the register of electors is a matter for each registration authority in accordance with electoral law. Register details are updated in preparation for the publication of the draft register on 1 November each year. As part of this process authorities are required to send a notice to a person whose name it is proposed to omit from the draft register indicating that they have failed to establish that the person is still resident at the address and that, unless evidence to the contrary is provided within ten days, their name will be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person may claim to have a correction made to the draft register following its publication. The claim must be made to the registration authority by 25 November and it may include, in particular, a claim to have the name of a person added or deleted. Such claims are ruled on in public by the appropriate county registrar and interested parties must be given notice of the time and location of the proposed hearing. An appeal may be made in the Circuit Court against the decision of a county registrar. When the final register comes into force, a person's name can only be removed if they have <Col N="362" /> applied successfully for entry on the supplement to the register as a result of a change of residence, which can be in the constituency or in another constituency. In such cases, the person's name on the register in respect of their previous address is deleted and they are registered at their new address.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities. Stringent quality standards are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1998. The duty placed on sanitary authorities to ensure that drinking water meets these standards is performed by the authorities under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. Information in relation to drinking water supplies in County Roscommon is contained in the EPA report &ldquo;The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland 1998-2000&rdquo;, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. More detailed information may be available on request directly from Roscommon County Council and the EPA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strokestown is currently supplied by the north east Roscommon regional water supply scheme. I have allocated funding in my Department's water services investment programme to allow substantial improvement works to commence on this scheme next year. I approved a brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare contract documents for the scheme in February 2000. Approval issued in January 2002 to Roscommon County Council's proposal to extend the consultant's brief to include an assessment of alternative surface and groundwater sources for the scheme. Monksland, Athlone is currently supplied by the south Roscommon regional water supply scheme. I have also approved upgrading works for this <Col N="363" /> scheme, and this will allow Roscommon County Council to commence the relevant planning.</P>

      <P>I refer to Part VI of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and the Environmental Protection Agency Act (Noise) Regulations, 1994, which provide local authorities with powers to prevent or limit noise from any premises. In addition, section 34 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that a planning authority may attach specific conditions in respect of noise to a grant of permission for development. In so far as noise in the workplace and the protection of workers is concerned, the European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Noise) Regulations, 1990, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the assessment and measurement of noise experienced at work, the identification of areas where noise exceeds specified levels and for the maintenance of records of noise levels. Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the Health and Safety Authority and its programme of work for 2002 includes workplace inspections in places of entertainment. I have no proposals to specify maximum limits of noise levels in this context.</P>

I have already consented to some elements of the scheme proceeding as advance works and Mayo County Council's tender report and recommendation for sewer rehabilitation is being examined in my Department. Additional information recently received from the council in relation to a further proposed advance section involving an extension of the outfall for the scheme to a point downstream of the Castlebar and Manulla rivers, is also under consideration in my Department.

      <P>A preliminary report for Lahardane sewerage scheme was submitted to my Department by Mayo County Coun<Col N="369" /> cil in 1996 but has not been approved. The scheme was nineteenth in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2002-2004, announced this week. Given the priority afforded the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme. However, the council is considering proceeding with the scheme under the devolved small schemes programme, which is part funded by my Department.</P>

      <P>On the general issues raised in the correspondence regarding road traffic controls in relation to heavy goods vehicles, the position is as follows. The maximum speed limit for heavy goods vehicles in any case is 50 mph, or less than this where the road speed limit is lower. A speed limit of 30 mph applies to roads in built up areas generally and special speed limits of 40 mph and 50 mph may be applied on selective basis by local authorities. The Road Traffic Act, 2002, provides both for the introduction of a new system of penalty points, which will apply to all of the offences referred to in the correspondence, and for a comprehensive updating of all financial penalties applicable to traffic offences generally. The enforcement of traffic offences is a matter for the Garda.</P>

Under the public library capital expenditure programme, 2002-2004, grant-aid of &euro;31,840,000 has been approved for public library projects. The capital grant may include site costs. These projects were approved for funding mainly on the basis of prioritised lists of library projects submitted to my Department by each library authority. As no application has been received from Dublin City Council for a library at Drimnagh, it is not included in the current programme.</P>

The payments in these cases amounted to &euro;34.35 million in respect of treatment provided to 433,000 people who qualified for treatment under the scheme. This works out at an average payment of &euro;30,780 per dentist. The level of payments to individual dentists under the scheme varies widely as shown in the following table:</P>

    <P>Of the treatments carried out under the scheme, 46% were free of charge to the patient and 44% were subject to additional patient charges at fixed rates. These charges produced an additional &euro;13 million in payments under the scheme. Of treatments, 10% were subject to additional patient charges which are not fixed. Apart from their incomes from my Department's dental benefit scheme, most dentists will also receive payments for the treatment of medical card patients under the dental treatment services scheme operated by the health boards. Total payments under that scheme amounted to &euro;41 million last year paid to some 1200 dentists, which works out at an average payment per dentist of &euro;34,000.</P>
    <P>As private practitioners, dentists also undertake levels of treatment on a private basis for patients not covered by either of these schemes. The amounts paid under my Department's scheme to individual dentists for each dental practice in the year 2001 are shown in the table which has been forwarded to the Deputy. The amounts are shown in punts, the currency of payment.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of long-term funding programmes, the purpose of which is to provide core funding for groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities. The funding provided for the community development support programmes in 2002 amounts to some &euro;27.65 million. In general, core funding provided under my Department's community development support programmes provides for the employment of a maximum of two full-time staff equivalent, together with the administration and general operating costs of the project. In the 1998 budget, an allocation of £300,000, &euro;380,921, was made available for projects funded under the community development programme, specifically to apply for additional time limited funding for work. This was usually to cover the employment costs of a worker necessary to the effectiveness of the programme but not otherwise resourced at that time. This enhanced funding scheme operated from 1998 to 2000 during which time a total of &euro;4.475 million, including commitments for 2001 to 2002 has been committed to projects. Funding for an outreach worker was approved for a forum in 2000 for three years and the enhanced funding commitment does not expire until 2003. I assure the Deputy that this commitment will be met.</P>
      <P>Pending a review, no new applications for funding or applications for continued funding of existing posts under the enhanced funding scheme were invited in 2001. This review has been completed and is currently under consideration by my Department. While a decision regarding the future operation of the scheme has yet to be determined, I emphasise again that all existing funding commitments will be honoured.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 476 and 477 together.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work. A person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an ongoing basis is not entitled to an unemployment payment. It is accepted that periods of unemployment are a normal feature of the dancing and choreography professions and people in those professions can qualify for payment when they are out of work. Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment, provided there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature. However, in situations where it is clear that there is no employment available in a specialised field within a reasonable period, the unemployed person is expected to broaden his or her search to include other types of employment. The application of these conditions is the same for members of the artistic professions as for other claimants for unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision to refuse him or her an unemployment payment, he or she may appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme, including a reduction in the average number of yearly contributions required for a minimum pension to ten, the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for those with mixed rate insurance records and the special pension for those with pre-1953 insurance contributions. These measures are of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after children, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>Where a person qualifies for a reduced rate pension, it is possible for them to opt for a payment as a qualified adult on their spouse's or partner's pension if that would be more beneficial for the household income. The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 and allows for periods spent out of the workforce caring for children or sick relatives to be disregarded when a person's contribution record is being averaged for pension purposes. This scheme is at present being reviewed as part of an overall review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension, the first phase of which was published in August 2000. It is expected that the phase 2 report will be finalised shortly. Changes to the homemaker's scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of the phase 2 report, the overall costs involved and the resources available for future budget improvements.</P>
      <P>Other work under way in this area includes the report of the PPF working group on administrative individualisation, which is currently examining the issues of administrative individualisation. Following consideration of this report, it is hoped that arrangements can be put in place so that as many qualified adults as possible can receive their payments directly. As announced in last year's budget, I intend to increase the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. This process commenced in budget 2000 with special increases of &euro;19.05 granted. In budget 2002 increases of up to &euro;12.70 were granted to qualified adults over 66 years of age.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which, to the end of 2000, has assisted some 80,482 individuals. In 2002 &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme.</P>
      <P>Voluntary or community based groups seeking funding under the scheme of community support for older people must satisfy the defined eligibility criteria of the scheme, comply with Government tax clearance procedures and provide satisfactory accounts in respect of previously paid grants. An application for funding was received from the organisation mentioned in the Deputy's question in 2000 and again in 2001. However, as satisfactory accounts and other documentation were not submitted to my Department in respect of the grant issued in 1999, it was not possible to process the application further. My Department has been engaged in lengthy correspondence with the group on this matter and has now received the outstanding accounts. However, other documentation is currently outstanding. It is hoped to resolve this matter shortly. My officials will be in touch with the organisation in due course.</P>

He is also in receipt of a fuel allowance of &euro;9.00. On the basis of the information available, he is also entitled to an additional dependent child allowance increase of &euro;19.30 per week. Payment of the allowance will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 482 to 484, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a number of long-term funding programmes which are collectively referred to as the community development support programme. It includes the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme, the programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups. The purpose of these programmes is to provide seed money to enable locally based community groups to pilot initiatives in relation to poverty and disadvantage. Each project is currently funded on a three year renewable contract basis. There are no plans currently to extend the contract period from three to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the strategic management initiative, the Department has an obligation to carry out an expenditure review on the community development programme. In order to inform this review and to gather baseline data on which to base the review, in 1999 the Department commissioned Nexus Research Co-operative with Farrell Grant Sparks limited to evaluate the social impact of the community development programme. This review <Col N="381" /> was completed in late 2000. While the actual research has not been published, work on the evaluation has not been in abeyance. The evaluation model proposed in the report is currently being piloted by projects and the support agency in the western region and by three other support agencies. The final results of these pilots will be available shortly for consideration. It is envisaged that the research, in conjunction with the outcome of the pilot work in the western region, will be published in due course.</P>
    <P>In general, core funding provided under my Department's community development support programmes provides for the employment of a maximum of two full-time staff equivalent together with the administration and general operating costs of the project. In the 1998 budget, an allocation of £300,000 was made available for projects funded under the community development programme, specifically to apply for additional time limited funding for work. This was usually to cover the employment costs of a worker necessary to the effectiveness of the programme but not otherwise resourced at that time. This enhanced funding scheme operated from 1998 to 2000. In 2001 a review of the scheme was initiated. This review, which addressed a number of issues including the mainstreaming of certain posts, has now been completed and is currently under consideration by my Department.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension of &euro;19.00 per week. This payment is based on her means as assessed in November 2001 of &euro;124.43, £98.00, deriving from her British pension and from a holding. Following the transfer of her holding to her sons in December 2001, her means decreased to &euro;103.91, £81.84 per week. As a consequence, her pension increased to &euro;26.30, £19.50, per week with effect from 21 December 2001. This has been further increased to &euro;39.00 per week from 4 January 2002 due to the budget increases in payment rates. The pension book of the person concerned has recently been recalled by my Department. This will be replaced by a new book payable from 19 April 2002 at the higher rate. Arrears of pension due to her for the period from 21 December 2001 to 18 April 2002 will be issued shortly thereafter.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which, to the end of 2000, has assisted some 80,482 individuals. A sum of &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, grants for the following equipment are provided for: small-scale physical security equipment such as, strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and door locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarms systems, such as the panic button pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated via the telephone. An independent review of the scheme was completed in 1999 and there are no plans to amend its terms. Funding is not available under the scheme for provision of emergency lighting units to cover power failures as indicated in the Deputy's question. My Department's scheme is specifically designed to provide funding to improve the security and social support of older people as detailed above. The supply of electricity is the responsibility of the Department of Public Enterprise which formulates high-level policy for the energy sector. My Department has recently contacted that Department in relation to the specific problem the Deputy has raised in relation to electricity supply in north Mayo.</P>

      <P>A claim for old age non-contributory pension from the person's spouse was disallowed on the grounds that her means, derived from his occupational pension, were above the limit for entitlement to a pension. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers. I have no role in making such decisions. Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned questioning the logic and rationale of the underlying legislation governing the means test and indicated that the person wished to appeal the decision. The Social Welfare Appeals Office indicated in a reply to these representations on 5 October 2001 that if, following an explanation of the underlying legislation, the person wished to have the claim referred to an appeals officer for consideration this would be arranged. A full reply to the person making the representations, dealing with the general policy and legislative issues raised, was issued from my office on 18 October. No further communication was received. If the person concerned wishes to pursue an appeal he should contact the Social Welfare Appeals office.</P>
      <P>Means tested schemes are an important part of the social welfare system as they provide basic payments for people who do not have the necessary social insurance to qualify for contributory payments but who can satisfy a means test. The schemes are designed and intended to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need. In the case of couples where one or both are claiming a social assistance payment the overall means of the household are counted to determine each individual's means. In the case of old age non-contributory pension this is done through rule 4(a) of Part II of the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare Act, 1983, which provides that &ldquo;the means of the person shall be taken to be one half of the total means of the couple&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, the household means are derived from the pension of the person concerned which results in an income assessment of &euro;317.78 per week on the claim of his spouse. This is considerably in excess of the means threshold of &euro;124.43 <Col N="384" /> per week which would give entitlement to a pension at the minimum rate. In order that the person's spouse could receive a pension, it would be necessary to introduce means testing on an individual basis without regard to the overall household income. Such a system would be extremely costly and would neither be in keeping with the overall objective of the assistance system nor with the aims of the programme for prosperity and fairness which sees individualisation of the social welfare system being progressed in the context of a continuation of joint assessment of means. Overall policy in this area has been to extend social insurance coverage to as many people and groups as possible so that people can establish their own individual records and receive payments in their own right. In addition, the qualifying conditions for old age contributory pensions have been eased considerably to make it easier for those with reduced or broken insurance records to receive an individual payment.</P>

      <P>Since 1996 my Department has operated a scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Funding is provided through grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations which have undertaken to identify elderly people in need of assistance. Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated under the scheme, which had assisted 80,482 individuals by the end of 2000 and &euro;4.4 million has been provided in 2002. The 2002 scheme of grants will be advertised extensively in the national and provincial newspapers in the near future. While a closing date for receipt of applications is applied each year, departmental regional offices are flexible in accepting late applications, as their prime concern is the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>
      <P>Although details of grants paid by my Department since 1996 are available in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members, the details are, in the main, listed by region rather than by county. Details of the grants made by my Department in 2001 are being finalised and will be made available in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntary or community based organisations <Col N="385" /> working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may apply for grant aid. Individuals who wish to obtain information on how they, or older people known to them, can obtain assistance under the scheme should contact a local representative of the organisations involved in the scheme, such as Muintir na Tíre, neighbourhood watch, community alert or any other group involved in the scheme in their local area. Members of staff in the Dublin north regional office of my Department continually assist groups wishing to apply for funding on behalf of elderly persons. They are currently liaising with two groups in the Finglas area who have indicated that they are interested in applying for funding under the scheme in 2002.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, grants are provided for small scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks, security lighting and socially monitored alarm systems such as the panic button pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated via a telephone. The Department does not endorse or recommend any specific product as it is a matter for voluntary organisations applying for funding under the scheme to decide which products to avail of from commercial companies.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his or her needs. The scheme is administered by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. The allowance is subject to a means test; rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a household, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to family circumstances, less &euro;7.62, which represents the minimum contribution recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;7.62 towards their rent because they are required to contribute additional assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent. The value of maintenance payments must be considered in the means test for one-parent family payment and rent supplement in the case of a single mother who receives maintenance payments as well as the other two payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Half the maintenance payment is disregarded under the means test for the one-parent family payment. If a recipient has housing costs to meet, however, maintenance of up to &euro;95.23 per week is disregarded. If maintenance of more than &euro;95.23 per week is paid, half the amount above &euro;95.23 per week is disregarded and the balance is assessed and a lower rate of one-parent family payment may be paid. A lone parent in receipt of maintenance payments and seeking a rent supplement, with rent costs because the maintenance payment does not meet housing costs in full, can apply for supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement. In such a case, rent for rent supplement purposes is the net amount of rent paid <Col N="387" /> from his or her own resources, that is that part of the total rent met after taking into account the value of the maintenance payment. If maintenance of more than &euro;95.23 per week is paid, the first &euro;50 per week of net additional income, having regard to any reduction in one-parent family payment, is not taken into account in the means test for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>In this way, the maintenance payment is consistently treated in the means tests for one-parent family payment and rent supplement. The maintenance payment is not regarded as income for the purposes of the one-parent family payment because it goes towards rent and equally, the rent for rent supplement purposes is the net rent after maintenance is paid. A review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is currently under way as part of my Department's formal programme evaluation studies. The review will examine all aspects of the scheme including the manner in which maintenance payments are assessed in the calculation of rent supplements.</P>

The scheme, which was recently adver<Col N="388" /> tised in the national newspapers, will operate as usual this year between 1 June and 30 September, during which period students can undertake up to 200 hours work at &euro;3.85 per hour. An extra &euro;1.30 per hour is paid to students whose parents are solely dependent on social welfare payments. The scheme is designed to support the students concerned and not primarily to fill all the community jobs which might be done. Furthermore, it is not designed to compete with jobs available on the open market and in fact, any diversion of employable workers from commercial employment could have a negative impact on seasonal industries which are dependent on student participation. The rates of payment and other conditions of the scheme are fixed for the current year and there are no plans to alter them.</P>

      <P>The person concerned received reduced rate carer's allowance until 24 July 2001. Following a review of her entitlement, she was disallowed carer's allowance as her weekly means derived from her spouse's earnings exceeded the statutory limit. She appealed the decision and an appeals officer upheld the original decision. The decision of an appeals officer is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence. In this year's budget, provision was made for further improvements in the carer's allowance means test. The income disregard for single carer's allowance increased to &euro;191 and the disregard for couples increased to &euro;382 from April 2002. Arising from these improvements, her case is being reviewed and she has been requested to submit details of her husband's earnings. Her case will be re-examined on receipt of this information and she will be notified of the outcome. Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. The officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.</P>

      <P>At the request of my Department, Galway County Council appointed the consultants referred to by the Deputy to prepare a preliminary report on the development of Caladh Mór pier on Inis Meáin. The report has been received by my Department and the case for the development of the pier is being evaluated in the context of funding available to me for island development and other matters. As part of this evaluation process, my Department requested the consultants to provide a fee proposal for a wave analysis study on the implications for the use of the other pier on the island at Cora Point if rock armour was constructed at that facility. The fee proposal has been received from the consultants and is being examined by my officials. Following a full evaluation of both proposals, a decision on the pier facilities will be made.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question deals, <i>inter alia</i>, with the recognition of dance and choreography as an art form in its own right. I wish to inform him that the Arts Bill, published on 10 April, proposes that &ldquo;arts&rdquo; be defined as &ldquo;any creative or interpretative expression (whether traditional or contemporary) in whatever form, and includes, in particular, visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, film and architecture, and includes any medium when used for those purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>State support for the arts is channelled through the Arts Council, which is autonomous in the allocation of its resources. The Arts Plan 2002-2006 prepared by the Arts Council and recently endorsed by the Government identifies as a priority the promotion of dance as a vibrant and enjoyable art form. The Deputy may wish to note that any queries relating to tax exemptions for artists should be addressed to the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance. The question of the amendment of legislation on tax exemption is a matter for Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The role of my Department as regards the Lucan Demesne has been confined largely to acquiring the property and transferring individual parcels of land to each of the three local authorities concerned. It is intended that a Liffey valley park be established, to be owned and managed on a co-operative basis <Col N="392" /> by the three authorities on the basis of an agreed management plan. My Department secured development funding for the park amounting to &euro;4.762 million over a five year period to facilitate this.</P>
      <P>The Lucan Demesne was acquired by my Department in the summer of 1996. While execution of legal formalities by two of the local authorities is outstanding, ongoing management and maintenance of the demesne is dealt with directly by each of the local authorities involved. South Dublin County Council signed up to the legal transfer of the lands at an early date but, as advised previously, both Fingal County Council and Kildare County Council have not honoured the commitments made in 1996. The management plan for the park was agreed by the three local authorities and my Department in December 1998 but until the legal transfer of the lands has been completed by all parties, it is not possible to commence the release of funding as provided for under the management plan. The specific query raised by the Deputy refers to the area of the park managed by Fingal County Council and consequently the matter should be taken up directly with that authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 515 and 516 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2001, total capital expenditure at Portumna <Col N="396" /> Castle in 2001 amounted to &euro;45,087, current expenditure amounted to &euro;96,500 and the cost of providing a guide service at the site was &euro;53,965. Provisional visitor statistics show that there were 10,729 visitors to Portumna Castle in 2001, but figures are not yet available for the number of people who visited the site through the Dúchas heritage card scheme. Portumna Castle reopened for this year's visitor season on 1 April and revenue accrued to date in 2002 at the site is not yet available. The figure of &euro;3,948,263 stated in my reply to Questions Nos. 203 to 205, inclusive, of 27 March relates to capital expenditure at the castle between 1990 and 2001 and does not include expenditure between 1968 and 1989. In this regard, I refer the Deputy to my response to Questions Nos. 237 to 240, inclusive, of 8 May 2001 in which I advised that as only work of a routine maintenance nature was undertaken between 1968 and 1989 expenditure details for this period are unavailable.</P>

      <P>An outbreak of fire on 9 and 10 April destroyed over 400 hectares of moorland as well as fringes of some of the oldest pockets of native woodland on the western side of Killarney National Park. The location is a very remote area of the park, in difficult and dangerous terrain, which made it difficult to access for the purposes of fighting the blaze. It is not possible to estimate the number and species of birds that might have been lost. While the nests of species such as wheatears, stonechats, meadow pipits, snipe, red grouse, woodcock and peregrine falcon may have been lost in the fire, it is considered unlikely that nesting birds were present because of the time of year. I understand that the terrain in question is not suitable as a habitat for pheasants and partridges. In view of a recent spate of fire outbreaks in Killarney National Park, Dúchas has asked the local Garda to investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>The mother and daughter in question are aged 84 years and 51 years, respectively. They are Australian citizens, have rights of residence in Australia and have lived in Australia for most of their lives. The daughter previously lived in Ireland for two years until 15 years ago. The mother is an Irish citizen by descent, her grandfather having been born in Ireland, and therefore has rights of residence in Ireland. The mother and daughter had been in Canada on visitors' visas and Australian passports but overstayed the duration of their permission to remain. They sought permission, with the assistance of an immigration lawyer, to reside in Canada on the basis that the mother's medical condition rendered it impossible for her to travel and that they had become established there.</P>
      <P>The application was turned down and the Canadian immigration authorities obtained a medical opinion from two specialists indicating that the mother was in a position to travel. The daughter was deported to Australia. My understanding is that the Canadian authorities intended to make arrangements for the deportation of the mother to Australia. In the event the mother, being an Irish citizen also, was deported to Ireland at the request of her daughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, a senior official in the immigration and citizenship division of my Department was contacted by the Australian Embassy to establish whether the daughter would be admitted to Ireland for a month to visit her mother, with a view to facilitating her mother's return to Australia. Notwithstanding her previous <Col N="399" /> immigration history in Canada, this request was acceded to and the Australian Embassy was asked to notify my Department of her flight details to ensure the immigration authorities at Dublin Airport would be informed in advance to obviate any potential difficulties upon her arrival. The embassy contacted an official in my Department with a view to correcting information previously supplied. It stated it was now aware that the daughter intended to overstay the agreed period and did not have sufficient funds to reschedule an airline ticket which she had already purchased. The official was aware that the daughter had expressed an interest in moving to Ireland permanently and, consequently, the previous commitment given by my Department was revoked.</P>
    <P>No independent evidence, such as a bank statement, has been supplied to my Department to show that the daughter is in a position to support herself and her mother in this jurisdiction without recourse to public funds. Her intention seems to be to seek employment here although she has neither a job offer nor a work permit obtained by an employer on her behalf. It should be noted that it is a principle of immigration control worldwide that persons wishing to reside in another jurisdiction must be in a position to show, prior to obtaining leave to land, that they are in a position to support themselves and their dependants without recourse to public funds.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been assigned the lead role in the development and co-ordination of child care services over the course of the national development plan. In this regard, the equal opportunities childcare programme, which is funded by both the European Union and the Exchequer, provides grant assistance to community based and not for profit organisations and private child care providers who meet the criteria set out in the programme. In September 2001, I approved a capital grant of &euro;30,019 to Muckalee community playgroup, to assist the group to develop a facility with an outdoor play area. The next step in the process involves the completion of a contract by the group, which is administered on my Department's behalf by Area Development Management Limited. I have been informed by the childcare directorate of my Department that ADM has finalised the contract and expects to be in a position to complete the necessary formalities with the group shortly. Payment of the grant will <Col N="400" /> begin shortly after a signed contract from the group is received by ADM.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medical Organisation has lodged a claim with the Prisons Service for a review of pay and conditions applicable under the terms of the prison medical officer common contract and negotiations in this regard are ongoing. I would be very concerned at a refusal to implement the computerisation of medical records. The Prisons Service has sought <Col N="401" /> clarification of the position from the IMO and I do not wish to comment further until such clarification has been received.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been assigned the lead role in the development and co-ordination of child care services over the course of the national development plan. In this regard, the equal opportunities childcare programme, which is funded by both the European Union and the Exchequer, provides grant assistance to community based and not for profit organisations and private child care providers who meet the criteria set out in the programme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the playgroup referred to by the Deputy, I have been informed by the childcare directorate of my Department that an application was received in July 2001 from the playgroup for a staffing grant. Staffing grants are available to community based and not for profit organisations which operate in areas of disadvantage or which have a particular focus on tackling disadvantage within their area. The application underwent the usual assessment and appraisal process. In particular, a technical assessment of the proposal carried out by ADM Limited was referred to the programme appraisal committee.</P>
      <P>On foot of the assessment by ADM and the recommendation of the appraisal committee, I regret that I was not in a position to approve this application. While the programme appraisal committee recognised the valuable service offered by the playgroup, it held that the proposal did not fall within the scope of the equal opportunities childcare programme because it did not meet the core objectives of the programme in terms of the hours of operation and seemed to have a very limited focus in terms of addressing disadvantage. I understand from officials of my Department's childcare directorate that an appeal in relation to the decision was lodged on 24 January 2002. The appeal is being processed and, in the interim, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>While it is not usual practice for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report to the House on the progress of individual Garda investigations, sufficient details of this case are already in the public arena for me to state that in 1996 the investigation into this matter was reviewed by the Garda Síochána in conjunction with the then RUC. Four suspects were arrested and interviewed outside the State and a file was subsequently submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions of Northern Ireland. Having examined the evidence in the matter he directed that no proceedings should be instituted against any of the persons concerned. However, the Garda authorities assure me that their investigation file remains open in this case and that any developments will be fully pursued.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided in principle in September 1999 to establish an inquiry into this case as well as bombings in Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk. Mr. Justice Barron agreed in December last to undertake the inquiry, to be carried out on the same basis as that into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, in line with the recommendations contained in the report of the Victims Commission. It is understood that Mr. Justice Barron recently met the legal representatives of the victim's relatives to discuss how matters may be progressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has responsibility for leading the development of child care services in Ireland. My Department's equal opportunities childcare pro<Col N="403" /> gramme has been allocated EU and Exchequer funding of &euro;437 million through the national development plan to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country. This represents the most significant investment in childcare by any Government in the history of the State and is targeted at services which offer day care facilities and services for pre-school children and school-going children out of school hours.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the matter of expediting the approval of applications for funding with Area Development Management Limited, which administers the programme on behalf of my Department. I am aware that while the aim is to process applications within three months, they may take somewhat longer to process in some instances as a result of the volume of applications for funding which are being submitted. I am advised by ADM that since the launch of the programme in July 2000, 2,100 applications have been received. Of these, 1,443 have been fully processed and almost &euro;117 million in funding has been committed under the equal opportunities programme in the form of capital or staffing grants to child care services on the ground, as well as funding to the national voluntary child care organisations. The applications approved to date will support over 30,000 child care places including the creation of over 13,700 new child care places.</P>
      <P>I understand from ADM that just over 100 applications have been placed on hold at the request of the applicants and that a final decision will be taken on a further 70 projects within a week or so. Of the 470 active applications still on hand, 253 have been submitted within the last three months. I have been informed by ADM that it anticipates that the recent recruitment of three replacement staff will further expedite the throughput of applications to decision. The Deputy will understand that to address the childcare needs of the county, it is vital that funding is invested in quality child care services. Any childcare service that receives funding under the equal opportunities childcare programme must be of the highest standard and be sustainable. As the Deputy will appreciate, when committing public moneys to projects it is incumbent that we take every reasonable step to ensure that applications for funding comply with the relevant rules and regulations, such as EU regulations on grant aid under the Structural Funds, and that the recommendations made to myself have been properly evaluated under the criteria of the grant schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Deputy's information, I will outline the procedure involved in processing an application received under the equal opportunities childcare programme. Once an application is logged and an acknowledgement letter issued by my officials, the application is forwarded to ADM Limited, which acts on behalf of my Department in assessing each application. During the consultation process, the details of the project, including the costings of the work, are confirmed by ADM <Col N="404" /> with the applicant. Site visits may also take place, particularly with large capital projects or applications under the staffing grant scheme. Large capital projects are assessed by an external specialist and assessments are subject to quality assurance procedures. The county childcare committee, established to advance the development of child care at a local level, are also consulted during the assessment stage. Once the appraisal process is complete, the assessment is submitted to the programme appraisal committee which makes a recommendation to me for a final decision.</P>
    <P>To give each application a full and fair assessment, it is necessary for applicants to give information relating to their child care services. The assessment of applications is based on material supplied by the applicant under the following criteria: the socio-economic profile of the area relating to the application; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the applicants to implement the project; the level of integration and co-ordination and the costings or value for money of the proposal. Departmental officials continue to work closely with the management of ADM Limited to identify logjams and to ensure that applications for funding are processed as speedily as possible.</P>

I am sure the Deputy will understand that at this stage it would be premature of me to comment any further on this particular matter.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to say that difficulties in relation to delays experienced by non-EEA national customers at the Garda National Immigration Bureau's immigration registration office in Harcourt Square have been resolved. Following successful negotiations with relevant trade unions, a shift system has been introduced and since 19 March new extended opening hours have been in operation. The immigration registration office's new hours are between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Friday and between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The net effect of the extended opening hours is that any person who presents at the office at any time on a given day has a guarantee that he or she will be dealt with and there is no necessity for persons to queue prior to opening time. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, with a view to maintaining this level of service, the Office of Public Works has purchased new and far larger accommodation for the office, which will be ready for occupation later this year. It is intended that the new accommodation will provide a one stop shop for legally resident non-nationals in the Dublin area, as it will also accommodate the immigration and citizenship division of my Department, together with the visa office of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536 and 542 together.</P>
      <P>The Revised Estimates published on 28 February 2002 provides that the grant payable to the Human Rights Commission under subhead B1 of Vote 19 for the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for this year is &euro;1,292,000. The corresponding figure for last year was &euro;1,270,000, of which &euro;278,000 was expended by the commission. The grants to the commission and its expenditure to date reflect the fact that it is still in its initial stage of operation. In my reply to Question No. 404 of 26 March, I referred to the fact that the commission is on the point of appointing its chief executive. Once the process is completed, arrangements regarding its staffing structure and its permanent staffing complement will be finalised. It will then be possible to determine its full operating and financial requirements in accordance with its statutory role and remit. The commission has two temporary staff to assist it during this start up phase. The European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil, provides for the giving of further effect to the provisions of the convention in Irish law. The Bill proposes that its provisions will come into effect not later than six months after the date of its passing as the Minister may appoint by order.</P>

It appears that the person in question does not have permission to remain in the State as the permission to remain she was granted expired on 17 June 2001. She should contact the immigration and citizenship division of my Department to arrange an appointment to discuss all aspects of her case. The issuance of work permits is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

    <P>The Reception and Integration Agency is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting asylum seekers' accommodation needs under the system of dispersal and direct provision introduced in April 2000. On 28 March 2000 the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, which was subsumed into <Col N="408" /> the RIA with effect from 2 April 2001, entered into a two year memorandum of understanding commencing on 6 April 2000, with the proprietor of the premises in question for the provision of full board accommodation for asylum seekers. The two year term of the memorandum of understanding expired on 5 April 2002. In the intervening period, the RIA, in accordance with Government policy, has brought on stream a number of system-built accommodation centres, including one in the Dublin area with a capacity of up to 400 asylum seekers and a full range of services on site including health, welfare and extensive recreational facilities. In these circumstances, the RIA does not have a requirement for a number of commercial premises in proximity to the system-built centres and, as a consequence, is not in a position to enter into new memoranda with a number of proprietors including the proprietor of the premises in question.</P>

      <P>Under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act, 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian. Section 8(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act provides that a guardian holding office by virtue of these provisions may be removed only by the court. <Col N="410" /> Section 7 of the Act contains provision for the appointment by a parent of a testamentary guardian of the child and for the resolution of disputes about guardianship and custody between the surviving parent and the testamentary guardian. Under section 8(2), if no guardian has been appointed by a deceased parent, the court may appoint a guardian or guardians to act jointly with the surviving parent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note that sections 7 and 8(2) apply whether or not the parents of the child are married to each other. Section 6(3) of the Act provides that, on the death of the mother of a child, the father, if surviving, shall be guardian of the child alone or jointly with any guardian appointed by the mother or by the court. Section 6(2) contains a similar provision with the necessary adjustments for the situation in which the father dies. The word &ldquo;father&rdquo; in this context includes an unmarried father who has become guardian of his child by virtue of one of the provisions referred to in the first paragraph above. I believe these legislative provisions are appropriate and I stress that section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act states that, in court proceedings where the guardianship of a child is in question, the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. If, however, the Deputy wishes to let me know of specific circumstances in which he considers that a change in the law would be desirable, I would be pleased to examine his proposal.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner and I are committed to tackling the supply of illicit drugs. As the Deputy is aware, the Government views the tackling of the drug problem as a high priority. The policies I have implemented since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have resulted in a major crackdown on drug trafficking and organised crime generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have assured me that drug dealing at Neilstown and Rowlagh shopping centres is being addressed by implementing certain initiatives. The Q district drugs team and the Ronanstown neighbourhood policing unit have targeted these areas for special patrol in both plain clothes and uniform. Operation Encounter, which was launched in mid-February, deploys two additional gardaí on duty from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. each night in the Neilstown and Rowlagh areas. The &ldquo;Give Ronanstown a future today&rdquo;, GRAFT, project is a special community based project with a youth diversion focus. The Garda has initiated a drop-in centre every Wednesday night in the CYC centre on the Neilstown Road to cater for those involved in drug misuse. I have been further informed that the current strength of Ronanstown Garda station is 71. The Rowlagh and Neilstown area is actively patrolled by uniformed and plain clothes gardaí. The public <Col N="413" /> order van is detailed from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights to augment the regular patrol units and the divisional task force and traffic units supplement these patrols.</P>
    <P>Clondalkin is one of ten areas included in the first tranche of Garda CCTV systems to be introduced as part of the expansion of Garda CCTV systems. Contracts for the installation of CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick have been awarded and it is intended that the systems will be in place by the end of the year. Work on installing Garda CCTV systems in a further seven areas will commence in 2003, bringing the number of areas where Garda CCTV systems are to be extended to by 2003 to 17 in all.</P>
    <P>Planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Clondalkin, Athlone, Waterford and Tallaght is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers very shortly. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Neilstown and Rowlagh centres are not currently included in the planned Clondalkin Garda CCTV system. The Deputy may, however, wish to note that I plan to introduce a grant scheme to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local communities to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided. Details of this new scheme are being finalised and full particulars including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>The person in question entered the State on 16 December 1998 and claimed asylum. In a letter dated 18 September 2000 he was informed that his application for asylum had been refused. He appealed this decision, but the appeal affirmed the original decision. On 13 August 2001, a letter issued informing him that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him and giving him 15 working days to make written representations setting out any reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. He was given the option of leaving the State before a decision whether or not to order his deportation was taken or of consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations were received as to why he should be allowed to remain in the State and these are being considered by my Department. I expect the case file in relation to the person in question to be submitted to me for decision shortly.</P>

      <P>The Solicitors Acts, 1954 to 2002, provide for a disciplinary tribunal to deal <Col N="417" /> with complaints of misconduct against solicitors. The tribunal consists of ten solicitor members and five lay members. The lay members are appointed on my nomination. A member of the public or the Law Society may apply to the tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of a solicitor. In addition to the tribunal's function in relation to misconduct, the Solicitors Acts give power to the Law Society to deal with complaints against solicitors concerning inadequate services or excessive fees. A member of the public who is dissatisfied with the handling of a complaint by the Law Society may refer the matter to the adjudicator appointed under the Solicitors (Adjudicator) Regulations, 1997. The adjudicator can require the production of documents and make conclusions of fact and recommendations. He may direct the society to re-examine or re-investigate the complaint made to it about a solicitor where he is not satisfied that the society has investigated the complaint adequately. He may also direct the society to make an application to the disciplinary tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of the solicitor on the ground of alleged misconduct. Complaints of misconduct against barristers are dealt with by the Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal, which has lay persons among its members.</P>
      <P>The Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 2002, which was enacted on 13 April and the relevant provisions of which will be commenced by ministerial order, strengthens the disciplinary regime for solicitors in a number of respects, of which the following are examples. It doubles the size of the tribunal to cater for an increased workload and the speedier processing of cases. The tribunal will be required to make a separate finding on each ground of alleged misconduct. Regard must be had to previous findings of misconduct by a solicitor when imposing a sanction in the current case. The maximum amount which a solicitor, in respect of whom there has been a finding of misconduct, may be ordered to pay to an aggrieved party or to the Law Society's compensation fund will increase from £5,000 to &euro;15,000. There will be a right of appeal to the High Court on all aspects of the tribunal's work. The Act provides for remedies against solicitors who fail to co-operate with investigations. The circumstances in which the Law Society may refuse to issue a practising certificate or impose conditions on a certificate are spelt out in more detail than before. The circumstances in which the society can send an investigator to inspect documents at a solicitor's office are also extended.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the new Act will further enhance the provisions for dealing with complaints of misconduct against solicitors. However, I can assure the Deputy that its operation in this regard will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources to individual areas, that the current strength (all ranks) at Maynooth Garda station as at 12 April 2002 is 14. Resources are augmented from within the division as required. Maynooth Garda station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. between Monday and Saturday and from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday. When not open, PACB and call diversion systems are in operation and linked to the district headquarters at Naas Garda station. Messages are relayed to the patrol car at Maynooth, which is manned on a 24 hour basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that there are no plans to designate Maynooth Garda station as a district headquarters. As regards 24 hour cover, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the extension of the current opening to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoors administrative <Col N="420" /> duties who can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties. Local Garda management is satisfied that the arrangements currently in place at Maynooth are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. However, the situation will be kept under review and when additional manpower next becomes available the needs of Maynooth will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Garda Síochána have indicated to an organisation (details supplied) in County Kildare that they are no longer in a position to provide clearance for all prospective child care staff and are limiting same to full-time employees of health boards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 572, 573 and 581 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The historic position as regards the issue of clearance for persons working with children was that the Garda Síochána provided a limited clearance service in respect of such persons. Essentially, it applied to persons in full-time employ<Col N="421" /> ment in the health services who had substantial unsupervised access to children or other vulnerable persons. It did not cover, for example, community workers, part-time employees, student placements or voluntary workers.</P>
    <P>I am on record as stating that the fact that there were a large number of organisations with responsibility for child care, who engage staff, who were not covered by Garda clearance arrangements was a matter of concern for me. I stated that I wished to see the scheme extended to all other organisations dealing with children, for example voluntary and community groups and, accordingly, in June 1999 I announced that the Garda Commissioner was undertaking a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements in the child care area generally.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Garda Commissioner's review it was decided that a central vetting unit would be set up to deal with the existing known demand for clearances. I obtained sanction for additional staff for this unit and, following recruitment and training of new staff, it commenced operations in January of this year. The new unit will provide a better service, with reduced delays, in respect of those employees covered by the existing system, and it will have the capacity to respond to the significant increase in applications for clearances which have been experienced even under the present limited criteria. In addition, it will provide the basis for a phased extension of the existing clearance system in respect of child related employment.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whatever clearance arrangements are in place, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for jobs particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse. There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage, such as good interviewing practice and checking references, and also when it comes to ensuring adequate supervision arrangements after recruitment.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001, obliges convicted sex offenders, including persons convicted abroad as well as in this jurisdiction, before as well as after the commencement of the Act, when seeking or accepting employment or a voluntary position involving unsupervised access to children, to inform their prospective employer of the fact of the conviction. Failure to do so is an offence attracting a maximum penalty when convicted on indictment of a fine not exceeding &euro;12,697 and-or imprisonment for up to five years. This new offence, which came into operation on 27 September 2001, along with the rest of the Act, is designed to act as a deterrent to unsuitable persons from seeking to gain access to children <Col N="422" /> through the workplace, where relationships based on trust or fear can develop.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Special Olympic Games, which were the subject of Question No. 402 of 26 March 2002, the normal vetting procedure applies for volunteers: a criminal record check and a check of any cases under investigation or pending against the prospective volunteer.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles this application under section 49, acquisition of title by virtue of long possession, of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, was lodged on 30 April 2001. Due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners, can take some time to process. I am further informed that queries issued to the lodging solicitor on 16 November 2001 and that the application cannot proceed until these queries <Col N="423" /> have been satisfactorily resolved. I assure the Deputy that the application will receive further consideration as soon as a satisfactory reply to these queries is received.</P>

      <P>The person in question has made two applications to the Minister; the first for refugee status and the second for permission to remain in the State on the basis that he is residing here with his wife, who is an Irish citizen. Applications for refugee status are dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996. Under the Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications and appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted. The two offices created are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which considers applications for a declaration in the event of an appeal. I will make a decision on the application for refugee status in accordance with section 17 of the Act when I receive the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, or, in the event of an appeal, of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>The application for permission to remain in Ireland as the spouse of an Irish national does not come within the ambit of the Refugee Application Commissioner's statutory functions, but is solely a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The application is under consideration at present. It should be borne in mind however that a non-EEA national does not enjoy the right to remain in the State simply by virtue of the fact that he or she is the spouse of an Irish national.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 579 and 580 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I released copies of all correspondence between Deputy Molloy and I to the media on Thursday, 11 April, with the exception of the copy of correspondence from Deputy Molloy's constituent and a sentence referring to personal details which was blocked out in the copies of Deputy Molloy's letter to me of 6 November 2001. I am arranging for a copy of the press statement issued on my behalf on 11 April and copies of the correspondence which accompanied it to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and I became aware of the statement made in court on 9 April by Mr. Justice O'Sullivan in the early afternoon of that day following media reports. Neither I nor my Department were contacted about the matter by Deputy Molloy or his office. I became aware that an official of my Department had been in telephone contact with Mr. Justice O'Sullivan only after it has been stated in open court on the morning of Wednesday, 10 April that such contact had taken place. It was brought to my attention that correspondence with Deputy Molloy concerning the case in question had been handled by the courts policy division of my Department. I issued a statement on the afternoon of Wednesday, 10 April, dealing with the issue of the telephone call made by an officer of the Department to the judge and in relation to the correspondence which had been handled by courts policy division. This was the only correspondence of which I was aware at that time. It later emerged from a search that other correspondence concerning the case in question had been dealt with in my Department's crime and prisons divisions. When I became aware of this correspondence on the evening of <Col N="425" /> the 10 April, I directed that all the correspondence be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) that there are some 6,700 applicants for refugee status awaiting a final recommendation in that Office. This figure refers to all applications received up to the end of March 2002. Of this figure, some 2,530 applications or 38% are in respect of applicants who applied in 2002. The vast majority of the remainder have been scheduled for interview in the next few weeks or have completed the interview process and are awaiting decision.</P>
      <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) has informed me that the estimated number of appeals on hand is 2,432. This figure refers to all appeals received up to 31 March 2002. Seventy-one per cent of these appeals, 1,739, are at an advanced stage of review and processing. The majority of the balance were received in the first three months of 2002.</P>
      <P>At 31 March 2002, only some 2,350 applications were on hand for more than six months in the ORAC and in the region of 582 in the RAT, with the majority of these being in the final stages of processing. This represents considerable progress since the last occasion on which I replied to similar parliamentary questions and, in this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 27, 31, 133 and 154 of 21 February 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident the increased processing capacity which has been put in place in both the ORAC and the RAT as part of the Government's asylum strategy is making a real impact on the backlog of cases. It is also helping to progressively reduce processing times and is seeing significant progress towards the Government's six months processing target. In particular, I would point out that: since July 2001, the number of cases scheduled, processed and completed have significantly exceeded intake; in the ORAC, the number of interviews scheduled for 2001 was more than double the figure for 2000. More than 3,500 interviews were scheduled in the first three months of 2002; the <Col N="428" /> RAT scheduled 170% more hearings in 2001 as compared with 2000. 1,219 hearings were scheduled in the first three months of 2002; the total number of cases processed by the ORAC in 2001 and 2002 to 31 March 2002 was 12,142 and 4,152 respectively; the total number of appeals completed by the RAT in 2001 and 2002 to 31 March 2002 was 3,472 and 1,452 respectively; interviews are at present being scheduled by the ORAC for applicants who arrived in November-December 2001.</P>
    <P>The ORAC is now focusing primarily on the clearance of 2001 applications and May will see the clearance of practically all of these cases. It is expected that by June 2002, the ORAC will be focusing fully on 2002 cases.</P>
    <P>The other statistics requested by the Deputy are as follows: (i) number of applications on hands at end March 2002 in respect of persons who have applied for permission to remain on the basis that they are parents of an Irish born child and who are current or former asylum applicants: 6,740; (ii) number of applications on hands at end March 2002 in respect of persons who have applied for permission to remain on the basis of marriage to an Irish/EU national and who are current or former asylum seekers: 233; (iii) applications outstanding for leave to remain under section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999: 1,985.</P>
    <P>Some of the applicants at (iii) could also have applications pending under (i) or (ii).</P>

The main aims of the project are: to provide general information to the public about the day-to-day operation of the Family Law Courts; to provide statistical information on the Family Law Courts and to report on decisions of the Family Law Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that doubts have arisen in relation to the legality of any reporting of family law cases in the context of the <i>in camera</i> rule. I understand that the Courts Service Board is considering this issue and has obtained Counsel's advice in the matter. If the board conclude that the problem <Col N="430" /> which has been encountered can only be resolved by legislative amendment I will be happy to consider its recommendations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 596 and 597 together.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme 2000-02, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. In order of progress, these stages are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has received a feasibility study for a swimming pool at Kilclooney, Portnoo, County Donegal. This proposal was received after the closing date set for the current local <Col N="432" /> authority swimming pool programme, which was 31 July 2000. It will therefore be considered as soon as the next programme is initiated.</P>
    <P>There are 46 applications at hand in the current swimming pool programme and these applications are at various stages of progress. The funding for the current swimming pool programme is a combined total of &euro;57.15 million for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 601, 602, 608 and 610 to 612, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001. The closing date for the receipt of completed applications was 4 January 2002. In excess of 1,350 applications were received before the closing date and these were evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria. These criteria were outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. The criteria focus on: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport/recreational sport and/or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, i.e. does the project comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities; possession of planning permission; the financial viability of the project, that is in addition to lottery funding, has the club-organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe, previous track record in fund raising is also taken into account; the level of local funding available. Higher rating is given to projects with a significant local contribution; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area and the current and planned levels of sport and/or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements/facilities in relation to the club's or organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>
      <P>Details of the allocations made under the 2002 sport capital programme are available on the Department's website: www.gov.ie/tourism-sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Letters are currently being prepared by my Department and have yet to be issued to appli<Col N="435" /> cants either confirming allocations, and conditions for drawdown under the 2002 programme. In the case of unsuccessful applicants, letters will include a copy of the assessment conducted on their application with final score and explanatory comments, where appropriate, under each of the criteria.</P>
    <P>It is intended to advertise the 2003 sports capital programme later this year. In the event that the organisations in question submit an application under that programme, they will be considered in accordance with the guidelines, terms and conditions which will pertain to the programme.</P>

      <P>Further to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1038 of January 2002, I wish to point out that the grants in question which were awarded under the sports capital programme were paid to the club following compliance by the club with the conditions which apply to such grants and the submission to the Department of the necessary documentation under the terms and conditions of the scheme. This documentation included planning permission covering the spec<Col N="436" /> tator stand and incorporated the facilities underneath.</P>

      <P>Marino and District Community Centre Limited was provisionally allocated £70,000, &euro;88,882, for repairs to its community hall under my Department's sports capital programme in 2000. Following the receipt of professional advice and consultation with Dublin City Council, the organisation in question decided to pursue a complete rebuilding of the community centre as they were advised that a repairs programme would be wasteful expenditure. The organisation accordingly sought an extension of the time frame for the drawdown of the grant and the Department acceded to this request.</P>
      <P>Under the 2002 sports capital programme, Marino and District Community Centre Limited made an application for funding towards the proposed new community hall and a further &euro;300,000 has been provisionally allocated towards their revised proposal. The organisation in question will shortly receive a letter from my Department explaining the conditions which apply to the grant allocation. One of the conditions will refer to a time limit within which the work of the project will have to be completed and the funds drawn down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 613 and 802 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies may be aware that I launched the new disadvantage programme &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; last year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will run over a three-year period and will cost some &euro;33 million. &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to 2,143 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Giving Children an Even Break&rdquo; subsumes the previous process by which schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage were designated. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Rather than employ the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools, carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; and the school referred to by the Deputies has been included in the urban dimension. Urban schools with the highest concentrations of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period, through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes. The school referred to by the Deputies was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of <Col N="438" /> concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>All participating primary schools under &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; are receiving additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in-school and out-of-school supports for the pupils concerned over the three year period. The school referred to by the Deputies has been allocated &euro;6,628 in respect of the 2000-2001 school year and is eligible to receive &euro;5,879 in respect of the current school year.</P>
    <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school referred to by the Deputies were forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. My Department has now received a report from the centre and the situation of this school and other such schools is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action group considered that the target <Col N="439" /> group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education. This category involves child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he or she must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants. My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department other than in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department received an appeal in respect of the candidate referred to by the Deputy. Having reviewed the candidate's application, my Department upheld the decision of the local authority to refuse the application for the special rate of maintenance grant because the reckonable income, in the relevant tax period, exceeded the set income threshold. It is not open to me, or to my Department, to depart from the terms of the special rates of maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant are being reviewed with a view to extending eligibility, to <Col N="440" /> assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I significantly increased the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy refers to the new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched in January 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Giving children an even break involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to 2,143 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>All participating primary schools under giving children an even break are receiving additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of school supports for the pupils concerned over the three year period. A special &euro;63.49 per capita grant is paid in respect of the percentage of pupils with disadvantaged characteristics, with a minimum payment of &euro;952.30 to each participating school.</P>
      <P>Schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme and breaking the cycle pilot project are already in receipt of an annual per capita grant of &euro;38.09 per pupil. Under giving children an even break, an additional &euro;25.39 per capita grant will now be paid to these schools in respect of the percentage of pupils with disadvantaged characteristics, with an overall minimum payment of &euro;952.30 to each school. Giving children an even break has separate urban and rural dimensions. Schools in locations with populations in excess of 1,500 people were categorised as urban. Schools in areas with populations of less than 1,500 people were categorised as rural. Rural schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils have been allocated the services of a teacher-co-ordinator who will work with clusters of four or five schools.</P>
      <P>Rural schools with the highest concentrations that could not be clustered with other schools with similarly high levels of need, are receiving appropriate financial support as an alternative to teacher-co-ordinator support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated overall cost of the programme is &euro;33 million over a three year period. A sum of &euro;5,754,208 has been allocated in grants to schools to date. As part of my ongoing commitment to address educational disadvantage, the level of funding and the number of teacher posts made available under the programme is kept under review having regard to Government policy generally and other competing demands. In addition, the Deputy may be aware that the programme will be subject to independent external eval<Col N="447" /> uation. The outcome of this evaluation will also inform developments in relation to the future resourcing of the programme.</P>

      <P>The projected pupil-teacher ratios in first and second level schools in the current school year are approximately 19.0:1 and 14.0:1, respectively. The most recently published international comparison of pupil-teacher ratios relates to the 1998-99 school year. The table, below, provides data on pupil-teacher ratios at primary and second level in 1998-99 in European countries for which comparable information is readily available. The country means at OECD, European and EU levels are also provided.</P>
      <P>Although the pupil-teacher ratio in Ireland is still above the average for European and OECD countries at primary level, it has fallen very significantly at this level over the past decade leading to a considerable narrowing of the gap with the rest of Europe and the OECD. Furthermore, at second level, the pupil-teacher ratio is now approaching the OECD average having been reduced steadily over recent years.</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide for further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for the national educational psychological service agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; recommended an overall target number of 200 psychologists. It also recommended that this target should be achieved by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>I launched the new NEPS in May 2000 with the 43 psychologists already employed in my Department. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of competitions through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are now almost 100 psychologists deployed in the education sector. The Civil Service Commission is currently at the interview stage for the recruitment of additional psychologists to NEPS. It is envisaged that many of them will be in post by the end of this school year.</P>
      <P>I also announced recently that arrangements are being made to enable the full complement of 200 NEPS psychologists to be appointed by the end of this year, two years ahead of schedule. The NEPS service is now available to approximately 1,950 primary schools &ndash; more than double the number that were served on establishment date &ndash; and to all post-primary schools. Pending the expansion of NEPS to all schools, my Department has allocated funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has issued details of how to avail of this scheme to all schools.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a request to enrol the pupil referred to by the Deputy in the CABAS facility at Scoil Eoin, Greendale Road, Dublin. The facility in question was established in 2001 to operate for a three year pilot period. The operation of the facility, which can cater for 12 children with autism, will be evaluated by my Department before any expansion is considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with autism have access to a range of special support services. To date, approximately 90 special classes dedicated to children with autism have been established within the primary <Col N="450" /> sector and additional such classes are being established on an ongoing basis in response to identified need. Each such class caters for a maximum of six pupils and has the support of a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Children attending all such facilities are also entitled to avail of the special school transport service.</P>
    <P>The task force on autism, which I established in October 2000, has presented a comprehensive range of proposals for the development of services for children with autistic spectrum disorders. This report, which is currently being considered in my Department, will make an important contribution to the future development of services in this area.</P>
    <P>My officials will be in contact with the parents of the pupil in question shortly to discuss the putting in place of an appropriate response to the child's educational needs.</P>

      <P>The revised primary curriculum music programme places a clear emphasis on the need to give children in all classes appropriate levels of experience of instrumental music, as listeners and as responders, as makers of music and as composers. Guidance is provided for teachers on ways of approaching such activity and a wide range of experiences is suggested. I have provided primary schools with a grant of &euro;16.50 per pupil to support teaching and learning in the arts, including music.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, the revised syllabuses for both the junior and leaving certificates emphasise three main activities, namely, listening, performing and composing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students studying these courses have the opportunity of availing of class-based tuition in <Col N="451" /> an instrument and-or voice, and-or may have lessons outside their school in a college or school of music, or privately. In the first case, my Department pays the salaries of the teachers, so there are normally no tuition costs to the students in these circumstances. In the second situation, pupils can and do learn instruments and-or singing outside their own school. Some of these courses are run by the vocational education committees, which my Department helps to fund, notably, County Cork, City of Dublin &ndash; Ballyfermot &ndash; and the City of Limerick. These three were the subject of a recent review.</P>
    <P>My Department is co-operating with the Music Network Feasibility Study to which the Deputy refers. An assistant chief inspector and a senior inspector from my Department sit on an advisory committee linked to the feasibility study which set out to develop a model of local, community-based schools of music.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the joint Oireachtas committee report on school transport have been considered in my Department. A number of improvements were put in place in 2001. These included reducing the qualifying distance for eligibility for school transport for primary school pupils aged ten and over from three to two miles, so that all primary pupils are treated equally for eligibility purposes. The number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new school bus service has been reduced from ten to seven. All school transport vehicles now have a communication system on board. The scope of the remote area grants, payable to pupils in certain circumstances, has been extended and the rate of grant payable has been increased.</P>
      <P>The travelling and waiting time for post-primary pupils has been reduced from three to 2.5 hours. Where feasible students who are on the early pick-up from their homes are the first to be dropped home in the evening, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>The safety aspect of school transport has been examined by the school transport section of my Department together with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A report has just been completed and copies are available from my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Submissions are invited from all interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The development plan for the national educational psychological service agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; envisages that at least 21 educational psychologists will be appointed to Cork city and county when NEPS achieves full nationwide coverage by the end of 2002. The current establishment is 10.5 psychologists. It is not possible at present to include the school attended by the named pupil in the list of those served by NEPS.</P>
      <P>However, I am fully aware of the concern being felt by schools and parents who require psychological support before NEPS can extend to include their areas. Last summer, I announced an initiative whereby funding is being made available to schools to purchase assessment services from suitably qualified private psychologists. This scheme is known as the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments &ndash; SCPA. Details of this scheme were circulated to all schools and are also available on the Department's website. The school mentioned by the Deputy may avail of this scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 642, 644 to 655, inclusive, 719, and 804 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector in order to ensure that schools would remain open, when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March 2002.</P>
      <P>Contingency arrangements were drawn up by the representative management groups, the Joint Managerial Body &ndash; JMB &ndash; the Irish Vocational Education Association &ndash; IVEA &ndash; and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools &ndash; ACS &ndash; following detailed discussions with officials of my Department. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. In addition, my Department undertook to recoup the cost to the management authorities in advertising for, recruiting and training personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis.</P>
      <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, based on a minimum of two hours supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required, this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28 per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers.</P>
      <P>For purposes of the contingency arrangements, payments have been made to schools by my Department, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270 per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum. In addition, funding has also been provided to cover employers' PRSI and holiday pay. Under the contingency arrangements a payment amounting to 5% of supervision costs are been provided to schools to pay for additional support, including secretarial assistance. In aggregate, the sum disbursed to schools amounts to some &euro;12 million, which equates to 12 weeks calculated in accordance with the above formula. The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, the final costs are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advertising for the supervisor posts was organised at national level by the JMB which placed advertisements in the national media over the weekend of 16-17 February on behalf of the managerial authorities of all schools. Schools were advised that in order to secure applications from suitable available personnel, other mechanisms, such as local advertising and local notices, could also be used. The JMB organised training on a regional basis and operated a telephone helpline for schools. In addition, schools were <Col N="456" /> advised to arrange for a period of local induction to familiarise new employees with their specific duties and the school. My Department has recouped &euro;163,981 to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date.</P>
    <P>The contingency plan, by its nature, is flexible and does not specify a pupil-supervisor ratio. As it is recognised that the number of supervisors required would vary from school to school depending on local circumstances including layout, both internal and external, it is considered that individual school management authorities are best placed to assess the level of cover and the number of persons required on an ongoing basis. Responsibility accordingly for the making of appointments is a matter for school authorities. Schools were advised through the contingency plan as to the terms and conditions of employment that were appropriate to the appointments. The terms and conditions include the duties to be performed by each appointee and the accountability arrangements for the performance of these duties. Schools were not advised to give a preference in making appointments to unemployed people. Information concerning the number of persons recruited by schools to carry out supervision duties, the number of hours worked per supervisor and previous employment status is not available to my Department.</P>
    <P>In the case of schools in County Mayo, the information requested by the Deputy is being compiled in my Department and will be forwarded directly to him.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the major new programme, &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;, which I announced in January 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools last year. This programme replaces the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; will be run over a three-year period and will cost some &euro;33 million, with the allocation of over 200 teaching posts.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;. The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of &euro;3,298 in respect of the 2001-02 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>Since the programme was launched, schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are being supported, where necessary, over the three-year period through staff allocations to implement a maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes, infants through second class, and 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes. Starting in the 2002-03 school year, I have approved the reduction in the maximum class size in senior classes from 29:1 to 27:1, for these selected urban schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy. The maximum class size for junior classes will remain at 20:1.</P>
      <P>In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; in respect of the 2002-03 school year will be determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 2001. This process is under way at present in my Department and the school in question will be informed of its allocation as soon as possible. I am aware that this school has also made representations concerning a possible increase in its enrolments for September next. This factor will also be taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 657 to 660, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>For young parents of school-going age, the most pressing needs are considered to be a sensitive response to their needs, appropriate counselling-mentoring and medical assistance, minimum disruption of tuition, and appropriate access to childcare. For older parents returning to education, there are the added needs for flexible part time options and appropriate financial supports.</P>
      <P>Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl's needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected. Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical.</P>
      <P>In addition, special arrangements for examinations may be made if required under which a pupil who does not wish to sit the exam in her main centre may do so in a separate room or in hospital. If a candidate feels unwell during the course of the examinations, she may be allowed to leave the examination centre and be re-admitted provided that she has been in the care of the principal or a representative of the school authority during her absences. In exceptional circumstances, a candidate may take the examinations at a later time than the scheduled time but on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, a new child care measure was introduced to encourage young parents to access the Youthreach and senior Traveller training centre programmes for early school leavers, and the <Col N="459" /> vocational training opportunities scheme for the long-term unemployed. Under the scheme, funds are provided to vocational education committees for direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on existing commercial or community crèches, or payment of childminders subject to a maximum of £50 per week per child and compliance with tax and health board registration requirements. At present some 1,050 parents and 1,308 children are benefiting from the initiative at a cost of &euro;3 million, £2.4 million, per annum. The 10% quota which limited participation of lone parents, dependant spouses and those with disabilities on the VTOS programme was also removed in 1998.</P>
    <P>Applications have been invited from schools and vocational education committees to participate in a Back to Education initiative under which part-time options are being made available in further education, particularly targeted at young people and adults with less than upper second level education. Some 6,000 part-time places are being offered this year, and this will increase on a phased basis to a level of 20,000 extra places per annum by 2006. Tuition will be free for participants or dependants of those with medical cards, a means-tested welfare payment, unemployment payment or family income supplement. Holders of one parent family payments are eligible for free tuition under the initiative. The objective of the Back to Education initiative is to provide flexible part-time options under which participants can combine a return to learning with family and work responsibilities. While my Department is not in a position to provide childcare supports for the programme, schools and colleges have been advised that application may be made by them to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for funds for capital and staffing costs of community based crèches. The part-time Back to Education initiative and the programmes for early school leavers are part funded by the European Social Fund under the National Development Fund 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>With regard to PLC and third level courses, the arrangements for assessing income for means-tested student maintenance grants provides that the one parent family payments is one of the payments which may be excluded in the calculation of reckonable income. Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to third level students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Students with family responsibilities, particularly in relation to childcare costs, may receive assistance from the fund. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 <Col N="460" /> academic year to &euro;7.49, million £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the recommendations which came from the first national conference on teenage pregnancy in Ireland held in Jury's Hotel on 15 May 2001, in particular the first recommendation calling for the establishment of a single national co-ordinating body to act as an umbrella group for all local initiatives working with teenage mothers here; if the Government has acted on this particular recommendation; if so, if this body will be fully funded by the Government; the progress which has been made on any of the other recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have been informed that my Department has no record of receiving details of the recommendations arising from the first national conference on teenage pregnancy in Ireland. Accordingly, I am not in a position to comment on the recommendations referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to reducing the number of pupils, including young single parents, who leave school before completion of the senior cycle. My Department does not prescribe any special rules for the treatment of pregnant schoolgirls by school authorities. However, I would expect that in dealing with any particular case, school management would have regard to the sensitivity of the situation and would have as its priority the well-being of the pupil concerned. I would hope that pregnancy would cause no more than a temporary absence from school and each pupil would be in a position to resume her education following the birth of the child.</P>
      <P>Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl's needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected. Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls who are pupils at recognised schools. It is provided to pupils who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, special arrangements for examinations may be made if required under which a pupil who does not wish to sit the exam in her main centre may do so in a separate room or in hospital. If a candidate feels unwell during the course of the examinations, she may be allowed leave the examination centre and be re-admitted provided that she has been in the care of the principal or a representative of the school authority <Col N="461" /> during her absences. In exceptional circumstances, a candidate may take the examinations at a later time than the scheduled time but on the same day.</P>
    <P>In 1998, a scheme of childcare was introduced for early school leavers on Youthreach and senior Traveller training centre programmes and for unemployed adults on VTOS. The scheme provides funds for direct provision of crèches, purchase of places on community or commercial crèches, or payment of childminders subject to tax compliance and registration as required with the health boards. Some 1,308 children and 1,050 parents are currently benefiting from the measure at a cost of &euro;3 million, £2.4 million, per annum.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the controversy that has arisen in relation to one particular school. This school is under the patronage of An Foras Patrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán Ghaeilge and its ethos is described by the patron body as being of an inter-denominational character, whereby equal status is to be given to the Catholic and Church <Col N="462" /> of Ireland religions. It is a matter for patron bodies to decide upon the ethos that will apply in individual schools and neither I, nor my Department, have any wish to interfere in such matters.</P>
      <P>However, in order to establish if my Department can assist in resolving the controversy that has arisen in relation to this particular school, my officials have been in contact with a number of parties, including the patron body, with a view to exploring whether a process of facilitation would be acceptable to all parties.</P>
      <P>Contact is ongoing between my Department and various parties and, in the circumstances, I propose to await the outcome of those contacts before making any comments on this issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos 667 and  685 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may be aware that I launched the new programme, &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools last year. This programme replaces the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; will be run over a three-year period and will cost some &euro;33 million with the allocation of over 200 teaching posts.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;. The school in question has been included in the rural dimension and is eligible to receive supplementary grant aid of &euro;952 in respect of the 2001-2002 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. Rural schools with the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage were clustered into groups of four to five and each cluster is entitled to the services of a teacher-co-ordinator to work with the schools in relation to the needs of the pupils concerned. The school in question was not considered eligible for clustering, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
      <P>The position of this school will fall for consideration again in any future expansion of the programme. The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2000 was 75 pupils, which warrants a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for this school year. It is a matter for the board of management of the school to advertise and conduct interviews for the filling of these posts in accordance with the rules for national schools. The school in question in question has a learning support post shared with other schools in the area. The school also has ten part-time resource teaching hours for special needs pupils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 675 and 676 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the current supply difficulties. As part of a range of initiatives to improve teacher supply, the intake to the B Ed programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999 more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B Ed programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,750 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. The number of places made available on the graduate diploma courses since 1997 is 1,453. Between 2001 and 2002 it is projected that some 2,300 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level, as an academic subject, as part of their teaching qualification, are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. Since September 2000, teachers employed in a tempor<Col N="469" /> ary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education, are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate, pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers. Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers, who trained outside the State, to teach in certain categories of schools and classes, without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification, is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>All schools including schools classified as disadvantaged have gained from improvements to the staffing schedule in recent years. St. Michael's CBS and St. Francis CBS national schools have both got concessionary teaching posts on disadvantage grounds. The question of paying a further allowance to teachers based in disadvantaged schools is a matter which may be dealt with together with other pay related matters by the Teachers Conciliation Council. A teacher exchange scheme already exists in primary schools whereby a teacher may voluntarily exchange with a teacher in any other school. In-service provision is being offered by this Department to any existing or additional teacher appointed to tackle disadvantage under the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Giving Children an Even Break&rdquo; schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 677, 678 and 696 to 698, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>At present, dance is a component of the physical education programme at primary and post-primary level. In the leaving certificate applied programme dance is a separate element and is formally examined. A number of schools also offer a post leaving certificate course in dance and students can study it up to Further Education and Training Awards Council level 2. At third level, dance is an element of the undergraduate physical education course at the University of Limerick and further post-graduate opportunities are provided for students who wish to pursue study in the area of dance. I have also announced the plans to develop the Irish Academy for the Performing Arts. The academy will initially provide under-graduate and post-graduate training in music, dance and drama. The professional dance education facility will be based at the Institute for Choreography and Dance at Firkin Crane in Cork. The academy will also have a strong research and development arm and a strong continuing professional development role. The development of the academy will be driven forward by the interim governing authority, which I shall be establishing shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies may also be aware, the Arts Council has recently published the Arts Plan 2002-2006, which has been endorsed by the Government. This plan contains an objective to improve education and training for dance. My Department has no function in the recognition of the Council for Dance Education and Training accredited colleges based in the United Kingdom. In relation to support available for students studying abroad, in 1996 the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in <Col N="471" /> the Republic and Northern Ireland. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. I understand the colleges recognised by the Council for Dance Education and Training in the UK are private colleges. They would not come within the scope of the definition of an approved course under the terms of the third level maintenance grant schemes and there are no plans at present to expand the schemes to include courses in private colleges in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000, as amended by Section 29 of the Finance Act, 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for undergraduate tuition fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

      <P>Officials in my Department have recently completed an analysis of the existing post-primary school facilities in Ballinamore, with a view towards determining the future location of the proposed new community school. To promote a consultative approach to this decision-making process, the management authorities of the three existing schools have been invited to meet officials of the post-primary building unit to discuss all of the options identified in the analysis. This meeting will be convened in the near future. The next step in the process will then be to determine the accommodation requirements of the new school and to embark on the architectural planning phase of the project.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of primary schools are experiencing some difficulties in recruiting qualified teachers. The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the current supply difficulties. As part of a range of initiatives to improve teacher supply, the intake to the B Ed programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999 more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B Ed programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,750 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. The number of places made available on the graduate diploma courses since 1997 is 1,453. Between 2001 and 2002 it is projected that some 2,300 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level, as an academic subject, as part of their teaching qualification, are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are <Col N="474" /> paid as fully trained substitute teachers. Since September 2000, teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education, are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate, pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers. Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers, who trained outside the State, to teach in certain categories of schools and classes, without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification, is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The position generally regarding site acquisition is that where such a development is considered necessary, arrangements are made by my Department to acquire the site. Purchase is subject to the availability of funding and the priority to be accorded to the project. In addition, my Department must be fully satisfied that the school's long-term viability is assured and permanent recognition must have been granted. An application for permanent recognition of the school in question is currently being examined in the planning section of my Department. The assessment of the school's application is nearing <Col N="475" /> completion and the school authorities will be advised of the outcome shortly. The position regarding site acquisition and the provision of permanent accommodation will be considered by my Department in the event that permanent recognition is granted and in light of available capital resources.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. My Department will give detailed consideration this year to an application from the authorities of St. Patrick's National School, Clogh, Castlecomer for grant-aid towards improved accommodation as part of the Government's expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to an application for funding under the fund for the development of targeted responses to children at risk which was received from Ballybeg Community Education Project in 2001. This fund is overseen by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. The purpose of this fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>In assessing applications, consideration was given to Department supported interventions already in place in the areas concerned so as to avoid duplication of effort and resources. In this regard, my Department is providing support for an eight to 15 Early School Leaver Project &ndash; ESLI &ndash; in the Ballybeg area. It was considered that there was a substantial overlap between the aims, objectives, the target group identified and the services provided under both the ESLI project and the Ballybeg community education project. It was, therefore, decided that it would be inappropriate to continue to fund these projects on a separate basis. Accordingly, both project groups were requested in writing to come together to develop a joint proposal for consideration by my Department. I also arranged for a co-ordinator to work with both groups to assist them in developing a single holistic plan that would address the educational needs of the children at risk in the Ballybeg area. The co-ordinator has now recommended that the educational aspects of the Ballybeg community education project should be supported through the existing ESLI project in the Waterford area. This recommendation is acceptable to me and will be communicated to the groups involved this week by my Department.</P>

Pupils attending school in an adjacent catchment area are not eligible for full school transport but may avail of catchment boundary facilities from the nearest pick up point in the catchment area of the school attended, provided there is room on the bus after all eligible pupils have been accommodated. If the names, addresses and dates of birth of the pupils, referred to by the Deputy, are provided, my Department will investigate the matter as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. Robertstown national school is being extended-refurbished as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The correspondence, referred to by the Deputy, has been received by my Department and its receipt acknowledged. A detailed reply will issue shortly. With regard to the issue of entry to third level education by students with a disability, third level institutions in Ireland have certain rights and responsibilities, enshrined in legislation, to determine their own admissions policies. The Universities Act, 1997, requires each university to prepare a statement of its equality policy addressing, <i>inter alia</i>, access of people who have a disability. The Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, sets out in section 7(5) that &ldquo;In performing its functions a governing body shall have regard to the attainment of gender equity and of equality of opportunity in education&rdquo;. The Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, contains a similar provision.</P>
      <P>Students applying for a place in a third level institution generally do so through the Central Applications Office. The CAO processes applications for entry to courses in universities, colleges of education, institutes of technology and other institutions of higher education in the Republic. Applicants with disabilities who wish to be considered for non-standard entry may also make a direct application to the college of their choice.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. The third level student support schemes operated under the aegis of my Department do not extend to postgraduate study outside of Ireland. The student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing certain full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in another EU member state, with effect from the 1996-97 academic year. The <Col N="483" /> extension of the schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to extend the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing post-graduate courses outside Ireland. Any such extension could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector. However, section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provides for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states as well as in private colleges in this State. This relief, which applies at the standard rate of tax, is available to full time and part time postgraduate students and includes distance education courses offered by publicly funded colleges in other EU member states.</P>

      <P>The admission of individual students to a university is a matter for the individual university concerned. Furthermore, I understand from enquiries made by the Higher Education Authority that Trinity College Dublin is not in a position to release personal information concerning an individual's application to a third party. However, the university would be prepared to release all relevant information on file to the applicant concerned. I further understand that Trinity College Dublin did operate a mature student aptitude test in February 2002 as part of its selection procedures. This test was administered in three venues. However, its administration was seriously disrupted in two of these venues, following the tragic death of a candidate in one venue and the persistent refusal of a small number of candidates to adhere to the invigilator's instructions in another venue. Accordingly, Trinity College decided to render the results of all candidates tested null and void and it assessed applications without reference to the aptitude test results and shortlisted candidates for interview on the basis of the information contained in their application forms.</P>

      <P>The admission of individual students to a university is a matter for the individual university concerned. Inquiries have been made with the Higher Education Authority in relation to the transfer procedures in operation and I understand that the medical faculties generally do not accept students on transfer from other medical schools. This approach is adopted having regard to the high level of demand for places in our medical schools and the low attrition rates in medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the documentation forwarded by the Deputy that the individual concerned has applied to each of the five medical schools without success. In the circumstances, the options open to the individual are to continue to <Col N="486" /> apply for medicine on the basis of his leaving certificate points in the hope that the points might fall and then, if successful, apply for exemption from the first year of the course on the basis of his studies abroad. The granting of exemptions is a matter for the individual faculty. Alternatively, he could apply as a mature student and if successful, apply for any exemptions. In order to apply as a mature student a candidate must be 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry. As the Deputy will appreciate, I have no function in the matter of the admission of any individual student.</P>

      <P>The chief examiner's report on Irish in the 2001 leaving certificate has recently been published. The report demonstrates that examiners reported that the questions in the papers were so phrased as to give candidates very good opportunities to demonstrate their competence and knowledge of both the course content and the medium, and so achieve high marks. It is also interesting to note that the percentages of students achieving A, B and C grades on the leaving certificate ordinary level papers has been rising consistently in the period 1997 to 2001. Similar satisfaction was expressed by the chief examiner in his report to the Department about the suitability of the junior certificate ordinary level examination paper in Irish and in the quality of both the answers and the awards they attracted. However, the Deputy should note that sample question papers and in-school examination papers are prepared by commercial publishers.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, they may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all enquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>

      <P>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department and a reply was issued on 27 March 2002. I have had the specific sample questions referred to in the correspondence examined by a member of the inspectorate of my Department. It appears the sample question paper used by the correspondent was produced by a commercial publisher and not the examinations branch of my Department. While commercial publishers may produce materials in formats similar to that in use in the State examinations, my Department can only be responsible for official State Examination papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the most recently produced chief examiner's report on leaving certificate Irish demonstrates that in the 2001 examination, examiners reported that the questions in prose and poetry on the ordinary level paper gave candidates very good opportunities to demonstrate their competence and knowledge in these aspects of the course, that questions were answered very satisfactorily, and that high marks were awarded. It is also interesting to note that the percentages of <Col N="491" /> students achieving A, B and C grades on the ordinary level paper has been rising consistently in the period 1997 to 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the school referred to by the Deputy is a private concern providing a tuition service for children at primary and post primary level with dyslexia. The resources available to my Department are generally targeted towards school based supports for children with special <Col N="492" /> educational needs, including children with specific learning disability. The range of special support services provided by my Department constitutes a very significant response to the educational needs of students with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia. I intend to continue to monitor developments in this area to ensure adequate provision continues to be made available to these pupils. My Department is currently considering the report of the task force on dyslexia, which I established in October 2000. The report deals with a range of complex issues and puts forward some 61 individual recommendations aimed at improving current services in the area in question.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of pupils with dyslexia of primary school age are generally capable of being met within the mainstream school system with the support, where necessary, of the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. There are currently 1,485 learning support teachers and more than 1,500 full time equivalent resource teacher posts in primary schools. For some children, the severity of the condition can be such as to require placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. At present, there are four special schools and 20 special classes dedicated to children with dyslexia. Funding is also provided to meet any special equipment needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>At second level, pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support through the learning support teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the severity of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations. In December 2000, I announced a highly innovative nationwide pilot scheme to assist second level students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. Thirty-one schools around the country are participating in the pilot project costing more than &euro;2.5 million. Each student with dyslexia is provided with a laptop computer and specially designed software for school and home use. In addition to funding in-school support services, my Department supports the work of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland in providing classes for children with dyslexia outside of school hours. An annual funding allocation of &euro;63,486.90 is made to the association to support this work.</P>

      <P>The third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees (TLT scheme) administered by the vocational education committees, under the aegis of my Department, provides means tested maintenance grants to eligible students attending approved third level courses in the institutes of technology. The TLT scheme allows for the payment of registration fees up to &euro;396 for those students who qualify for a maintenance grant by reference to the prescribed upper income limits. The TLT maintenance grants scheme, 2001, which issued to the vocational education committees on 9 July 2001 did not contain any changes in relation to the provision for the payment of the student registration fee.</P>
      <P>However, a letter, which issued on the same date and which listed the amendments to all four maintenance grant schemes operated under the aegis of my Department, included, by mistake, a reference to an amendment to the TLT scheme to provide for the payment of a student registration examination fee, subject to prescribed upper income limits, where candidates did not qualify for a maintenance grant. Department officials subsequently contacted each VEC to clarify the position, to rectify the error in the letter and to ensure that the terms of the TLT scheme, as issued, were being implemented consistently. Subsequently a circular letter also issued to the vocational education committees advising them in the matter. Each year, the three third level maintenance grants schemes and the post Leaving Certificate maintenance grant scheme are reviewed by my Department and revised as necessary.</P>

      <P>I have been informed that my Department has no record of an application for the type of support referred to by the Deputy. My Department operates a scheme of home tuition which provides compensatory instruction for students who, because of serious medical conditions or other difficulties, are unable to attend school or are absent from school for prolonged periods. I understand the pupil in question is currently attending school and is receiving resource teacher support. If an application for increased educational support for the child in question is received in my Department the matter will be given full consideration.</P>

      <P>In 2000, as part of my Department's reading initiative, learning support guidelines were provided to all schools and were aimed at ensuring that all children achieve appropriate levels of literacy and numeracy during the course of their primary education. The learning support guidelines recommend high levels of co-operation between class teachers, learning support teachers and parents in supporting children who are experiencing learning difficulties. In selecting pupils for remedial education, priority should be given to those pupils who achieve scores at or below the 10th percentile. To allow for measurement error, consideration may be given to selecting pupils who achieve scores up to and including the 12th percentile. Once schools are satisfied that the needs of pupils who have very low achievement or serious learning difficulties have been met, a limited degree of flexibility may be exercised in the deployment of the learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The principal teacher has overall responsibility for the school's learning-support programme and for the operation of services for children with special educational needs. Once a pupil has come to the attention of the school because of low achievement or learning difficulties, it is possible for the class teacher, in the context of ongoing contact with the pupil's parents, to make them aware of the situation and to ascertain the parent's views about the child's performance at school; outline school practices regarding the administration of diagnostic tests by the learning-support teacher; outline the support that is available to the pupils in school whose achievement is low and/or who experience learning difficulties; seek the parents' approval to proceed with the diagnostic assessment, which may lead to supplementary teaching, and indicate that a meeting between the parents and the learning support teacher will take place following the diagnostic assessment and prior to the commencement of supplementary teaching. If, following diagnostic assessment, it is agreed that the pupil should receive remedial teaching, the parents can contribute to the development and implementation of their child's individual profile and learning programme by discussing the learning targets for their child and by identifying activities that can be implemented at home to support the work of the school in achieving the agreed targets.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is reviewed annually following discussions with the education partners. The staffing arrangements for the 2002-03 school year have been finalised and details of changes to the staffing schedule were notified to boards of management of primary schools recently. The proposal made by the Deputy would have to be considered in the context of discussions on staffing arrangements for mainstream schools for the 2003-04 school year which would be expected to commence in December 2002.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may already be aware that schools included in the urban dimension of Breaking the Cycle benefit from a maximum class size of 15:1 in their junior classes. The Deputy may also be aware that I launched the new disadvantage programme, Giving Children An Even Break, in January 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will run over a three year period and will cost some &euro;33 million. Giving Children An Even Break involves the creation of more than 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to 2,143 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to Giving Children An Even Break. Urban schools with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three year period, through staff allocations, to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and <Col N="504" /> a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.

      <Quest>if he will provide additional funding to schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme, to enable them to employ secretarial and caretaking staff, due to the extra needs and additional services required in schools in disadvantaged areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>All schools, including those in disadvantaged areas, have benefited from the substantial improvements that I have made towards the provision of secretarial and caretaking support services. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under community employment schemes, I recently secured the transfer of some &euro;58.4 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003, as the FÁS school based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department received a total of &euro;40.6 million for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from &euro;50.79 per pupil per annum to &euro;126.98 per pupil over this school year and the next. With effect from September 2001, the grant was increased from &euro;50.79 to &euro;76.18 per pupil. This has been further increased to &euro;101.58 per pupil with effect from January 2002. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less has increased from &euro;3,047.37 to &euro;6,094.74 per annum, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from &euro;25,394.76 to &euro;50,789.52 per annum.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to second level schools. The standard per capita grant from &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;256.49 in this school year, and will be further significantly increased by &euro;10 for the next school year to &euro;266.49. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita </i>grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools will benefit from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil to &euro;99.04 per pupil over this school year and the next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" />Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. I recently announced a major equalisation measure for voluntary secondary schools. Under the terms of this measure, the support services grant will be increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This will bring the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September next and to &euro;127.04 per pupil from 1 January next. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school &ndash;&euro;44.44 per pupil &ndash; per annum that was approved for secondary schools last December. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of up to &euro;236,761, and &euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services including secretarial and caretaking services.</P>

      <P>There was a commitment in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to the development of psychological services, including assessment services for those with special needs, for children <Col N="508" /> and young people. The Government began to fulfil this commitment by establishing a National Educational Psychological Service agency on 1 September 1999. The development plan for NEPS provides for a gradual expansion until all schools have access to the service, with a high priority being given to schools serving disadvantaged children. The terms of the Government decision to establish NEPS outlined how this target would be attained over a period of years, with the number of psychologists increasing gradually to 200. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of recruitment competitions for professional staff, the complement of the agency doubled from 43 psychologists on the date of establishment to 86 on 31 December 2001. In addition to NEPS staff, there are also a number of other psychologists working in the educational sector, bringing the current total to almost 100. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is reaching the final stages of the current recruitment competition for NEPS. It is hoped that it will be possible to appoint more than 60 psychologists from this competition. Furthermore, the Government has given approval to an acceleration of the planned recruitment of psychologists, with a view to reaching the target number of 200 by the end of 2002, two years ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been delays in certain areas of the country in the process of assessing children with special educational needs and I am committed to expediting access to psychological assessments. As I announced last summer, I have made funding available for schools to purchase assessment services from suitably qualified private practitioners pending the recruitment of the full complement of psychologists to NEPS. The agency has issued details of how to avail of this scheme to all schools.</P>

      <P>The present situation with regard to the psychological service provided by the national educational psychological service agency to schools in County Kildare is as follows: all post-primary and 29 primary schools, school population c. 10,000 pupils, now have access to the service. A number of these schools are in the Celbridge area. In addition, 28 primary schools, population c. 4,000 pupils, in north-west Kildare, are involved in a pilot introductory programme during this school year, with a view to extending the NEPS service to them in the next school year. These schools were chosen to participate in this pilot intervention because of their location in an area designated as one of significant disadvantage. A list of these schools has previously been supplied to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The recent recruitment competition for psychologists in NEPS organised by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission has proved successful and new appointments will be made in the near future. A number of these will be made to the Eastern Region, south-western area, which will permit further phased expansion in County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first priority for expansion will be the schools in the pilot area. Expansion to other <Col N="513" /> schools in the county will follow, as resources permit, and is expected to take place within the next year. All primary schools in the county which do not, as yet, have access to the NEPS service may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessment, as may the schools in the pilot area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the stay safe programme involves in-service training for the school staff, parent education and personal safety skills education for primary school children. Since its introduction in 1991, almost all schools, 98.6%, have participated in in-service training and 87% have facilitated parent education regarding child protection issues. Results of a survey carried out in 1999-00 show that 74% of schools are teaching the stay safe programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recommended that the programme be taught to children twice during the junior cycle, infants to second class, and twice during senior cycle, third to sixth class. Schools that are <Col N="516" /> implementing the programme are offered ongoing support and training for teachers and parents by the child abuse prevention programme. There is an increase in the number of hitherto non-participating schools requesting teacher training or parent education regarding stay safe. Although it is not mandatory for schools to implement the programme, it is anticipated that the full introduction of the children first guidelines which state that &ldquo;school management should provide for the planning, development and implementation of an effective child protection programme&rdquo; will result in an increase in the number of schools teaching stay safe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national educational psychological service was established on 1 September 1999 and is an executive agency of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>NEPS has delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students in primary and post-primary schools and in certain other centres supported by the Department. Provision of assessments is part of the work of the educational psychologists in NEPS.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board and voluntary bodies under its aegis also provide assessment services for children in the Cork area and the availability and development of such services is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that there will be at least 21 NEPS psychologists deployed in Cork City and County when NEPS has achieved full nationwide coverage by the end of 2002. Notwithstanding the time-consuming nature of recruitment competitions for professional staff, the complement of psychologists in the Cork area has increased from six on establishment date to 10.5 on 31 December 2001. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is reaching the final stages of the current recruitment competition for NEPS. It is intended to appoint additional psychologists to the southern region from this competition.</P>
      <P>The NEPS service is now available in the Cork area to approximately 100 primary schools and to 87 post-primary schools. Pending the expansion of NEPS to the remaining schools in the area, my Department has allocated funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has issued details of how to avail of this scheme to all schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educational psychologists in NEPS do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are worked through in order. Each psychologist is responsible for a number of named schools, and visits each school on a regular basis. The school authorities provide names of children who are giving cause for concern and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist's visits. This allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and these children will be seen or referred on in a matter of weeks, if not days. Where cases are less urgent, the psychologist will, as a preliminary measure, act as a consultant to <Col N="522" /> teachers and parents, offer advice about educational and behavioural plans and monitor progress.</P>

      <P>However, I am fully aware of the concern being felt by schools and parents who require psychological support before NEPS can extend to include their areas.

The school mentioned by the Deputy may avail of this scheme and NEPS will bear the cost of the assessment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fully recognised to teach at primary level and therefore be entitled to take up permanent posts, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification usually can be achieved by a person graduating from one of the <Col N="531" /> recognised teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the post-graduate conversion courses, or by a primary teacher trained abroad achieving the necessary level of competence in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>Recognised third level qualifications, together with the Higher Diploma in Education, would normally allow the holders to be appointed to full time positions in second level schools. However, these qualifications are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools.</P>
      <P>However, as part of a range of measures taken by my Department to address the shortage of qualified teachers at primary level, secondary trained teachers, that is persons holding a recognised primary degree together with a Higher Diploma in Education, which would normally entitle an individual to teach at post-primary level, are remunerated at the trained rate of pay when they take up substitute or temporary positions in primary schools. Previous service given by such teachers in second level schools will be reckoned for incremental purposes. In implementing this measure however there is no intention that qualified second level teachers would be afforded full recognition as primary school teachers. In order to become so qualified, such teachers would have to undertake a post-graduate conversion course in one of the colleges of education.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the schemes re-entering means entering as a mature student following a break of at least one year and having previously attended an undergraduate or postgraduate course approved for the purposes of the higher education grant schemes.
