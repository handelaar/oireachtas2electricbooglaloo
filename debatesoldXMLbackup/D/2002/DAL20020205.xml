      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The most recent plenary meeting on the overall implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness took place yesterday. The main items on the agenda were budget 2002 and the current economic outlook, health care and lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance made a comprehensive presentation on budget 2002 and the current economic outlook. The presentation outlined the measures taken by the Government in budget 2002 in terms of investment in infrastructure, public services and social inclusion, as well as the tax measures contained in the budget. It also covered the continuing uncertainties around the timing of the international recovery and identified the key competitiveness challenges in the period going forward, including continuing cost-price inflation and the possibility of a sharp rise of the euro against the US dollar and the pound sterling. The presentation pointed up that while the projected rates of economic growth are lower than those we have experienced in the recent past, they will be more sustainable and considerably higher than most of our EU counterparts.</P>
      <P>On lifelong learning, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment gave a presentation on progress to date by the task force on lifelong learning in developing a strategic framework in this area. The report of the task force is currently being finalised with a view to consideration at a meeting scheduled for 27 February and it is expected to be published in the near future. The Department of Education and Science covered the significant progress which has been made in the area of adult education, as well as new developments planned for 2002. These include the major expansion in part-time options under the back to education initiative, the very successful &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo; television series and the establishment of the National Adult Learning Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children gave a presentation on the new health strategy which the Government launched in November last and which is designed to achieve better health for everyone, fair access, responsive and appropriate care and high performance in the delivery of health care There was a very positive reaction to the new strategy, including in particular the special focus on primary care. As with all PPF plenary meetings, a detailed progress report was produced for this meeting, setting out for each Department, including my own, the progress being made under each action point in the PPF. This seventh report, copies of which have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library, records the continuing good progress in implementing the <Col N="1071" /> ambitious economic, social and structural agenda set out in the programme.</P>
    <P>The next plenary meeting is scheduled to take place on Monday, 29 April 2002, the agenda for which has yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>On meetings between myself and the social partners, I meet representatives of individual social partner organisations on a regular basis, in addition to the annual attendance of the Taoiseach and other Ministers at the PPF plenary meeting in July, in accordance with established practice.</P>
    <P>On the areas of the PPF which are my specific responsibility, my Department exercises the main co-ordinating role for overall implementation of the programme as well as supporting a range of cross-departmental issues, such as public service modernisation, infrastructure delivery, social inclusion and the information society. In addition, my Department chairs the National Implementation Body which was established under the adjustments to the terms of the PPF in December 2000. This body continues to meet as necessary to consider, in particular, the potential implications of ongoing disputes of special national importance.</P>

      <P>Was the ASTI dispute raised at yesterday's meeting of the social partners? Deputies are aware that the ASTI rejected the Government's offer of increased rates of pay for substitution and supervision and insurance difficulties mean that schools may have to shut in March. Joint managerial bodies and organisations representing vocational education committees have asked the Government to put contingency plans in place. Were such plans discussed yesterday? Will plans be made? What does the Government intend to do to ensure that secondary schools remain open until April and the examination season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The ASTI dispute was not discussed at yesterday's meeting, although it will be discussed shortly by officials from the National Implementation Body. All three unions representing teachers have considered the substitution and supervision offer. While members of the INTO accepted the offer following a ballot, TUI members voted by a narrow margin not to accept it and the ASTI decided to reject the offer and to withdraw from supervision and substitution duties, with effect from 4 March. It has been made clear that the core terms of the offer will not be improved and pension issues cannot be considered if trade unions continue to insist that the work is voluntary. The Minister for Education and Science has stated that alternative arrangements will be put in place to ensure that students and parents are not disadvantaged. Money will be made available to schools to recruit suitable and appropriate personnel to carry out supervision duties. School managers have agreed to make every effort to ensure that <Col N="1072" /> schools will not close. Discussions about contingency plans are ongoing and it is expected that guidelines will be issued shortly. Grants can be paid to schools at short notice.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the economy was discussed at yesterday's meeting? While I share his modest optimism as regards economic growth, it is clear that a serious fiscal problem is emerging. The Taoiseach is aware that Government figures, which do not provide for benchmarking, the implementation of the health strategy or any future pay round, project a deficit of about &euro;4 billion in 2003 and about &euro;5 billion in 2004. I presume the Exchequer figures for January, which show that public expenditure is continuing at 22% or 23% and that revenue continues to decrease, were discussed at yesterday's meeting. What is the Taoiseach's plan? Does he intend to lead us into a crisis similar to that of the 1980s, when there was a large divergence between public expenditure and tax revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Economic and budgetary policies were discussed and debated yesterday. The main points put to yesterday's meeting were that economic growth for last year will probably end up at about 5.2% and that it will be about 3.5% this year. The international economy remains weak and there is a slowdown in most major economies. I referred in my reply to the differing views regarding the uncertainty about the international recovery. There is not much point going through those views as it depends on who one reads or listens to.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the economic context of the budget were discussed yesterday as were the budgetary prospects. The Deputy is aware of the Government's view that this year will be tight and that we have to continue our tight fiscal and monetary policies to ensure that we do not drift back into borrowing. However, in spite of this situation there are significant expenditure increases where needed. The gross voted capital expenditure for this year is up 12%. Almost &euro;1 billion is being spent on roads, almost &euro;500 million is being spent on public enterprise and public transport, about &euro;1 billion on housing and about &euro;600 million on education.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the officials outlined to the social partnership process that gross current expenditure for this year is up about 14% to &euro;26 billion. There has been a 15% increase in health and a 13% increase in education. Therefore, while it has been a tighter year, there is significant capacity within public expenditure for Departments and agencies to continue to run their services, schemes and programmes. However, there is not much leeway for new programmes and schemes. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made this clear on budget day and on numerous occasions since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the Taoiseach is <Col N="1073" /> being fully frank with the House. As a former Minister for Finance he is aware of the emerging situation. He stated that the Government does not wish the Exchequer to engage in borrowing. However, it is clear from the figures published on budget day that the borrowing requirement will be &euro;4 billion next year and more than &euro;5 billion the year after, with no provision made for benchmarking, another pay round or the health strategy.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that expenditure growth of more than 20% is unsustainable in the context of economic growth rates of 3.8%, 4.5% or 5%. That is not possible. The Taoiseach is misleading the country if he pretends there is no emerging fiscal crisis. He took part in this discussion yesterday and I know that those who were around the table are concerned about this issue. How is this situation to be addressed? What is the plan? Is the plan to waltz as far as the election and pretend that everything is grand, and to bring the public into the Taoiseach's confidence only when the election is over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The budgetary prospects for 2002 to 2004 were set out. Lest I be accused of not giving the figures, the forecasts for the general Government balance as a percentage of GDP for 2001 is for a surplus of 1.7%, the forecast for 2002 is for a surplus of 0.7%, the forecast for 2003 is for a deficit of 0.5% and a deficit of 0.6% in 2004. The forecasts for the Exchequer balance as a percentage of GNP is for a surplus of 0.7% in 2001, a 0.2% surplus in 2002, a deficit of 2.7% in 2003 and a deficit of 3.1% in 2004. The end of year forecasts for debt to GDP ratio are 35.8% for last year, 33.7% for this year, 33.8% for 2003 and 34.4% for 2004. Those are the published figures so there is nothing extraordinary about them.</P>
      <P>The economic outlook for the three years is for GNP growth of 3.5% this year, 4.8% next year and 4.5% in 2004, employment gains of 1.4%, 1.6% and 1.5%, an inflation rate of 4.2%, 2.8% and 2.3% and unemployment rates of 4.7%, 4.6% and 4.5%. These figures are in the public domain and are based on an economic growth that is less than the actual growth that has occurred in recent years. We are in a tighter position internationally and must be more prudent, but our growth rates are higher than the European Union and our fiscal position will be tighter. The Minister for Finance has made it clear that going by his figures we should not need any further expenditure this year. We have made it absolutely clear that we cannot have that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with one of Deputy Noonan's points. Increases of this kind in public expenditure are high. They are high because the economy is developing, because we have a large working population and because we need social inclusion measures. We have to manage the economy through a more difficult period, although it is ridiculous to speak of growth of 4% to 5% as a &ldquo;difficult period&rdquo;. However, since growth has been at <Col N="1074" /> a rate of 8.5% for a few years, people have become accustomed to that. These are the exact figures and they are all in the public domain. Clearly we must manage ourselves through the period that is ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach stick by all those figures he read out, particularly the predictions for the deficits, against the background of the decline in Government finances demonstrated by the January Exchequer figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has been in the area of finance for a number of years and would know more about these things. I am sticking to the Department of Finance figures rather than making up my own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is working with these budget day figures and will continue to work with them for the remainder of its lifetime.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to comment on the January Exchequer figures. The House will agree that commenting on one month's figures, to which we never used to give any consideration, would not be good practice. I would consider quarterly figures but not monthly figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Today, a former member of the Taoiseach's parliamentary party returned to jail for the third time. I remind the Taoiseach that the House, this time last year almost to the day, passed a motion from the Labour Party calling for the establishment of a code of conduct for Members. That was referred to the relevant committee, the Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann, and the draft prepared by the Labour Party was modified and changed because we had not suggested that our draft was a final one but rather one for consideration. That committee made a number of changes and in November last the draft code of conduct was referred to the Department of the Taoiseach, which has responsibility for its formalisation and conclusion before it is presented again to the House. In the light of the disregard that has been brought on this House by the actions of one Member, and the widespread public&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's reply to my question, and to a number of questions on this topic last year, he indicated that his Department, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the programme for social partnership, has responsibility for Oireachtas reform. This measure relates to Oireachtas reform. I wonder, <Col N="1075" /> in the light of the widespread disregard the actions of Deputy Lawlor have brought on all of us, and the necessity for the formulation of a code of conduct, if the Taoiseach could tell me where lies this code of conduct now and when it will be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, in the interests of being helpful to you and of order in the House I will reply to the supplementary question, but it has as much to do with these questions as I have to do with being premier of Australia. The committee met last week to discuss the code of practice and I understand it made some progress.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty wrapping it up, but there were legal issues in front of the committee last week that it wants to tie down. I am in agreement with finishing the code of practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I remember what I said last year and it has nothing to do with these questions. I was asked a question that was out of order, but will answer it anyway with regard to where stands the code of practice. Last week it was in front of a committee of the House for the reason that we had legal difficulties and I understand some progress was made. I do not know if it concluded it, but for my part I have no problem completing the code of practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned social inclusion to which I want to return in the context of the PPF. Is he aware from last Thursday's CSO figures for 1999 that the disposable income of a person in the southern and eastern regions is 4.1% above the State average? This corresponds very badly with the figure for the Border, midlands and west region which is 11.5% below the State average. Is this acceptable to the Taoiseach given that the gap is growing? Does it indicate that the social inclusion measures of the PPF are not being fully implemented? Given the Taoiseach's interest in social inclusion that he expressed to Deputy Noonan, where lies his strategy in regard to the matter?</P>
      <P>In relation to the make-up of the social partners, does the Taoiseach believe it was a mistake not to have included environmental experts or NGOs, given the many issues of waste, water and air quality, food safety, habitat loss and so forth which are impacting and the further impact by the economic activity which is disregarding these key factors for economic success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has rightly said, social inclusion is an area in which I am very interested. Much progress has been made in the social inclusion provisions under the PPF. These include: the social welfare and income tax pro<Col N="1076" /> visions of the last budget and all recent budgets; the publication of the national health strategy; the review of the national anti-poverty strategy which is almost completed; the consultations with the social partners which were completed yesterday; the benchmarking indexation committee which has completed its work; the target investment programmes for both rural and urban communities through the CLÁR and Rapid programmes which are under way.</P>
      <P>The point the Deputy made is precisely the one argued so strongly by me that the country be regionalised. By having a number of regions, disadvantaged regions such as the BMW region would have fiscal and direct foreign investment advantages over others. This has borne fruit with the figures for last year which showed that while employment was declining in the the BMW region, it did better than the southern and eastern regions.</P>
      <P>The sum of &euro;5.7 million has been allocated to the national anti-racism campaign. There is a consultation process for the development of the national plan for women while the action plans on homelessness have been completed in almost all of the major centres and most of the county councils. The national drugs strategy was launched last year into which all of these are feeding. Social housing provisions are being put in place. There is a White Paper on supporting voluntary activity. The Disability Authority is in place, there is a disabilities Bill, carer's benefit, teaching posts&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yesterday it was acknowledged, and warmly welcomed, at the meeting on the PPF, from the reports I received, that the distributional income effects of the last budget were four times greater for those at the bottom of the scale. While there are other issues which still have to be addressed in the context of NAPS, it is quite clear, as I am sure Deputy Sargent was about to point out, that the level of consistent poverty has more than halved in recent years.</P>

That exercise is now almost completed and I hope a report will be published in the next week or so.</P>

      <P>I do not think there has been any comprehensive discussion on it yet. As the Deputy will be aware, people are just beginning to give some thought to that process, but there has been no comprehensive discussion at this stage.</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach if it was acceptable to him that the CSO figures showed a widening gap and he did not say that it was not. He just said there were things being done. I would still like to ask him if it is acceptable and if he will answer my question in relation to the membership of the social partners to which he refers. He spoke of sustainability indicators which it would be very welcome to see, rather than just discussing them. It would also be welcome to see the membership of the social partners, including groups such as environmental experts who could make an input at the stage of planning rather than monitoring economic activity in order that it would become sustainable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>Any of the social partners can use experts. A number of them have their own experts as members or consultants. The NESC and NESF, the drivers of many of the policy initiatives and the papers used in the social partnership process, have used expert environmentalists, sociologists and others in the last 14 years. Such experts participate in producing the documents which form the basis for policy.</P>

      <P>At yesterday's meeting was there any discussion on expected job losses in the first half of this year? Was the Taoiseach given any estimate of job losses? Will he comment on their sectoral breakdown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the presentations yesterday <Col N="1078" /> there was an up-to-date report on redundancies and job losses and increases in employment which, thankfully, have also occurred. Most job losses last year occurred in ICT and related companies and the tourism sector while the increases took place in financial services and pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>The downturn began over six or seven months ago. Thankfully, the figures are remaining quite stable, but nobody likes to see people losing their jobs. A number of sectors are coping well with the difficulties that have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant State agencies are predicting significant job losses, particularly among those working for American companies which have invested here. Does the Taoiseach have in his possession a projected figure for such job losses for the first half of the year or the year as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That prediction is not correct because the figures for this year show an overall gain in employment, which will mean that 400,000 additional people will have obtained jobs here in recent years. While there will be job losses in some areas, the overall figures show we are on target for an increase in employment this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging that the current social partnership arrangements have worked relatively well in the context of developing our economy, does the Taoiseach accept that there is a perception abroad that it will be necessary to put in place new arrangements for the future? What discussions are taking place to try to formulate such arrangements? Does the Taoiseach agree that Members of the Dáil and Seanad should be involved in order that they can have an input into whatever format might be used in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's last question first, Oireachtas Members are involved in the NESF and I hope their level of attendance continues to be as good as it has been to date. The NESF challenges new policy initiatives and monitors issues of interest. There is a process in place which should be used by Oireachtas Members, perhaps to a fuller extent than is currently the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not disagree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy in his first question. Each of the social partnership agreements, from the original <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> 15 years ago through the PCW, Partnership 2000 and the PPF, has marked an evolutionary step in the process. The debate between trade unions, employers, small business interests and farmers is not whether such agreements should be reached &ndash; we have moved beyond that stage &ndash; but the form they should take. The context in which partnership agreements are reached changes with every three or four year period. It is not a question of <Col N="1079" /> whether there should be partnership between the Government of the day and the various social partners, but rather one of identifying the priorities or benchmarks that should be applied.</P>
    <P>Circumstances have changed completely since the introduction 15 years ago of the first agreement &ndash; which dealt solely with pay &ndash; to the current agreement which is quite comprehensive in nature. The social partners now work across a range of areas in a close way. When one considers the origins of this process and its current and future status it becomes evident that Ireland has developed a more sophisticated system than any of the countries from which it sought ideas 15 years ago. It would be good for the country for the process to continue to evolve in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's earlier reply to Deputy Noonan on the question of jobs, I put it to him that he is being unduly optimistic. His optimism is without foundation, particularly in the light of statements by the heads of State agencies, particularly the chief executive of IDA Ireland, Mr. Sean Dorgan. The latter indicated that we can expect a significant rise in unemployment. I put it to the Taoiseach that no one shares his optimism.</P>
      <P>In the context of yesterday's meeting, did the Taoiseach consider any reform of the industrial relations framework, with particular reference to the redundancy Acts? Does he accept that reform in this area is necessary because existing redundancy legislation is both outdated and unfair, particularly in the light of the circumstances of increased unemployment and the manner in which the redundancy Acts impinge on families?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last question, that is an issue the social partners have discussed. The Tánaiste is on record as saying she supports it.</P>
      <P>On the other issue, it is not based on anything other than the figures I quoted. I know it is inconvenient when I quote the facts rather than making up the figures. Unemployment stands at 4.7%, 4.6%, 4.5%. In real terms there is an increase in employment. Even with the tighter regime we brought in last year on work permits, the figures from Irish employers indicate that there are still 1,000 applications a week for work permits to bring people here, whom they cannot get, and long-term unemployment is now fractionally under 1.2%. Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last month was the sixth month in a row in which there was an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more people working in the economy. There have been job losses and redundancies. I do not deny that. However, the overall position is that more people are in employment and, even given the tough regime the Tánaiste brought in last year to ensure that our people would have the first choice of jobs &ndash; which I totally support &ndash; there are more than <Col N="1080" /> 1,000 applications a week from Irish employers for work permits for people from outside the country, even though they are being vetted much more strictly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach's overall description, but judging from that reply and from a reply the Taoiseach gave earlier, while employment will increase in absolute terms next year, so will the rate of unemployment relative to that for this year. There has been something of the order of 20,000 jobs lost since October last. In the context of the meeting that took place yesterday and any more plans this Government may have before the general election, is it considered that there is now a need to enhance the training provision for workers who become redundant in a range of industries whose technological base is migrating out of this economy to other countries with lower labour costs? The Taoiseach knows the litany of job losses throughout the country among those workers who have the discipline, experience and tradition of working in an industrial context. Will they receive, at a point closest to them, the training, up-skilling and other supports, including enhanced social welfare payments combined perhaps with enhanced redundancy payments, to enable them to acquire the skills in respect of which Irish employers are applying for work permits for people from outside the country as we speak? Could the Taoiseach outline precisely what concrete plans if any the Government has to deal with that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an issue. A number of measures have been discussed at length both inside and outside the social partnership process. The Lifelong Learning Task Force, which was established by the Tánaiste in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, is developing a strategic framework for lifelong learning to identify the key implementation issues the Deputy has identified. The first of those measures is the creation of a national training fund to ring fence a source of funding to undertake this task. The expert group on future skill needs has taken a very pro-active approach to identifying existing and future skill shortages and developing the means to address them. This has given rise to substantial increases in both University and FÁS training places for the ICT industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in tackling the supply constraint for off-the-job training for apprentices. FÁS is now providing approximately 8,000 phase 2 places. The enterprise led training initiative Skillnets shortly finishes its three year programme, having trained more than 12,000 people. In addition, the White Paper on adult learning contains an enormous number of recommendations, 70 or 80, geared to do exactly what the Deputy suggested, that is, to make sure that people in our existing work force who have not had adequate education are given an opportunity to receive that education and to get the necessary skills and training. In other cases, where people <Col N="1081" /> have been and are being made redundant, they can have an opportunity to get up-skilling. Those measures are in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I expect to meet President Aznar at the Barcelona European Council next month where we will discuss how to advance the process begun at Lisbon to make Europe the most dynamic, competitive, knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, with full employment and increased social cohesion. I understand that President Aznar will do the usual tour of capitals in advance of the June European Council to be held in Seville.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agenda for Barcelona has yet to be confirmed. However, Spain has set five priorities for the Barcelona European Council. These are the financial markets action plan; labour market <Col N="1082" /> mobility and the reform of the labour market; life-long education; energy liberalisation and telecommunications. The Government considered this issue before Christmas and it is clear that Ireland's priorities are strongly in line with the Spanish Presidency. At Barcelona, we will be aiming to give added impetus to the work for sustained economic growth, with increased sustainable employment opportunities and greater social cohesion. We will also be calling for tight deadlines to make the financial services internal market a reality, as this will make access to capital cheaper, give pension funds more scope for investment and profit and boost our financial services sector. We will also raise the issue of consumer protection in this sector.</P>
    <P>To date, the European Union's employment strategies have significantly contributed to reducing unemployment. At Barcelona, however, we will be calling for further advances, with increased emphasis on making firms and employees more adaptable in the face of a rapidly changing business world. To remain competitive, companies must ensure that they and their workforces remain flexible and appropriately skilled so that they are capable of meeting changing work requirements and responding to both labour shortages and bottlenecks. In-company training will be crucial in this regard and life-long education has been highlighted as critical. Life-long education is of course a central part of our domestic policies. Ongoing and detailed consideration is being given to other issues that can be progressed at Barcelona.</P>
    <P>I have no current plans to meet the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox. However, I had the opportunity to speak to him on the phone after his election as President and was delighted to be able to congratulate him on what is an outstanding achievement both for him personally and for this country. The success of Pat Cox demonstrates that the smaller nations can have a key role to play in the institutions of Europe and that Ireland is playing its part to the full in building and developing the European Union. Pat Cox's success and other recent high-level appointments of Irish officials in the EU Commission shows that Ireland punches far above its weight on the European stage.</P>
    <P>While I have no plans at present to meet the President of the European Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, I will of course meet him at the Barcelona and Seville European Councils. I have not met any of the European heads of state since the Laeken European Council in December last. With regard to the questions tabled on the Laeken European Council, I refer the Deputies to my statement to the House on 30 January last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government made a final decision on Ireland's participation in the convention and the nomination process for the three members of that convention &ndash; two from the Oireachtas and one from the Government &ndash; which was agreed at Laeken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1083" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has agreed the Government nominations. It has not finalised the others because that is a matter to be discussed in the Oireachtas between the Ceann Comhairle and the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, will the Taoiseach make it clear that the former Commissioner, at present an active member of the Fianna Fáil Party, Mr. Ray MacSharry, who has been nominated by the Government, will be seen by all in the House as the Fianna Fáil nominee? Will he make it clear that the Labour Party and Fine Gael will have nominees from this House and that that is the intention of the Government? Mr. MacSharry will be seen as a Fianna Fáil nominee on behalf of the Government and the next two parties of size in this House should be the parties which will nominate their members to attend the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that Mr. MacSharry, with his knowledge and experience, will be seen as representing the country in that job. That is the Government's wish and it wishes him well in that position. His alternate is Mr. Bobby McDonagh of the Department of Foreign Affairs who has been a considerable expert at Intergovernmental Conferences over a number of years and the author of a book on the Treaty of Amsterdam. We have tried to pick two people from the Government who would have the prestige, qualifications and dedication to give a commitment. I very much appreciate that Mr. MacSharry set aside commercial and other activities in his own life to give the necessary time to this. It will be time consuming.</P>
      <P>I hear what Deputy Quinn says on the other matter and I have spoken to my Whip about it. I hope that the Whips can resolve it. I am anxious to ensure that the House is well represented. Needless to say, there have been many representations, which we must consider, from those on the other side of the Nice referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Quinn's request to the Taoiseach. I would like him to treat the request seriously at the Whips' meetings and not just fob it off to these meetings for parking purposes. The Taoiseach, in his initial reply, talked about the ambition of Europe to be a modern, knowledge-based, industrial economy. Is the Taoiseach aware that the lack of roll-out of broadband facilities in Ireland is now a matter of serious concern? Is he particularly aware that we are third from the bottom of a league of OECD countries in the roll-out of broadband facilities? Is he aware that it takes five times as much money to transmit an item of data from Limerick, Cork or Galway to Dublin than to transmit similar data from Dublin to New York? How can the rest of the country, outside the greater Dublin area, be promoted for industrial purposes when there is such a divergence in cost of the transmission of data and any company involved in data <Col N="1084" /> transmission which wants to locate in Ireland is almost forced to do so in the greater Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reply to the first question. I would have thought my reply was sufficiently serious to make it clear that I was not fobbing anything off. I was merely making the point that there is a very sizeable portion of the population which does not see its European view reflected by the main parties in the House. It is also making a very active campaign about representation. It is an issue to which we must give some consideration. I do not either support it or reject it at this stage. It has been put in writing by at least one party in the House, not to mind the ones outside it.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that Deputy Noonan has raised the matter of the broadband with me. Broadband divides into three separate areas. There is the international element of it and we stand very highly on the connection with Global Crossing and others outside the country. Secondly, on a regional basis, the broad band is processed out around the country and we stand very highly on that also. The major problem is in the third part &ndash; the final connection. Those in the ICT call it &ldquo;the last mile&rdquo;. We are not in a good position here because when the issue came up, some years ago, the private sector made it very clear to the Government and to the State agencies that it required the liberalisation of the telecoms market and the State to enter into international and regional agreements. It indicated that it would take up the third part and there would be huge competition between private sector companies to do so. When it came to that stage the private sector was not there and has no interest whatever in taking up the third part.</P>
      <P>That is how this issue came about. There is no use arguing over spilt milk but that is what happened. This is now accepted by the private interests in this area. I spoke to them about it a number of times recently. Deputy Noonan raised the matter with me. He said I should take it up with them and I did so. The Information Society Commission and the Minister for Public Enterprise have contacted all interested parties and asked them to co-operate with the State and its agencies to find a resolution to this issue. There is no point in the different bodies arguing, we must see how best we can meet this challenge.</P>
      <P>There are two different fora &ndash; one convened by the ITC sectors of IBEC to examine how they can help, and the other by the Minister, who has called in a number of experts in this field from within and outside the State, to see how we can deal with the issue. This must be dealt with and it will not be unless the State takes some direct involvement, something that could be costly. The private sector is not investing in the infrastructure as it appeared would be the case some years ago. To make progress, the State must take the initiative.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, <Col N="1085" /> whatever his intentions, Mr. MacSharry, that eminent former Member of this House, has remained an active member of Fianna Fáil until this day and that under no circumstances could his appointment by the Government be seen as representing all the political forces in the Oireachtas? I say formally, as the leader of the party that proposed the Forum on Europe and that played an active part in the campaign for the Treaty of Nice, that the Labour Party expects to have a nominee from this Parliament in that convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It costs five times more to transfer an item of data from Cork, Limerick or Galway to Dublin than it does to transfer that item of data from Dublin to the United States. That spells disaster for anywhere outside Dublin as a location for modern industry. The Taoiseach must introduce a strategy on this.</P>
      <P>I agree with the analysis that the private sector made commitments on which it did not deliver and, in retrospect, even though it was wise to sell Eircom as a company, there would have been merit in holding on to the infrastructure when the company was sold to provide the broadband facility. The Taoiseach is obliged to put a strategy in place to ensure we are not at the bottom of the list for broadband facilities in Europe. If it is Europe's objective to have a modern, knowledge-based, industrial economy, we must share that objective and we cannot do so while broadband access is so inadequate everywhere outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention at the outset was to make sure we would not be in that position. It is vital to the economy and to the State that we have broadband access. If we are to provide that we must have these discussions, both with IBEC and other main players, and with others who have stated a view.</P>
      <P>The necessary infrastructure will not be put in place by the private sector and we must look at alternatives, such as public-private partnerships. As a result of other difficulties the international telecom markets have faced and because of third generation mobile phones, the capital required in the State for this investment is unlikely to come from those companies, so the State will have to be directly involved. The Minister for Public Enterprise and the Information Society Commission are engaged in formulating a plan to deal with the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many firms are facing and of the problems this is creating for them.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents us and our Department from intervening in relation to premium levels or in respect of the risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims in Ireland, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the effects of the 11 September attacks in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, who had a significant presence in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board. I am confident the establishment of that board will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board has been charged with advising us on motor insurance costs and, in particular, with examining the relationship between the incidence of claims and the premiums charged for various classes of policyholder identified by age and sex. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. I expect to receive the final report of the board in the next month. In light of its recommendations, the Government and I will consider what further action is appropriate and necessary.</P>
      <P>A workplace safety group has been established with a view to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. Its objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return to the workplace at the earliest possible date and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The group is developing proposals at present designed to bring the initiative to small and medium sized firms.</P>
      <P>I encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways to reduce the worst effects of the current circumstances, for example, by better management of risks, examination of excess cover and whether the full extent of the cover included in policies is actually required by individuals and companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I again record my disappointment that the Minister has not seen fit to take charge of this most important issue, particularly with regard to the litany of failures on the part of <Col N="1088" /> the Minister of State. He, his party and his Government colleagues have no idea of the extent of the problem of the high cost of insurance.</P>
      <P>Is he aware that jobs are being lost as we speak because of insurance premia going through the roof? Is he aware of increases in excess of 100% on business in particular? Is he aware that manufacturers are withdrawing from insurance plans because of the disincentive of the cost and the consequences thereof?</P>
      <P>Every item included in the Minister of State's reply formed part of his response to a similar question last year. No progress has been reported. In view of this will he indicate why he does not immediately refer this matter to the Competition Authority under section 11 of the 1991 Act?</P>
      <P>Insurers and consumers have paid a 2% levy on premiums for the past 15 years. What is the annual amount levied, how much is in the accrual fund and what does the Minister of State intend to do with it? Will he also outline why the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is not in operation, despite promises by him and the Minister that it would be dealing with employers liability cases in early 2002? Will he indicate the strict timeframe within which the body will operate?</P>

      <P>I refute what the Deputy has said. We are fully aware of the situation. I have spent much of my time over the past few years working on this issue. I have dealt at length with the various crises that have emerged, including that created by the Independent Insurance Company Limited situation and the fall-out of 11 September. We have worked assiduously to ensure that the information required by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board will be made available. I have co-operated with the board to ensure it concludes its work and I am confident it will produce a report we can address.</P>

In response the Minister of State asked the Deputy to provide him with information on such companies. Why would he seek it? It appears he does not know that such insurance is not mandatory.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain to the House why the report by the MIAB was not produced last year, as he assured the House it would be? He now assures the House it will be produced within one month and he referred to it as a final report. Does that mean he has received an interim or draft report and, if so, is that why material from the report appeared in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on 25 January?</P>
      <P>Apart from telling Deputy Flanagan that he has dealt with these crises at great length, what has the Minister of State produced in consequence? Is it not the case that, on average, the cost of employers and public liability insurance increased by 42% last year and it is forecast to increase by up to 55% this year, and that many companies, especially small ones, cannot absorb the cumulative impact of such increases? Will he indicate the tangible conclusions for these companies that have emerged from his dealing with these crises?</P>

      <P>I deal with the insurance industry on a regular basis. As an example of what I have been doing to address these crises, last June, on a bank holiday in the UK, the Independent Insurance Company Limited went bankrupt. The following day my Department was notified and we received 17 calls from 17 big companies in this country which had no insurance cover and faced the threat of bankruptcy. The following day I called in the Irish Insurance Federation and persuaded it to give cover to companies it had not covered for up to seven years. We saved those companies and maintained employment in them. We have also worked carefully with the professional bodies and various business organisations over the past year to put together the necessary information to address the serious consequences of this situation. On different occasions I have requested information on different aspects of it but to date I have not been furnished with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of reports of increases in the price of goods and services in the changeover to the euro. I am also aware that some prices have gone down, for example, public transport fares. I have repeatedly said that the introduction of the euro should not, of itself, require any trader to increase prices. However, prices increase all the time for legitimate reasons unconnected with the introduction of the euro and it is not clear that the rate of increase during the changeover period has been greater than it would otherwise have been. The consumer price index figures for October, November and December do not support suggestions that there were widespread, excessive increases in the run-up to the changeover. We will have to await the January figures to assess the position immediately following the changeover.</P>
      <P>With regard to price monitoring, my Department does not have a role in this respect but the Director of Consumer Affairs has undertaken to closely monitor the CSO figures in the period surrounding the changeover and I will be maintaining on-going contact with her to ascertain any trends that may emerge. More generally, price control as a policy mechanism has not been pursued by any Government since the 1980s. Successive Governments since then have recognised that the encouragement of a competitive environment and promotion of greater price awareness is a much better way of ensuring value for money for consumers than the imposition of price controls. The introduction of the euro does not change this fact. There are legitimate grounds for price increases and it is a matter for the suppliers of goods and services, or the associations that represent them, to explain the basis for such increases as have occurred.</P>
      <P>I urge consumers to be assertive in seeking explanations for price increases that they do not feel are justified. Consumers need to realise the power they have if they feel that they are not being treated fairly and that is to take their business elsewhere. Loss of business is the ultimate sanction for any trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has suggested that monopolies and cartels are not responsible for price disparity and has said we can compare like with like but in doing so we must be selective. Does he not agree that other factors in this country must also be considered, including the costs of higher VAT, commercial rates, rents, wages, traffic congestion, distribution, poor infrastructure and imports? In addition there is an added cost of 4% on transactions from meeting the demands of Government red tape on business. <Col N="1092" /> Does the Minister of State agree that all these costs are one of the main reasons for the increase in inflation in the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a related matter, that we can now compare prices across the euro zone. That is the most important development so far as the consumer's interest is concerned. I have been endeavouring to mobilise and energise the consumer voice and we now see on a daily basis the findings of surveys carried out by newspapers and others. On foot of this, I have asked Forfás to officially carry out comprehensive and reliable research and provide information for me as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs. I look forward to its report. In carrying out this survey and important work, which is unprecedented, it will have to refer to the issues raised by the Deputy, including the costs that employers claim they have, which I have heard representatives of the Small Firms Association and others detail. I remind the Deputy that the Government has endeavoured to reduce tax rates in general for workers and create the right environment for employers. This has been central to its economic policy. The regime applied by it is fair in relation to that in other countries. While there are many issues, I want reliable facts from this important research. Clearly, we welcome the findings of surveys that have been carried out, but this research will give us comprehensive and reliable information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to something that is happening as we speak in Europe in relation to Commissioner Monti's proposals to end some restrictions in this area. As the Minister of State who represents the Government at internal market level and as one who has worked with Commissioner Monti, I welcome the fact that we can compare like with like. I acknowledge that tax levels, VRT and VAT, are high here, but they are higher still in Denmark. What is happening at Commission level is relevant to this debate. It will give the consumer a chance to see precisely what he or she is paying. Consumers will also realise that the tax regime in place for personal and other taxes is favourable. While I accept there are issues to be addressed, this is not my responsibility. Clearly, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is the person who deals with this area. There are issues of transparency and openness, which I welcome. That Commissioner Monti is endeavouring to open up the system and ease restrictions is welcome.</P>

      <P>The euro has been in circulation for the past six weeks and there have been many claims of price increases. The Minister of State told us in November that the Director of Consumer Affairs would closely monitor prices, that <Col N="1093" /> she had a code of good practice in place and would name and shame any company which did not comply. Has the Director of Consumer Affairs reported to the Minister of State on any incidence of overpricing or excessive profiteering? If and when the Minister of State is in a position to look at the final outcome of the introduction of the euro, will he consider, in the event of excessive price increases, putting in place price controls or price freezes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has not had to name and shame any particular retailer. The amount of preparatory work done by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and retailers and the training provided, assisted by Forfás, was admired by all concerned. Everyone appreciates that a good job was done. The Government has to work with the facts. The consumer price index figures showed that there was an increase of 0.5% in December, which compares with an increase of 0.1% in December of the previous year, as a result of which annual inflation rose to 4.2%. In November the consumer price index increased by 0.1% which compares with an increase of 0.4% in the previous year. The other month for which we have relevant figures is October when the consumer price index increased by 0.3%. Obviously, there will be unscrupulous retailers who will take advantage. We are conscious of this. However, we have to deal with reality. The figures we are working with show that retailers have not taken advantage of the changeover. That was the issue at stake. The Director of Consumer Affairs had a job of work to do. We had a voluntary code of practice in place which was of tremendous help. Dual pricing was the key element of the campaign so far as the Government and the Director of Consumer Affairs were concerned.</P>
      <P>To respond to the Deputy's last question, the Government has no plans to re-establish price orders. We did it once in relation to the drinks industry when the rate of inflation was an issue. The whole approach of the Government has been correct in providing a competitive economy. I welcome the fact that the introduction of the euro has given consumers a chance to compare prices across the euro zone and I am actively involved in trying to exploit this new situation in their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State saying that since 1 January there have not been excessive price increases? What consumers are saying and what we are hearing all the time &ndash; I have experience of this &ndash; is that prices have increased. The Minister of State says he has received no reports of price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly saying that the figures for December, November and October show there has been no widespread abuse of the changeover period. The consumer price index remained relatively stable. In some cases there have been <Col N="1094" /> price increases. Obviously, the Deputy and I will get reports about various unscrupulous retailers during the period. I accept there is a separate issue of comparative pricing across the euro zone and have gone on record as saying there is an issue that needs to be addressed, but this is not a question of retailers taking advantage of the euro changeover. Before and since its introduction there is an issue that needs to be addressed. I have acknowledged this by asking Forfás to carry out indepth research. I look forward to receiving its report.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the changes to the work permit regime introduced with effect from 2 January 2002 constitute an appropriate response to the changed labour market situation resulting from the general slowdown in economies worldwide, the aftermath of the events of 11 September and their impact on the Irish economy. The new procedures are designed to verify that employers are making all reasonable efforts to recruit locally or through the wider EEA market before looking to employ non-EEA nationals by obliging employers to register job vacancies with FÁS before making a work permit application. These new arrangements came into operation on 2 January 2002, and as notified vacancies can take some four to six weeks to process through FÁS, it is too early yet to tell how effective the new system is in sourcing Irish-EEA staff.</P>
      <P>I will monitor closely the implementation of the new procedures in the next few months. Any further proposals for change in this area will be informed by operational experience in that regard.</P>

      <P>A few minutes ago the issue of price increases following the introduction of the euro was discussed. The Minister has increased the work permit fee from £125 to &euro;400 from 2 January. Will she explain the reason for this increase to the House? Those paying the fee are employers. We heard earlier &ndash; even though the Minister of State does not appear to be fully aware of the position &ndash; about the pressures they are under to renew their insurance. Now they are being hit again. Will the Minister justify the increase of 150% in the work permit fee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exempt from the need to register with FÁS are the medical, construction and high-tech sectors. Will the Minister consider adding to the list the horse racing industry which offers a specialised form of employment and is a worldwide industry? <Col N="1095" /> I have received representations from persons involved in the industry which suggest work permits are not being renewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Strong representations have been made by many Deputies on behalf of the horse racing industry. In recent weeks I received more representations about the industry than any other sector. It is, therefore, very well represented in the House. I am not considering expanding the categories covered by the working visa to the industry. Applications from the sector will be examined on a case by case basis. Permits are being renewed where there is a genuine need and employees cannot be found locally.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increase in the permit fee, some sources recommended raising it to &euro;3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Permit fees are much higher in many other countries. The purpose of the increase is to try to make the process more difficult in order that employers will seek local labour. Some have suggested that because employers were not paying market rates, they were finding it difficult to recruit local labour, either in Ireland or the wider European economic area.</P>
      <P>The fee has not been increased for a considerable time. The processing procedure is huge becausemany civil servants are needed to make sure the data given by employers are correct. This is necessary because examples arose of people being brought here, who were not treated properly. We go to considerable lengths to ensure the employees concerned are paid the going rate and have the same conditions as employees from Ireland, other European Union member states and the EEA.</P>
      <P>The process consumes a considerable amount of manpower. Officials in my Department have been working Saturdays and Sundays processing applications which has created a huge overtime cost. In Christmas week alone we received almost 2,000 applications &ndash; the exact figure was 1,920. The purpose of the new regime is to make the process more difficult because the first priority of a Minister or Government is to ensure local people can find employment.</P>
      <P>At Question Time Deputy Noonan referred to the recent increase in unemployment from 3.6% to 4.3%. We introduced the stricter regime for work permits in response. When I took office four years ago we were granting about 2,000 to 2,500 work permits a year. Last year we granted something in the order of 35,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employers do not always require people for the whole year. For example, there were cases of <Col N="1096" /> people being recruited for particularly busy periods such as Christmas. Therefore, the charges for permits are skewed month by month, in order that the fee for a person coming here for a five month period will be &euro;150 as it would be unfair to charge &euro;400. We gave much thought to the increase, which is not related to the euro. I was not translating £125 into &euro;400.</P>

      <P>The facts speak for themselves, it happened at the same time. There is a great deal of disquiet in the catering business concerning the fact that CERT brought people here without a work permit and allowed them to work for several months. Will the Minister comment on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is entitled to bring in people from outside the EEA area without a work permit. While CERT is not part of my ministerial responsibilities, I am aware that several matters have arisen which are being examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a substantial programme of legislation reflecting the broad spectrum of my departmental responsibilities which I propose to progress in the coming months with the continuing co-operation of the Houses and the office of the parliamentary counsel to the Government. A key priority is enactment of the Competition Bill introduced in the Seanad in December 2001. The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate and modernise the existing enactments relating to competition and mergers. The Bill will introduce significant changes arising mainly from the work of the competition and mergers review group, but also changes which take account of other developments such as the proposed alterations to the implementation of EU competition law in the member states.</P>
      <P>The Whistleblowers Protection Bill was introduced in the Dáil as a Private Members' Bill by Deputy Rabbitte. The purpose of the Bill is to provide protection from civil liability to employees who make certain disclosures &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo; in relation to the conduct of the business affairs of their employers. The Bill is with the office of the parliamentary counsel with a view to progressing work on a substantial number of amendments as approved by Government. Once the amendments are received from the office of the parliamentary counsel, I will seek Dáil time to proceed with Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Patents (Amendment) Bill was published <Col N="1097" /> in December 1999. Its main purpose is to bring the Patents Act, 1992, into line with the WTO agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights. Second Stage of the Bill was completed on 16 November 2000. I hope to have certain amendments approved by the Government and drafted by the parliamentary counsel to enable the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved draft heads of the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Bill, which is with the office of the parliamentary counsel for drafting. The main purpose of the proposed Bill is to facilitate structural change in the food industry through relaxing the majority voting requirements for the amalgamation of co-operatives.</P>
    <P>In December 2001 the Government approved the drafting of the Companies (Amendment) (Audit) Bill. This Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the review group on auditing. It will cover the establishment of the Irish auditing and accountancy supervisory authority, measures to strengthen the regulation of auditors, and application of the EU Council regulation on insolvency. This morning the Government approved the drafting of the Late Payment in Commercial Transactions Bill which will implement the EU directive, the key impact of which is to extend prompt payment legislation from the public sector to all sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>I will shortly bring draft heads to Government in relation to two further Bills: the Work Permits Bill, which will provide a clear statutory basis for the issuing of employment permits and the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill, which will establish the foundation as a separate legal entity. I will also be progressing a comprehensive programme of secondary legislation, including the transposition of EU directives, over the coming months.</P>

She supplied work permits to a large number of workers in the economy at a time when it was considered they were needed.

      <P>For the second time in answer to this question &ndash; Deputy Rabbitte asked questions earlier which I answered &ndash; there was a major problem in getting raw data information from the insurance industry. We fought very hard to get that information over the past year. The final information was made available in early December. The board asked for further time to conclude its work. It is working assiduously on that and has given me an assurance that it expects to conclude the report within a month. I am prepared to wait until I get a final report. I am fully aware of the problems in the insurance industry. <Col N="1101" /> I have done everything possible in recent years to see what alternatives we could put up to provide alternative cover for young people.

Is he aware of the disquiet among thousands of young people, particularly in rural areas, annually when their premium comes up for renewal that they can be asked any premium the insurance company so wishes and that £3,000 is the norm which is totally out of line with young people's incomes and something they cannot afford?

Is it not blatantly obvious that subsequent to the interim report, it took until December 2001 for the insurance industry to provide that raw data?

      <P>It is true. I am not questioning the veracity of it &ndash; it is obviously true. If he says the report has been held up by obstruction by the insurance industry in providing raw data, why did he side with the insurance industry when the interim report from the MIAB came out under the Freedom of Information Act challenging the traditional view of the insurance industry? Why did the Minister of State line up behind it? Why has he difficulty understanding why Members on this side of the House would want to see some relief for young drivers who are being required to pay more in insurance cover in many cases than is the worth of the car they are insuring? Why is he surprised that Members on this side of the House want to see that tackled, irrespective of what reports are, or are not, in gestation? Has the Minister of State come to the conclusion, after four and a half years, that there is nothing he can do, for various reasons, to contribute to an alleviation of this problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, nor have I said that. I am awaiting this report. There is an excellent group of people on that board which represents every public service organisation and Department relevant to motoring and motor insurance. It is a powerful board made up of eminent people and I am confident that its report will pinpoint ways in which we can take certain measures. Some of those measures might not be palatable and this House may be asked to take decisions it does not like as a result of those recommendations, but we <Col N="1103" /> hope we will have full consensual commitment across the House to ensuring that the necessary conclusions will be implemented in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has a wonderful way of using words to suit occasions, but I did not side with the insurance industry when the interim report was published. I directed that the interim report be provided. I expected a report to be produced in June 2000. I was asked to extend the time, but I said I could not do that unless a report was put before me. An interim report was put before me but I was told it was totally inconclusive. I am quite clear that the interim report was inconclusive because we did not have the raw data. We sought to get that. It has not been done before in this country and now that we have it, I await its outcome.</P>

Why has he allowed a cartel to operate not only in regard to young drivers &ndash; that is only one issue &ndash; but in terms of household and business insurance? Why do we not have competition now that we are in the euro zone? Why has the Minister not invited or encouraged insurance companies abroad to come here, which would create competition? The industry is totally without competition. It is a cartel.</P>

      <P>As a result of the appointment of a receiver on 13 December 2001, the company was advertised for sale in the media in January 2002. The receiver has sent out 20 brochures in response to inquiries received. Three interested investors have visited the company in recent weeks and one of these is sending back a team for further discussions next week. The outcome of these and other such visits will determine the future of the company.</P>
      <P>I visited the company on 22 January to assess the situation on the ground and to meet the receiver, the managing director of the company, the trade union representatives and staff of the company. I am pleased the receiver has been able to ensure that the company will maintain employment until the end of March, which will facilitate the search for a new owner.</P>
      <P>My Department and Enterprise Ireland will remain in close contact with the company and the receiver to facilitate any potential take over or restructuring of the company.</P>

Has she further information to give the House or the workers on the length of time the company will continue to trade pending a determination on the future of the company? Has she positive news about any other industry that might take up slack that may come from redundancies from Wexford Electronics?</P>

      <P>I have not spoken to the receiver <Col N="1105" /> since then but I am aware Enterprise Ireland representatives have done so. The company will only say it will trade until the end of March. Obviously, an extension of that period would depend on the interest of the company with which it is currently in discussion. If there was a successful acquisition of this company. I am confident the company would continue to trade in the intervening period while that is being finalised, but the receiver is only in a position to trade for the next eight weeks until there is a firm indication of a successful interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to No. 22. The Taoiseach is well aware of the controversy in the House last week as a result of Deputy Noel O'Flynn's outrageous and inflammatory remarks. A fund-raising event for Deputy O'Flynn in his constituency was subsequently honoured with the presence of the Minister for Finance. It seems the Taoiseach is being very fair in the House, but that Fianna Fáil is operating a strategy in constituencies to attempt to play both sides of the immigrant issue. The Taoiseach will recall that all party leaders signed a pledge which stated that race would not be allowed to become an election issue. I ask the Taoiseach to agree that the pledge should be signed by all candidates, including Deputies and Senators. I will withdraw my opposition to the Order of Business if the Taoiseach agrees that candidates from the main parties should guarantee not to use race as an issue in the general election. If not, there will be a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the Labour Party's objections to taking the proposal under the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam in committee, particularly in view of Deputy Noel O'Flynn's racist comments in this House last Thursday. The Taoiseach indicated in reply to a question I asked him last week that he does not agree with Deputy O'Flynn's remarks, that he regrets the remarks and that he feels they should not have been made. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated that he supports the Taoiseach's statements on Deputy O'Flynn's opinions as confirmed in this House on Thursday and reiterated over the weekend. It is inexplicable, therefore, that the Minister for Finance should endorse Deputy O'Flynn's political stance by attending a function in Cork, held exclusively to raise funds for Deputy O'Flynn. The actions of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, have raised serious questions. I do not believe, therefore, that the matter should be referred to a committee. If racists in the Fianna Fáil Party wish to use the race card and feel free to do so, we should have such a debate in this House. This issue is being raised in the aftermath of the murder of a Chinese man, killed on the streets of this city for no reason other than his ethnic origin. The comments of Deputy O'Flynn and others will lead to further deaths unless affirmative and clear moral <Col N="1108" /> leadership is demonstrated by the Taoiseach and the President of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>The issue before the House is to refer a proposal to a committee, but it is being used as an excuse to raise another matter. On Thursday morning I made clear my feelings about Deputy O'Flynn's remarks. I have read the comments he made in the House later on Thursday and I do not believe they should be put in the same context as the earlier remarks, as he was trying to get his views across the floor. If one looks at the text of his statement, one will see that he was talking about the overall issue of crime.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that last week I asked him to participate in an all-party motion condemning Deputy Lawlor for his lack of co-operation with the Flood Tribunal. The Taoiseach assented and subsequently at Whips' discussions it was decided a motion requesting the Deputy's resignation would be the only adequate action on this occasion. Since then there has been a letter from Deputy Lawlor in which he objects to the taking of such a motion in his absence. He claims it would lack fairness and balance and that the Dáil would appear to be acting as judge, jury and executioner in his case. I understand there is legal advice emerging now, advising that the Dáil cannot debate such a motion in the absence of Deputy Lawlor. I ask the Taoiseach to request that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform make all the necessary arrangements to have Deputy Lawlor appear here for the debate on Thursday, to give him an opportunity to say what he wants to say on the record of the House, and return him to Mountjoy when the debate is completed. Otherwise, the intention of this House will be frustrated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to what has been said to Deputy Noonan on behalf of Fine Gael, does the Taoiseach still hold the view, one year on from 30 January 2001, that, as he said in a statement at the time, the High Court judgment amounts to a challenge and an opportunity for Deputy Lawlor to avail of its terms to put right the wrong that was done? The Taoiseach said that, as suggested by the Government's motion, the challenge to Deputy Lawlor contained in the High Court judgment concerning him was one to which he must rise and that if he did not intend to comply with the letter of the law and the spirit of the Constitution as laid down in the judgment, he would demonstrate such defiance of constitutional values as would justify the other Members of the House publicly and solemnly expressing their opinion that his role as a public representative was not tenable. One year on, and into Deputy Lawlor's third commitment to jail for contempt of the orders of the court and the tribunal, does the Taoiseach still hold these views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government position on this issue is, as it has been for the past year and longer, that the Flood Tribunal was established by the unanimous will of the Members of this House and that every citizen and every Member of the Oireachtas has a legal, moral and democratic duty to co-operate with the tribunal, not to obstruct it and to comply with its lawful orders. That is the legal position and I would expect any citizen or Member who disputed the validity or legality of the tribunal to make his or her case to the tribunal and, if necessary, to the court. That is where these things have to be argued out. The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1997, has been invoked by the tribunal to compel Deputy Lawlor to comply with its orders. That is the stated position of the courts. Under the legislation introduced by this Government and passed by this House, anyone can be compelled, without criminal proceedings and by a fast-track process, to obey the lawful orders of the tribunal or be committed to jail for contempt. Deputy Lawlor has not complied and is paying the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the Whips are meeting later today to agree on a motion to be taken here on Thursday morning after the Order of Business. I agree with that motion. I have no legal advice, at this stage, that we should not debate the matter. I have heard people express the view that a Member should have an entitlement to be here. I am not a legal person &ndash; there are plenty of them in the House &ndash; but I am not sure how a person who is in jail by order of the court can be here. I am not sure, either, whether it is appropriate for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to <Col N="1113" /> get involved. That needs to be considered very carefully.</P>
    <P>However, as I understand the rules of the House &ndash; it has always been the advice to the House &ndash; it can pass a motion or express a view. Perhaps in these circumstances that may be more difficult, since it is a Member of the House on which we are expressing a view and that person can not exercise his rights, but I do not have, apart from having heard a number of people comment on possible difficulties, any advice to the contrary. The matter will have to be considered but the Whips are meeting in an hour to agree the motion, which will be taken here on Thursday. We can check the legality of the motion but I understand the Government Whip asked the advice of the parliamentary legal adviser and I do not think she has any difficulty with that proceeding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it the Taoiseach is making a commitment to the House that a motion calling on Deputy Lawlor to resign from the House will be debated here on Thursday, that this will be taken in Deputy Lawlor's absence and that if there is a legal difficulty about Deputy Lawlor not being present, the Taoiseach will make arrangements to ensure his presence?</P>

I told Deputy Noonan that I understood the Whips were agreeing a motion, that whatever motion the Whips agreed on would be taken on Thursday morning and that I did not see any difficulty with our taking the motion unless there is legal advice indicating otherwise. I am not sure whether the Government of the day can assume the power to act in this way when the courts have stated that a Member of the House is to be jailed. I do not know whether we have the power to do that.</P>

      <P>My question is on a separate and totally unrelated matter but one of interest to an enormous number of people across the country. I have been in some ten constituencies since 10 January this year and on most occasions I visited schools. In every school it was brought to my attention, either by the principal or the parents association or by some of the teachers directly involved, that commitments in respect of their capital building programme have been put on hold. Their efforts and that of the people acting on their behalf to get clarity from Tullamore have come to naught. They have been told by the Department that even it does not know exactly what is happening as everything has been put on hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On three occasions, 4 and 12 December last and 31 January this year, my colleague Deputy Shortall, attempted to get a detailed list of the 850 schools, both primary and secondary, from the Minister for Education and Science. They are <Col N="1114" /> at various stages in the Department's building unit in Tullamore. She inquired as to their status and when they will be able to proceed to the next stage.</P>
    <P>In one case there is a school that hired and financed the renting of temporary prefab accommodation to enable it to move out of the dilapidated school building in which it was located so as to enable remedial work to commence but it has not yet got the go-ahead for that project. That is just one illustration of the many cases there are. No doubt the Taoiseach is able to outline the current situation from his own experience of constituency visits.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach authorise or direct the Minister for Education and Science to publish the full list of the 850 schools, the various stages at which their applications currently rest and what the capital allocation will be this year? Can we have that now rather than in a couple of weeks before polling day on 9 May?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why the schools repair and building programme is in such a shambles? Has it collapsed under the weight of political promises in the various constituencies? Is the Taoiseach aware how dire the situation has become in some counties?</P>
      <P>Last week I visited a very well-run gaelscoil in Wicklow. It is currently housed in a former funeral home and the big double doors are still in the front of one classroom. How can the Taoiseach stand over these facilities? What is happening in the Department of Education and Science where no school seems to be making any progress in terms of its repair or building programme?</P>

      <P>I repeat once again the request made by Deputy Shortall on 4 and 12 December last and on 31 January this year. I remind the Taoiseach that a specific commitment was given by the relevant Minister who shares collective Cabinet responsibility with the rest of his colleagues on the Front Bench that a full list will be made available. This is not Fianna Fáil money, it is taxpayers' money that was voted in this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that over the past five or six years there has been a wonderful increase in resources and that we have been able to allocate funding to a variety of different projects. The net question I am asking the Taoiseach now is if he will honour the pledge or direct the Minister for Education and Science to honour the pledge to simply tell us what the list is, what the state of play is in respect of some 850 schools? The parents, teachers and local communities should know the facts. Will the Taoiseach honour that commitment to give the facts in regard to the sum of money that has been allocated? Where is it to be spent, how is it to be spent and when is it to be spent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express sympathy on my behalf and that of the Government to everyone affected by flooding in recent days. It has been a very traumatic time for everyone affected and was particularly serious in a number of areas in Dublin.</P>
      <P>While it is too early to be definitive about the causes of flooding in individual locations, it is clear that an unusual combination of factors contributed to the unexpected severity and speed with which it occurred. On Friday, 1 February, we had high spring tides, gale force southerly winds, very heavy rain and a drop in atmospheric pressure. This is an infrequent combination of events.</P>
      <P>The Government accepts that great hardship has been caused to people as a result and has decided that a humanitarian aid scheme will be made available. The Office of Public Works has been in contact with the Red Cross to implement this scheme. As on previous occasions, most recently following the flooding of November 2000, I am confident that the Red Cross will implement this scheme speedily and sympathetically. I remind the House that the scheme put in place in November 2000 was implemented very effectively. The Red Cross assessed and made payments in 447 cases within eight weeks of receipt of applications. The total amount paid out in that instance was &euro;3.49 million. In general, the criteria used in assessing eligibility for aid are homelessness, damage to homes, serious injury, or loss of income.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the response of relevant authorities to the flooding at the weekend was speedy and efficient. My officials in the Office of Public Works visited some of the worst affected areas on Saturday and Sunday, 2 and 3 February, to assess the extent of the damage. The resources of Dublin City Council emergency services are in place to provide an effective response to flood events. Dublin City Council decided to activate the major emergency plan to deal with the flooding of 1 February and the resources of Dublin City Council, the Garda Síochána, the Army, the Civil Defence, the Dublin Fire Brigade and the Eastern Regional Health Authority were mobilised. A co-ordinating group based in the Civic Offices allocated tasks to the various agencies and met every hour to deal with issues that arose. The group will also be involved in a review of the response of the emergency services to this flooding.</P>
      <P>As stated earlier, the flooding in this instance appears to have been caused by a most unusual combination of factors. Notwithstanding this, the Office of Public Works is in contact with local authorities with a view to examining the precise causes of flooding in each location and to ascertain what preventative measures may be feasible. The Office of Public Works is available to provide assistance to local authorities where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the flooding at Foynes, County Limerick, my officials in the Office of Public <Col N="1124" /> Works will examine the causes of the flooding in conjunction with the local authority to determine whether measures can be taken to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that I should first declare an interest in this matter. My mother-in-law, who lives with us in a &ldquo;granny&rdquo; flat in Strand Road, was made homeless and the basement of our house was flooded in an incredibly short period. Everything happened within about an hour of my first receiving a telephone call to return home. While everyone would have liked the response of the emergency services and, in particular, Dublin City Council to have been faster, from what I saw in Irishtown on Saturday morning &ndash; I was unable to get there on Friday because I was bailing out the basement of our house &ndash; corporation officials responded as quickly as I have seen them move on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, on foot of which a number of questions arise. First, the issue of poor electrification is a key problem in terms of the restoration of people to their homes. I am assured by Frank Lambe of Dublin City Council that in respect of the areas of Irishtown, Ringsend and Sandymount, those in need of alternative accommodation have been identified and that such accommodation has been found. However, a number of difficulties are bound to arise. For example, if people do not have insurance on their houses &ndash; sadly, many of them do not &ndash; and the wiring therein is substandard, the ESB cannot reconnect the power supply. The people in question will not be in a position to pay for the installation by electrical contractors of modern wiring systems in their houses. Accordingly, their power supply cannot be reconnected and they will not be able to return home.</P>
      <P>My next question to the Minister of State refers to the Red Cross fund. In terms of the management of that fund, is there a precedent to allow people who are not insured, who have substandard electrical wiring in their homes and who, consequently, cannot have the power supply reconnected to proceed to employ contractors to upgrade their wiring? Alternatively, will Dublin City Council &ndash; in most cases, the houses in question are former local authority dwellings &ndash; be in a position to employ contractors to upgrade the wiring and be reimbursed for doing so? If that is the case, I am informed by Dublin City Council officials that they will then be able, quickly and collectively, to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that, notwithstanding the speed of what occurred, the emergency services &ndash; our initial assessments uphold this &ndash; worked extremely hard and took quick action. What happened was most unexpected. The specific point raised by the Deputy is contemplated by what I stated earlier, particularly my comments on damage to homes being covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" />Deputy Quinn raised a particular question about electrical wiring in some of the houses in question. Dublin City Council has also identified this problem. We will work with the council in respect of this matter and action will have to be taken quickly because our efforts will be for nothing if people cannot return to their homes. Proper wiring will have to be installed, particularly in view of the dangers involved. We will be working with the council to ensure that this matter is dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the success of the Red Cross in matters of this nature has been its ability to deal with each individual householder and his or her needs in a fast and efficient manner. I was amazed that it dealt with the whole country albeit there were bulk areas in Wicklow, the last time. In eight weeks from the date of receipt of application all the money had been given out. It was a remarkably quick turnaround. Deputy Quinn in particular would understand that. I have absolute confidence in the Red Cross. We have been talking to members of the Red Cross over the weekend and yesterday. I confirm to the House that the formal meeting resulting from the Government decision will take place tomorrow morning. The Red Cross has prepared well in the past 24 hours to deal with this.</P>

      <P>I welcome the aid package. However, does the Minister of State accept that given the current trend of flooding, in particular related to global warming, there will be at some stage a recurrence of this flooding? Does he accept, therefore, that it is necessary to build adequate sea defences in this area? Does he realise, for instance, that Stella Gardens is below the level of the river and for that reason is susceptible, and that on the other side of Derrynane Gardens a wall has been built so that the water has only one way to go and that is into this very vulnerable area? Is he further aware that if people claim against their insurance for damage caused by flooding they will not be covered for such damage in the future and that, therefore, it is imperative that a proper wall or defence be built? Will the Minister of State give a commitment to the House that such a proper defence will be built as a matter of urgency?</P>
      <P>While we all congratulate the hard work of everyone involved in the clean-up on Friday and Saturday, does the Minister of State accept there were certain deficiencies in the emergency plan, which should be reviewed? There was a need for a co-ordinated effort and central control that did not materialise. People were going from one place to the next and were unsure what to do, and this gave rise to a certain amount of anger among people in the area. Will the Minister of State carry out a review of the emergency plan and return to this House with information about what went right and what deficiencies there were so that in future we will be better prepared for such an eventuality?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we cannot debate here what new defences might be put in place. It would be unrealistic and wrong to do so. Further, the Deputy will be aware that immediate remedial work must be carried out in certain areas. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, has visited the area, as have many of the Deputies in the House today, and he has briefed me at first hand on the extent of the difficulties, which must be rectified quickly. We are in consultation with the local authority to ensure it is done quickly and efficiently.</P>
      <P>The bigger question the Deputy raises is whether it is possible to identify the causes so that a scheme could be put in place that would prevent a recurrence. Because this was so sudden and happened in such an incredibly short space of time, we just do not know at this stage. That will be a long process. However, we are talking to the local authorities and will work with them to identify causes. For the information of the House, the figure relating to the tide was very startling. The highest tide ever recorded was in 1924 and was 5.10 metres. The tide on Friday last was 5.46 metres, a substantial increase on that in 1924.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister of State's reply, did officials from the Office of Public Works visit the East Wall and North Strand areas? I ask because the national media in general and RTE in particular do not appear to have been aware that communities in East Wall, North Strand, Abercorn Road, Shamrock Cottages, right along the north side were very badly affected with in excess of 200 houses destroyed by the floodwaters. I want to establish that the <Col N="1127" /> Minister of State and his officials are aware of that.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State that there was no shortage of effort and that the emergency services worked very hard on Saturday in the aftermath of the flood, as Deputy Quinn said. There was a co-ordinated response and great initiative was shown by the officials. However, I was at Shamrock Cottages at 2.00 p.m. on Friday, as was the Taoiseach, and the local authority seemed to be inadequately resourced to deal with the immediate effects of the flood. Even items such as sandbags were almost non-existent for several hours. There appeared to be no resources and certainly no plan to deal with the initial effects as people's houses were progressively flooded. I am not criticising the efforts of city council officials or the emergency services. The effort, the willingness and the initiative were there. Anything that was done was done on the immediate initiative of officials and not in response to any well laid out and co-ordinated plan. That is why I am asking the Minister of State to look into that and critically and carefully examine what resources are available so that proper steps can be taken to rectify matters should such an event occur again.</P>
      <P>The area between Spencer Dock was the special responsibility of the Office of Public Works for a long time. Will the Minister of State have the area between Spencer Dock and the Liffey, and Newcommen Bridge and North Strand surveyed immediately to see what measures can be put in place to make a recurrence of this flooding less likely? CIE demolished walls in that area. Shamrock Cottages would not have been flooded but for the fact that CIE had demolished a wall and left in place a ramshackle gate through which a river of floodwater flowed down a slope and wiped out a whole community. It was like a ghost town that evening. Every family, elderly people and single people, had to leave and go into emergency accommodation. That was the direct result of CIE's negligence. Some of the other breaches where walls collapsed and the East Wall area was flooded seemed to be not simply the result of the force of the flood waters but the result of gates being left open on a huge expanse of railway in that area that could have contained the waters. In addition, walls were in very poor condition and collapsed easily, contributing to the flooding of the area. Measures can be put in place, not to provide against further flooding but to make it less likely and to give people and emergency services time to respond. I ask that the Minister of State put in place measures to respond to those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister of State aware that even people who are insured and have money for temporary accommodation are finding it difficult to rent suitable accommodation? Will he ensure that whatever measures are necessary will be taken? If it is necessary for the local authority to lease apartment blocks to provide immediate, proper <Col N="1128" /> and adequate accommodation, will he ensure those measures are taken urgently?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a range of issues, all of which are important but not all of which necessarily come within my area of responsibility. On the first point he raised with regard to whether there was an Office of Public Works presence, I confirm that my director of engineering services was present at the particular location, as was the Taoiseach and others. To avoid confusion, we are not part of the emergency response team. I thank my officials who were very proactive and left their homes to go to work immediately, not just in Dublin, but throughout the country where flooding took place. That was very helpful in getting first-hand information back into the system. The Spencer Dock area is now the responsibility of Waterways Ireland with which we will be in contact. There are things which semi-State companies, private companies and local authorities can do on a regular basis, which would not take up much resources and would help enormously when it comes to sudden events such as occurred last weekend. I encourage them to do them.</P>
      <P>Deputies made a number of points with regard to the ability of emergency teams to respond in such situations. There is a full review taking place of how the emergency services came together in dealing with the problem. There is no system that is perfect and if there are flaws, they will be identified. When people find themselves in a sudden panic situation, as is implicit in what Deputies and the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, have said, perhaps it would be helpful if a mobile information unit could be quickly put in place in order that they have a central point to which they can go for imparting or receiving information. That is one of the lessons that has been learned from the weekend's events. I take the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan's point in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the unit would not be put in the middle of the flood. However, somewhere adjacent would be preferable in order that people would know there was a place to which they could go. I know that Deputy Quinn jests because it was such a serious and deep flood. Nevertheless, the point has validity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority of which Deputy Quinn is a member is making its own major assessment of how this has gone, and the resources it needs. It will make that assessment after which it will talk to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is responsible for that area and I am sure what needs to be done will be done. Considering the immediacy of the need, my Depart<Col N="1129" /> ment is on full alert and fully involved with the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the humanitarian aid fund. I am delighted it is being set up as it will be a source of great relief for many. What is the budget allocated to it and what will it cover? One had to see the devastation to believe it. People's homes have been wiped out with all their contents gone; people have lost their cars with baby-seats and other items. It has been very traumatic. One woman told me poignantly that the only item she had been able to save was a wedding album. People will want to know how they can access the fund and how the assessment will be done. Any information the Minister of State can give us will be helpful. Leaflet drops in affected areas worked well. How will the details of the fund be communicated to people living in Ringsend and Irishtown? I ask that this be done as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>On the broader issues, does the Minster of State believe that a river management plan is necessary for the Dublin area, and there is a need, as I believe there is, for ongoing monitoring of defences along the rivers in question? This has not been done adequately and we need such a plan to be put in place.</P>
      <P>In relation to emergency planning at local and national level, it is clear from what we saw at the weekend that there are certain deficiencies. One could not fault the individual efforts of members of the local authority, as colleagues have said. People have made enormous individual efforts, but it is clear there is a lack of co-ordination. It seems, although the local authorities, Garda and health boards are available, the central co-ordination of services remains an outstanding problem. This is reflected in the fact that it has taken a number of days to provide a central location where people can go to be informed as to exactly what is going on.</P>
      <P>We must realise that any emergency situation is very traumatic, emotions are high and people are confused. We should have a better co-ordinated centralised plan and get the best out of the emergency services which did very well in difficult circumstances. I understand there is no statutory underpinning for a centralised element as we saw during the flooding. I would like the Minister of State to comment on this. It is an issue for the future. It is Ringsend, Irishtown, Foynes and other parts of the country that are in the news today, but this is a key underlying issue in relation to how we cope with emergencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's last point, it was centralised at the Dublin Corporation offices. That is where the central headquarters was located and all the information decisions&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. However, we cannot have a number of centres. There are only so many people who make the key decisions. I <Col N="1130" /> cannot have them everywhere. From my experience of seeing flooding at first hand in Clonmel, what looks at first like a disjointed and unco-ordinated effort is not necessarily so. I had that feeling in Clonmel when flooding occurred very quickly and I was able to get there to see it for myself. However, when I spoke to those working with the various services involved, they knew precisely what they were doing, where the resources were and what was needed. I was not in Dublin last weekend, but the information that has come back to me from the Minister, Deputies and my officials is that there was co-ordination, although this may not have been apparent in some cases.</P>
      <P>The question of resources was raised by Deputies. It will be looked at in the review. With regard to the budget, I do not have a specific figure and do not know what the budget will be, but it will be in keeping with similar funding provided in the past. Once I receive the assessment of the Red Cross of needs I will issue funding. I do not receive information on individual cases. That is a matter between individuals and the Red Cross. I simply receive the global figure from the Red Cross and issue funding directly to it to be distributed on an individual basis. This has worked extremely well and removes politicians from the equation which, in a sense, is a good thing because people have great confidence in the honesty, integrity and neutrality of the Red Cross. I did not receive one complaint about the previous scheme, which is a great credit to the Red Cross. This will be done immediately.</P>
      <P>In the next few days the Red Cross will advertise in the newspapers; the areas most affected are covered by local radio which the Red Cross may also use. Forms, as previously, will be available from local Garda stations, community welfare offices, health agencies, local authorities and charitable organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Red Cross. There will be massive coverage. People will have quick and easy access to application forms in order that there can be a quick response.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether a major river management plan is needed for the River Liffey. In the overall sense, questions arise following the events of last weekend at which we will look in our discussions with the relevant local authorities. However, I caution the House that these are not quick assessments. It is not something that can be done in one week or one month. There is much detail that must be gone through before we come up with anything and this will take time. However, I am sure consideration will be given to these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to shift the focus from Dublin from where I saw the scenes dramatically relayed by television. Foynes did not feature on television but I have an interest in what happened there because one of the people affected was my mother, along with many others. It was not the first time that Foynes has been subject to flooding and the problem for some people is that they do <Col N="1131" /> not have indefinite cover from insurance companies if there is flooding &ndash; the premium shoots up or they withdraw cover.</P>
      <P>I saw what happened and the trauma it caused for people who had the contents of their houses ruined. I compliment the local fire service and local authorities for their response. Not only did they pump water from people's houses, they helped to remove sodden carpets and other items. The community responded by telling those affected to go elsewhere while they tidied the house.</P>
      <P>The problem remains afterwards, however. Anyone who has seen the effects of flooding on the inside of the house, who has experienced the smell as it dries, and the trauma it causes to those it affects, will welcome the quick reaction. While any assessment will take time to find out about insurance cover and the damage done, it will have to be carried out as quickly as possible. Many people will have to return to those houses. In such situations, something must be done to put down floor covering and to help settle affairs with the insurance companies. Prompt action is required.</P>
      <P>In Foynes the scale is less than that in Ringsend &ndash; there are 12 or 13 units affected &ndash; but this is not the first time the area has been flooded. An embankment at the back at the houses in Foynes was removed as a result of land reclamation even though it was a natural barrier. Now when the pier overflows, the water flows over the railway line, through the houses and into the main street. I ask the Minister of State as a priority to get the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with the local authority, to look at the situation. Shannon Foynes Port Company must also have a long-term responsibility to put measures in place to ensure this does not happen again.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State's attention is focused on the situation in Dublin but I seek reassurance about his intentions for Foynes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not forgotten about Foynes or other areas around the State. I am dealing with those Deputies who have raised questions this afternoon. We are in consultation with the local authority in Foynes and we will see if there are measures that can be taken to prevent a recurrence. This is not the first time this has happened in Foynes but I do not know if anything can be done immediately. We are talking to the local authority and if a scheme is put forward, we will examine it. At present I cannot say any more except that we are as concerned about Foynes as about anywhere else. This is not a Dublin issue, it is a national issue, although it was the first time this happened in such an unexpected manner in the capital city.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the excellent work of the Red Cross in the previous compensation package. In spite of some people's oppo<Col N="1132" /> sition at the time, it worked out well and I hope the same procedure is put in place again.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will remember that a year ago we were talking about flooding in Wicklow and Clonmel. This time an area of Arklow was flooded. Last year, funding was allocated for some areas in Wicklow &ndash; Avoca, Baltinglass and Aughrim. Work has been carried out in Aughrim but in Avoca and Baltinglass it has not because of a lack of liaison between the local authority and the fisheries board. Perhaps the Minister of State could mention this to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to see if anything can be done. A year after the last discussions, while money has been allocated, nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State met a deputation from the local authority and local flood action group in Arklow and funding was put aside for a consultant's report. Nothing has happened since. Can the Minister of State give an indication when the report will be finalised and will he indicate to me that he will implement its recommendations? Given that there has been another incident of flooding in the area, does he agree it is imperative that the consultant comes forward with a report as soon as possible, even on an interim basis, and that something is done? The people of the area believe they have been forgotten about. I do not know how long it took to build the Great Wall of China but it has taken a long time to solve the flooding problem in Arklow.</P>

      <P>There is problem upstream from Avoca, at the White Bridge, in relation to dredging. The area may not be included in the work currently under way to prevent flooding but a sand bank there must be removed and it should be done while the work is being carried out.</P>
      <P>There were wry smiles when there was flooding in Bray because a major coastal protection scheme costing millions of euro had been put in place, on the advice of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. It was not the most popular scheme in Bray on aesthetic grounds, but it was carried out by the Department for the town council. At the southern end of the sea front, however, even after the beach was provided, a number of houses were flooded. It is hard for people to understand how that happened after so much money had been spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now concerned that the southern end of the promenade could be undermined in a way that has not happened previously. I ask that proposals from the town council, particularly for the extension of a low wall, be included in any package &ndash; not as a long-term, final measure, but to <Col N="1133" /> protect householders and businesses who were affected by these unprecedented but not necessarily unique events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the coastal erosion scheme being run by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. If local authorities come to us with suggestions, we will look at them. We have already given the local authorities funds to carry out a number of schemes. They have spent some of the money but Deputy Timmins is right &ndash; they have funds that they have been unable to spend because they are trying to find agreement between local groups. That frustrates all of us and we urge them to find consensus.</P>
      <P>The UDC in Arklow has engaged consultants and we are paying for the report. We expect it within a month, a reasonably short time frame since it was commissioned, and we will make assessments and contact the local authority. It may appear that very little has happened but we are coming to the end of a detailed process of analysis.</P>

      <P>I draw the attention of the Minister of State to flooding that occurred in Ballylongford village last week. More than 15 families were affected, with some of them being forced to leave their houses. It has happened in the past, but not to the extent of last Friday. The local residents are very concerned that action is taken to ensure there is no recurrence.</P>
      <P>I visited the scene of the flooding and the extent of the damage is terrifying. A number of other locations in the country also suffered damage, but in County Kerry, Ballylongford was the worst affected. The village is low lying on the banks of the River Shannon. It has been threatened in the past with flooding, but on this occasion the situation was very serious. The local residents are deeply concerned.</P>
      <P>A number of businesses were affected, including a butcher's shop. I saw the cold rooms that were destroyed and a number of other premises, including public houses and a solicitor's office. Will the Minister of State ask his officials in the Office of Public Works to undertake a report on Ballylongford? I saw a number of sluices over which I am sure he has responsibility. They were not operating properly.</P>

With regard to the contractual bills for electricians involved in repairing or upgrading the electrical wiring in houses, most, but not all of which are former local authority dwellings where there was not and is not insurance, will the Minister of State clarify whether the money will come out of the general fund administered by the Red Cross or indicate to which Department should Dublin Corporation apply? Can the corporation proceed to contract the work in advance of payment? Can the Minister of State's word, in effect, stand as a commitment in principle to funding?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State referred to the Red Cross administering a fund in November 2000 and I am delighted to hear there were no complaints. There is a sensitive situation between those who were and were not insured. According to the information I have been given on a number of occasions those insured who claim will lose their cover. I see the Minister of State is shaking his head, but Deputy Quinn and I attended a meeting where an insurance expert advised me of this. I hope the Minister of State will clarify this aspect. Those who are not insured will, I hope, benefit from the Red Cross scheme, but they will then be able to insure their houses. This peculiar situation could lead to tension. I seek clarification on this point as it is one about which I am constantly asked.</P>
      <P>Cars are not covered for flood damage. Some use their cars for their businesses and they are in immediate need of a replacement. Will they be covered by this fund and what happened previously in this regard?</P>

I will not, therefore, be in a position to report back to the House, but the Deputy can raise the issue with him. It would be wrong to make generalisations from what the Deputy has said. While I cannot speak about specific cases, I have no sense or experience of a blanket change in approach.</P>
      <P>There is slight confusion in the House on the question of insurance cover and I do not want it to spread. I have put in place a humanitarian aid fund which will cover everybody. Individual circumstances differ, for example, it does not necessarily mean that those with insurance cover are automatically excluded. I am aware of an old age pension couple with a small level of insurance cover which will not restore their loss. I do not exclude anybody from the fund. Hardship suffered is taken into account, including, for example, those who have lost their businesses, such as the taxi driver referred to by Deputy Quinn. Those who consider themselves to be in need can apply to the fund, following which an individual confidential assessment will be made by an official from the Red Cross, on which basis funding will be provided.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State may not have direct responsibility for a number of the issues I have raised, but I am anxious he refers them to the relevant Minister and that within a reasonable timescale other Members and I will get answers to the issues we have raised. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate such a timescale. I appreciate that a number of elements, such as surveys, will take time to expedite, but many can be speedily addressed. I am concerned to hear the Minister of State say his officials will contact Waterways Ireland. I would have hoped contact has already been made and that the body is assessing the issues I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to understate the effort or initiative shown by officials in their response to the flooding, nor the hours they have put in to addressing the problems that have arisen. Some of them have worked without sleep. I am concerned at the emergency plan. The flood started shortly after 1 p.m. in the North Strand area. I would have thought in any emergency plan the media would have a role in guiding people and that the media would be made aware of the situation. At 4 p.m. that afternoon I listened to RTE News, the main point of which related to the difficulties of Deputy Liam Lawlor, while the homes of hundreds of people in the centre of the capital were under four or five feet of water. I rang RTE's news desk to let it know and it changed its priorities very quickly. If the emergency group was in operation in the Civic Offices, I would have thought it might have been in contact with RTE to inform it of the enormity of what was happening and to give some direction and guidance <Col N="1136" /> to people because they were at a loss. Will the Minister of State ensure the plan is reviewed urgently, carefully and critically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan is being reviewed urgently and critically. While I told the Deputy earlier that my officials would be in contact with various bodies I was simply responding in general to the point he has made. Any points raised today will be conveyed to those bodies. That is not to say we are not involved with those bodies already, of course we are. Waterways Ireland has been on Spencer Dock with its own people. If I gave the wrong impression, that was not my intention. Obviously those discussions and liaisons will continue. In the context of what happened, the Department would urge an objective critical review of the services. I am happy to confirm that is happening because there are, obviously, issues involved that need to be improved upon. I am pleased that all Members have acknowledged the individual effort made by so many people in Civil Defence, the fire brigade service, the Garda, the local authorities and my Department. However, the point being made is on the question of resources and how one conveys this and if it was as good as it should be. There appears to be some question mark in this area and it is legitimate to raise those points. There are issues which relate specifically to Dublin for which immediate remedial works will be required. I have no doubt about that and we are working with the local authorities to ensure that is done. There is also the wider and long-term picture.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the manner in which they have handled this issue. It is important when people are in distress that we are calm about what we are doing. In respect of giving and eliciting information, hope I have given the House information. I thank my officials for all their efforts over the weekend and, in particular, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Ryan, who kept me briefed by 'phone over the weekend and today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State that assessment should be based on individual need rather than differentiating between those who are insured and those who are not insured because a whole range of factors come into play. Will the Minister of State clarify if the humanitarian fund will cover house contents and cars, based on individual need? Will he liaise with the Department of Health and Children given that there are health concerns in the area about the water and the sewage that flows through? People are concerned about the implications of this, how they should handle it and what they should do when they go back into their homes. They have raised the matter at individual level but it needs a more structured response.</P>

      <P>On a previous occasion I asked the Minister to consider preparing a register of hot spots so that areas around the country which are given to flooding would appear on a local authority register and in the event of heavy rain or bad weather that they would be called upon as a priority. I have in mind places such as the river Poddle at Poddle Park and Ravensdale Close in Kimmage where there is a sluice gate. Once the water gets heavy the gate is blocked with litter. The water rises on to the road, a plateau on the road forms a dam and the problem gets worse. That area could be one to be included in a register. I ask the Minister of State to ask the local authorities to prepare a register of hot spots so that in the event of heavy rainfalls they can take preventative measures. At some stage, perhaps the Minister of State would inform me of what progress is made with the local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue, on which much work has been done in the past 12 months to two years. What the Deputy is pointing out is the flood risk mapping question. This is not alone an historical record but may predict into the future and it would be helpful to local authorities in regard to the whole issue of planning. Assembling the information is a complex task. We have had much discussion and assistance and information filtering in to us. We will probably take an area of the country and carry out a specific pilot scheme to see whether it measures up, because serious questions arise in regard to insurance potential, flood costs, local authorities etc. when something like this is done. I confirm that is a live issue in the office, it is being dealt with and we want to get it completed. It is a complex matter. We are in the middle of it. We will have a process but it is not a short-term matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As with other amending legislation in the housing code, this Bill ranges over a number of different areas. However, the principal driving force behind the Bill is the need to make statutory provision for a number of measures aimed at increasing social and affordable housing provision.</P>
      <P>The priority afforded by the Government to social and affordable housing provision was clearly articulated in our Programme for Government and refined and updated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and in other policy documents produced by the Government, most recently Action on Housing published in June 2000. This is the first Government to include targets for housing delivery in a national development plan. These ambitious targets include 41,000 local authority housing starts over the plan period and an increase in voluntary housing output from 579 in 1999 to 4,000 units per annum under the programme by 2006. In total, over the plan period, the housing needs of some 100,000 households will be met under the various social and affordable housing options.</P>
      <P>Unprecedented progress has been made in meeting housing needs since the Government took office. In each of the five years since 1997 to 2001, successive record levels of housing output has been achieved. In total some 216,000 new houses have been built in the past five years representing some 18% of our total housing stock. We have also built up the local authority and voluntary housing programmes &ndash; the voluntary housing programme to levels never previously reached and the local authority housing programme to levels we have not seen for a generation. Last year's forecast local authority housing output of 5,000 units represents the highest level for more than 15 years. By the end of last year the Government provided more than 18,000 local authority houses since taking office, with a further 4,000 units in voluntary housing projects. My Department has also provided funding for more than 5,500 units under the shared ownership scheme. In the period 1997 to the end of last year, the needs of almost 50,000 families will have been met through the various social and affordable housing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill adds to the wide range of legislative and policy instruments available to the Government in the housing area. In summary, it provides for a significant increase in the borrowing limit of the Housing Finance Agency to enable it to provide finance to local authorities for housing capi<Col N="1139" /> tal purposes and to extend the power of the agency to lend for additional purposes, including capital purposes under the Local Government Sanitary Services Act, the Waste Management Acts or other Acts prescribed by the Minister, and for lending directly to voluntary housing bodies.</P>
    <P>The Bill places the affordable housing scheme on a statutory basis and makes provision for a clawback under this scheme and the shared ownership scheme. It introduces greater flexibility in relation to the administration of the new house grant scheme and provides an up to date statutory framework for financial assistance to organisations providing advice or research on housing issues. Provision is also being made for a number of other amendments to housing legislation and technical amendments to the Building Societies Act 1989.</P>
    <P>I will now refer in some detail to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 6 provides a statutory basis for the affordable housing scheme, giving housing authorities and voluntary bodies clearly defined powers to build or arrange for the building of new houses for sale by them at an affordable price to eligible purchasers.</P>
    <P>Our intention to crank up the volume of housing output under the local authority affordable housing scheme was clearly signalled in the national development plan. This scheme enables local authorities to construct new houses which will be offered for sale to eligible purchasers at cost price and, accordingly, at a significant discount from the market value of comparable houses in the area. The necessary funding to facilitate an output of 1,000 units per annum under this scheme has been provided for in the national development plan. The indications are that last year a total of 300 units were completed under the scheme, with 6,270 units under construction or planned at the end of September 2001. At least 150 units have been completed so far this year. Provision of new housing under the scheme complements activity under the shared ownership scheme, which achieved some 1,200 completions last year, exceeding the target in the national development plan. The improvements in output have been complemented by improvements to the terms of both schemes introduced in Action on Housing. These improvements include the introduction of a site subsidy of up to £30,000 in urban areas for houses built for sale under each scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the payment by housing authorities of a mortgage subsidy to eligible persons who have received a loan from a housing authority, and that these subsidies may be recouped in part or all from moneys provided by the Oireachtas with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 8 requires each housing authority to establish a scheme which determines the order of priority to be given to persons to whom affordable houses are being made available for sale. <Col N="1140" /> The section also sets out the matters to which the housing authority shall have regard in the making of such a scheme. These include the accommodation needs and current housing circumstances of applicants, the period for which applicants have resided in the functional area of the housing authority and the distance of affordable housing from the applicant's place of employment. There is also provision for periodic review and amendment of the scheme of priorities by a housing authority.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 recognise there is also a need to provide housing authorities with some degree of control on the resale of houses supplied under the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes, so that undue profit cannot be made by those to whom a house has been made available under either scheme. These sections, therefore, provide for controls, including a clawback of profit, on the first resale of houses purchased under these schemes in the event that houses are sold by the initial owners within 20 years of the date of purchase.</P>
    <P>Section 10 specifically provides controls on purchase of the interest of the housing authority in a house within 20 years of the date of the shared ownership lease. The provisions in relation to the clawback on profit made on the first resale of a house under both schemes mirror closely the clawback provisions on affordable housing provided under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. In addition, sections 9 and 10 also provide that moneys accruing to a housing authority under these sections should be used by the authority in the provision of housing.</P>
    <P>The social housing programmes remain the primary vehicle for providing access to accommodation to lower income households. The Government has committed itself, under the NDP and Action on Housing, to a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme of 25,000 starts, beginning last year and running through to the end of 2003. Consequently, local authorities are now building houses at a rate not seen for many years, to such an extent that, under the programme, there were about 7,000 starts in 2001 and 5,000 completions. As I indicated, this is the highest level of starts since the mid-1980s. The multi-annual approach, introduced to allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the increased local authority housing targets, is showing dividends.</P>
    <P>To maintain this momentum under the various social housing programmes and give effect to the commitments in Action on Housing, section 17 provides that the borrowing limits of the Housing Finance Agency be increased from the existing limit of £1.5 billion to &euro;6 billion. The present statutory limit of £1.5 billion has been in place since 1992 and will be reached by the agency by the middle of this year. The massively increased housing programme contained in the national development plan makes it both urgent and essential that the Housing Finance Agency's borrowing limit be increased. This increase to &euro;6 <Col N="1141" /> billion will cover the agency for about eight years at predicted future levels of activity.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the expanded role envisaged for the voluntary housing sector under the national development plan, section 17 also provides that approved voluntary housing associations may be afforded direct access to funding from the Housing Finance Agency, subject to terms and conditions which must be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, including appropriate conditions to minimise exposure of the agency to risk resulting from such lending. Under the current arrangements voluntary housing associations only have indirect access to funding from the agency through the local authorities under the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes and the sale of sites subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also provides that the powers of the Housing Finance Agency be extended to enable it to lend to local authorities for certain non-housing related capital expenditure purposes. These include funding to allow local authorities finance the up front capital cost of the commercial and industrial elements of new water treatment and delivery networks and waste water collection and treatment systems. These costs will be fully recovered over time along with relevant operational costs from commercial and industrial customers.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing sector, as I indicated, is playing an increasingly important role in the provision of social housing. The indications are that output by the sector last year was around 1,200 units, which is broadly in line with the NDP target and the highest level of output ever produced by the sector. There has also been a marked increase in the number of units of accommodation under construction and at various stages in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>It is clear the sector must be supported financially to continue to grow. Last year we provided more than &euro;1.1 million in grant aid to voluntary housing bodies specifically to assist with their administrative costs and in carrying out research. I am anxious to clarify the position in relation to the provision of financial assistance to approved housing bodies as current legislation is unsatisfactory in this respect. Section 12 brings together the existing provisions governing financial assistance to approved housing bodies by way of grant aid. This section provides powers to the Minister to pay grants to bodies providing research or advice on housing or promoting the provision of housing by voluntary or co-operative bodies. I have also taken the opportunity to clarify the aspects of housing research that may be grant aided. They include research on housing needs, standards, management, finance or other aspects of housing policy.</P>
    <P>Section 14 clarifies the management functions of housing authorities in certain cases. It amends section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966, to provide that in cases where housing authorities purchase apartments in private developments and rent them to tenants, they may pass on the service or management charges to the tenants. It also pro<Col N="1142" /> vides that the maintenance of common areas is not the responsibility of the housing authority. These charges do not arise in most dwellings owned by local authorities and where they do arise, they should be able to pass them on to the tenant in whole or in part at their discretion. This is to ensure that local authorities are not held responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of common areas where management companies charge owners of all dwellings sharing those areas for such services. It is the management company not the local authority which should be responsible for this task.</P>
    <P>Section 14 also confirms that housing authorities can perform management functions, including the charging of rents, in relation to dwellings procured through arrangements such as a leasing arrangement between a local authority and owners of private accommodation whereby accommodation is made available for tenants designated by the local authority. This amendment is necessary because section 58 of the 1966 Act empowers them to charge rents only in the case of accommodation owned by the authority while local authorities will in future need to provide dwellings in a variety of ways, including leasing, which do not require the local authority to own the dwelling. The extent to which local authorities will be responsible for the management of such dwellings will be provided for in agreements with property owners. This is an important provision as local authorities increasingly use a wider range of ways for providing housing, including the purchase of apartments in private developments under arrangements provided for in Part V of the Planning and Development Act and otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 15 clarifies the liabilities of housing authorities following the sale of a dwelling under a tenant purchase scheme in terms of the provision of services and insurance of that dwelling. Following such a sale, it is the tenant and not the housing authority who is liable for any service or work charges in relation to common areas. Once the dwelling has been purchased it is privately owned and the owner becomes liable for all costs arising in up-keep and insurance.</P>
    <P>Because of the additional functions being introduced for housing authorities under Part 2 of this Bill in relation to affordable and shared ownership housing, it is necessary to amend section 23 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, which provides for the definition of a housing authority and the housing functions of different categories of local authorities. The effect of the amendment provided for in section 16 is that county councils and city councils will have the full range of housing functions, including functions under this Bill. Borough councils and town councils will have the same functions as at present except that the borough councils of Drogheda, Sligo and Wexford and the town councils of Dundalk and Athlone are being given functions under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a number of measures in the private housing market. Our <Col N="1143" /> commitment to addressing the imbalance in the private housing market was signalled early in the life of the Government with the publication of Action on House Prices in 1998. The measures contained in that policy document and other measures introduced subsequent to that have had the desired effect in terms of increasing housing output and moderating house prices. Last year housing output was more than 51,000 units, the fifth consecutive year of record housing output by this Government. House price increases have also come back to annual rates of around 5% to 6%, rates which are very closely aligned with movements in consumer prices.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of Government policies has been to afford greater access to the housing market to first time buyers who are now accounting for an increasingly large share of the market. Section 11 updates the general power of the Minister to pay new house grants. This updated provision will enable us to remove a small number of anomalies, in particular to ensure that following a legal separation applicants who are themselves first time purchasers will be eligible for a grant. Heretofore a grant could only be made available in these circumstances when the applicant could prove hardship.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to provide flexibility for the payment of grants in the future, including provision for differential rates of new house grants to encourage, for example, more efficient use of energy, including the use of renewable forms of energy in line with the national climate change strategy.</P>
    <P>The availability of accurate and comprehensive information on all aspects of the housing market, in particular trends in relation to house prices, is essential for the development of housing policy and policy instruments. My Department currently obtains and publishes average house prices on a quarterly basis for new and second hand houses in Dublin, in the other major cities and nationally. Given the importance of comprehensive house price data, my Department engaged the services of consultants to examine the house price information currently obtained by my Department and data otherwise available and to assess and recommend how to improve the use and analysis of the data. This work is now completed and the consultants have recommended that the existing data be augmented and improved information technology systems developed with the aim of providing a broader range of house price indices for statistical purposes. Provisions are included in the Bill to facilitate this.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that anonymised data provided to the Department by mortgage lenders will be given appropriate protections and cannot be disclosed to any other person, except in accordance with arrangements made between the Minister and the mortgage lenders concerned or in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>Mutual building societies play a key role in the operation of the private housing market by con<Col N="1144" /> tributing to competition and diversity in the mortgage market. It is estimated that they account for about one quarter of the mortgage market. It is important that mutual building societies are able to compete with other financial institutions on a level playing field. The main body of legislation governing the operation of building societies is the Building Societies Act 1989. The environment in which building societies operate has changed significantly since 1989, most particularly in recent years with much greater competition in the mortgage lending market. Consequently, section 18 contains a number of largely technical amendments to the 1989 Act, including amendments intended to take account of changing accounting practices in relation to the preparation of annual accounts.</P>
    <P>Consideration is being given to the inclusion of a number of additional provisions in the Bill on Committee Stage in the areas of Traveller encampments, consumer protection and possible further amendments to the Building Societies Act 1989.</P>
    <P>The issue of encroachment on public and private lands by Travellers has been an issue of much genuine concern recently, particularly in those areas where large scale encampments were involved. Such unauthorised encampments raise issues wider than accommodation matters proper to the Housing Acts, such as issues of public order, intimidation and trespass. I have taken this issue up with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with a view to exploring whether this type of incident may require to be dealt with on a broader front.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has requested the committee which has responsibility for monitoring and co-ordinating the implementation of the recommendations of the 1995 task force on the Traveller community to consider the issue of trespass by Traveller dealers and traders. That committee has in turn set up a subgroup consisting of representatives of the social partners and Traveller organisations and officials of my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the issue. I also understand that the group is being assisted by representatives of the Garda and of local authorities in their task.</P>
    <P>Its terms of reference are to produce, by a consensus approach, a report on the issue of trespass by Traveller encampments and what can be done to minimise the negative impact of large scale movements of Traveller groups. My Department has also requested that the contents of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2001, which is a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill proposing to provide for new powers in this area, and introduced in Dáil Éireann on 14 November last, be examined in the context of the committee's consideration of the issue. The report of the committee should be completed within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>If the Government decides in the light of the committee's report that amending legislation is <Col N="1145" /> necessary, I anticipate that it would be done either by way of a Committee Stage amendment of this Bill or in a Bill to be sponsored by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Consideration is also being given to the need for certain consumer protection measures for new house purchasers. These include measures aimed at addressing gazumping in relation to the purchase of new houses, and measures aimed at protecting house purchasers from demands for excessive stage payments. I am concerned in considering these complex issues that there is no undue or disproportionate interference with the operation of the housing market and the long established contractual procedures for house purchase while at the same time ensuring that individual house purchasers are adequately protected.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses a wide range of issues but the urgency of some of its provisions mean that it is not as comprehensive as I would have liked. I have indicated a number of areas where further measures may be introduced on Committee Stage. The Bill, nonetheless, provides additional legislative support to the efforts being made by the Government, local authorities, voluntary housing associations and other actors in the housing area in the delivery of much needed housing. I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for producing this Bill. I listened to what he had to say with interest, particularly the issues which are not in the Bill but which may appear on Committee Stage. Gazumping is one of the issues that I intended to raise. I am pleased the Minister of State is examining that area and that some provision may be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome also his remarks on the intention to examine the issue of large-scale, unauthorised encampments. I am not sure I agree with the Minister of State that this is more properly a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Most of the problems in respect of Travellers that have come to our notice increasingly in recent times have arisen from inadequacies in the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, which was brought forward by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Minister of State will remember that I raised these issues at the time because I foresaw the difficulties that could arise with the open-ended provisions of that legislation, but I welcome the fact that it is being considered by the committee and I look forward to whatever suggestions the Minister of State puts forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad also that my Bill is being considered, although I said at the time that I was not in any way protective of that Bill. I want a solution and if the Government can come up with either the <Col N="1146" /> same or different ways of tackling the problem, I welcome that.</P>
    <P>On first reading the Bill I thought it was fairly innocuous and did not contain anything of great substance, although it gives a statutory basis to many of the measures with which we have now all become familiar in the housing area, particularly in the area of affordable housing. On my second reading, however, I discovered a major infrastructural policy change to which the Minister of State hardly referred or, if he did, he did not refer to the intent of the provision. I am talking about the provision of additional borrowing powers for the Housing Finance Agency to fund capital infrastructure previously grant-aided by central Government to the local authorities but which now, apparently, is to be borrowed by local authorities, the cost of which borrowing is to be passed on to the consumer. That is a fairly new departure by any standards and in view of the massive increase in investment required in waste management and water and drainage infrastructure, quite apart from the housing, which I welcome, represents an enormous increase in charges on the consumer, particularly those in rapidly developing counties with growing populations. Members of the public have had experience of operational charges, but incorporating the capital cost into the charges is a totally new departure.</P>
    <P>This issue will become particularly onerous in the area of the provision of water. If local authorities are to borrow over, say, a 20 year period for a water scheme and pass the cost on to the user, by law the only user they can pass it on to is the commercial sector. Is this the kind of provision that the Minister makes by stealth in a Bill and not by way of a significant announcement? This provision will increase the cost of business considerably and, ultimately, that increase will be passed on to the consumer. At a time of growing inflation these issues will be viewed seriously by the business community, particularly against a background where local authorities are increasingly dependent on commercial charges, be they water or other charges.</P>
    <P>I am not philosophically opposed to the concept of charges, nor is Fine Gael. It is clear that, for whatever reason, there has been much squandering of our Exchequer surpluses in recent years as money was thrown at every problem. Those surpluses are now gone and any future Government will have to find alternative and innovative methods of financing vital infrastructure which no one would deny we need. That cannot be done, however, by subterfuge or shunting some provision into a housing Bill in the hope that nobody will notice but which will be visited upon us in the future. The explanatory memorandum does not mention the intent of this provision, yet it is the most significant departure in the entire Bill.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Nice treaty referendum is an indication of how cynical the public has become about local, national and European politics. They do not see anything coming down the tracks because nobody is ever honest with them. <Col N="1147" /> If we are not open and honest with members of the public they will fight everything, including toll charges, etc., and it behoves us as politicians to be honest when we are making major changes like this one.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the Bill which I welcome. I particularly welcome the provision opening up eligibility for the new house grant to separated couples, which did not affect many people but represents an equitable change. I also welcome the possibility of incentives to encourage better energy use in housing, which is urgently needed. Energy saving in house building is still far below what it should be, and it is often better in local authority houses than in the private sector, but this may be a vehicle that could be used in the future to encourage the provision of better energy protection in houses.</P>
    <P>What strikes me about the Bill, welcome as many of the provisions are, is that it has failed to tackle most of the critical issues surrounding the current housing crisis. I accept that the housing crisis is cyclical and that it is a different crisis every other year, but the vital national issue to be addressed now is the tragedy that an increasing proportion of the population has no possibility of providing for their own accommodation needs, whether that be by home ownership or renting. Much of the blame for that lies with the Government. I listened to all of the boasting from the Government about increased output in 2001, but I would point out that the private output was down. I welcome the fact that, overall, output is up but that is as a result of planning decisions made at least five years prior to that. It is the decisions being made now and the current environment, which has existed over the lifetime of this Government, which will impact on us in the future in terms of housing supply.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office the Government introduced a whole rake of policy changes but, within a number of months in some cases, it reversed them. Every one of those policy changes was entirely inappropriate and produced the reverse effect to that intended. Stamp duty is only one of them, although that is not a particularly useful incentive, or disincentive, in terms of manipulating buyer or seller behaviour, but to change it five times in as many years is a nonsense. It does not inspire confidence in the industry in terms of the buyer or the seller, and it is not an environment that can ensure continuity of supply, which is vital.</P>
    <P>For most people the option is to place themselves and their families on a council list. That was meant to be the vehicle for the provision of housing to people on lower incomes. It is now becoming the only vehicle available to the majority of the young population and, as the Minister of State said, the majority of the house-buying population are first-time buyers, given our demographic spread.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise enough that the only option for many people is not a housing one, but simply <Col N="1148" /> to go to the town hall to put themselves on the housing list. Most applicants do not have a realistic opportunity of receiving a council house, which is a source of misery and stress for many young people. Huge family and social costs are associated with three or four families being raised in the same house. It can be damaging to mental and physical health and can lead to homelessness or young people dropping out of education. Huge social destabilisation will result if we do not tackle this major problem.</P>
    <P>Homelessness, which is an increasing phenomenon, is one of the most visible results of the housing crisis. While I accept that it is not always caused by difficulties in finding accommodation, the homeless suffer most during a housing shortage. There is no doubt that homelessness can be attributed in part to the fact that people whose parents and grandparents bought houses cannot afford to buy them. The effect of this change ratchets right down through the market, so that those who ultimately suffer most are those at the bottom of the pile, such as the homeless, the elderly, single people and those living in rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's attempts to address the housing shortage involved the removal of interest relief on mortgages on properties for rental accommodation. There are two sides to the argument, but I believe fundamentally that it was the wrong thing to do. While I understand that the Government was trying to reduce prices, its primary objective should have been to increase supply. Investors were pushing up prices because of the housing shortage and if they did not ultimately pass on higher house prices, builders would have done it anyway. The reality is that investors can only avail of mortgage interest relief if they rent out their properties, but the initial objective was to provide accommodation. It does not matter if it is owned or rented, as long as decent accommodation is provided.</P>
    <P>The reason I mentioned the Government decision was to point out that it highlights official attitudes to renting. Implicit in the treatment of tenants by society is the belief that they are not as worthy as home buyers. If tenants are not the most popular people in the world, I assure the House that landlords are seen as on a par with, if not worse than, child abusers. This is reinforced by public policy and the fact that the tax system entirely discriminates against tenants and in favour of home buyers. We need a thriving rental market. Many more people would be far happier to rent if we had a proper rental environment. Those who rent are not only those who cannot afford to buy, as many people choose to rent. A solid rental market is economically critical, as mobility of labour is essential. Many workers have to move to another town as part of their employment and it is important that they are able to find rented accommodation. The role of the State in this regard is not to make it difficult for people to find somewhere to live, but to encourage the availability of rented accommodation. We <Col N="1149" /> should be able to choose between purchasing and renting as equally viable long-term options.</P>
    <P>When restoring interest relief, the Government made a big mistake by not introducing the promised residential tenancies Bill, which is critical if we are to achieve the desired effect of increasing the supply of rented accommodation. A much more professional basis is needed in this area, perhaps by introducing institutions who will be in for the long haul and who will provide the option of long-term renting. A larger scale of provision is also needed. I do not mean to be pro-tenant or pro-landlord, but legal protection of rights and clarification of responsibilities are essential. We will not have a thriving rental market until legislation is introduced. I recently read that landlords own one and a half houses each, on average, so we are not talking about the type of landlord of old, for the most part. I am sure there are bad landlords, as there are bad tenants, but the reality is that most landlords are ordinary, decent people trying to make a living. They are as vulnerable as tenants in many ways and both groups need to be protected. Somebody recently said to me that in the European rental market, which is vastly different to the Irish market, to have a long-term sitting tenant is regarded as an asset when selling and increases the price of the property. The situation in Ireland is precisely the opposite, as a long-term tenant is seen as a liability, but we can aspire to emulating the European model.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, we have to facilitate renting for a variety of purposes. Those living in bed and breakfast accommodation are just as homeless as those sleeping on the streets. People who are dependent on supplementary welfare are almost as badly off as the homeless, as they do not have quality of life as tenants, security of tenure, choice or mobility. Worst of all, they have no way out, as they will lose benefits if they take up employment. It is a poverty trap which needs to be overcome. We have spent a great deal of time talking about removing property tax from the tax system and I am pleased that many such taxes have been removed, but we have to find a solution for this important social issue.</P>
    <P>Many anomalies have arisen as a result of various Government interventions in the market, but they all go back to fact that there is a shortage of housing, which in turn stems from a lack of zoned, serviced land. The &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; nature of land supply leads to uncertainty. The promised national spatial strategy gave me hope that this crisis would be eased, but the strategy has been kept a secret for some reason. It is urgently needed if we are to plan the use of land in the long-term and if there is to be continuity of supply. Development plans would be informed by the strategy, which consequently would inform local authority plans for servicing when demand is sufficiently high.</P>
    <P>We need to address the manner in which land is serviced, zoned and brought on to the market, to guarantee supply and to take housing out of the realm of speculation. When we talk about <Col N="1150" /> speculation, we think of developers and the Flood tribunal, but we all tend to think of a house as a capital asset, rather than as a form of accommodation. Houses are seen as capital assets instead of social assets. The Irish psyche has its speculative side, perhaps as a result of our history. It is not easy to change such an attitude, especially as it is fed by a shortage of zoned, serviced land and uncertainty regarding the value of lands and the value of existing houses. The fact that developers hold land for up to 20 years, even if it is not zoned, pushes up the cost of land. One can be sure that the cost will eventually be carried by the consumer. We need to take the cyclical frenzy out of the housing market because it results in panic interventions which are usually counterproductive. We must try to get back to an orderly supply of land which will accommodate an orderly supply of housing to meet demand. Another advantage of a longer planning and zoning horizon would be certainty as people would know in advance where developments would take place. It might reduce the level of planning objections which hold up supply.</P>
    <P>I find the 20% provision in section 6 intellectually attractive as it involves a legitimate windfall gain tax. Another advantage of the proposal is that it encourages social integration. However, I have serious reservations about the proposal and I do not think it will work. These reservations may involve the manner in which the proposal is being implemented, but the matter must be examined carefully. Some local authorities are flexible and some are rigid, but this proposal is slowing down the planning system. Negotiations in some local authorities continue endlessly &ndash; first in the housing department, then in the planning department and so on. This is consuming precious time in planning and housing departments.</P>
    <P>The resistance to the 20% provision which manifests itself in the slowdown in supply does not come from builders, who feel they can live with it provided they have certainty. The resistance comes from buyers and that is the reason for the slowdown in the housing market. If buyers will not buy, builders will not build. I do not know how to solve this problem as the proposal has an intellectual appeal which makes it hard to do away with as an idea. The 20% social housing provision is attractive, but 20% of nothing is nothing. Builders are mobile and can go and build in London or Barcelona, but this will not solve our housing crisis. To the extent that it is interfering with the supply of housing, we have to be careful with this provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is reluctant to resort to off-site provisions, land swaps and so on, but he mentioned circumstances in which it is necessary to allow for this option. I am referring to situations involving a single apartment block. I cannot see the provision working in such instances because of the 80% element. People will not buy in those circumstances so we will not achieve social integration and the local authority will end up buying the entire apartment block. This pro<Col N="1151" /> posal has an appeal, but I do not think it will work and must be kept under careful review.</P>
    <P>On the provision regarding the two year withering of permission which was inserted to prevent a flood of applications prior to the introduction of the 20% provision, this did not happen to any great extent and some local authorities operated a voluntary provision of 10% or 15%, even outside the period in which the provision became mandatory. If this provision is implemented across the board it will have a detrimental effect on supply for the next five years. Many of the applicants who will be affected have not even obtained permission as applications have only been lodged. In some cases it could be another three years before they have been through An Bord Pleanála and so on and another two years before the measure takes effect. This provision will reduce supply and must be examined by the Minister of State. He does not have to throw the baby out with the bath water, but builders who have permission and who have demonstrated a genuine attempt to deliver their houses should be exempted from this provision. I have less sympathy for those who lodged applications the week before the provision became mandatory.</P>
    <P>The element of the provision involving the external wall stage does not relate to the manner in which building sites operate. For example, an enormous town centre is being built in my area, but, even with the best will in the world, there is no way in which it could be constructed within two years. Those involved will have to go back to the planning process for the housing element of the project and there is nothing to be gained from this. This process is costly, it is clogging up the planning system, causing delays for everyone and reopening the process to appeal, thus holding up the rest of the development. The real reason for dealing with this provision is that it will slow down supply at a critical time.</P>
    <P>On the problem of affordability, in his speech the Minister of State outlined that the thrust of Government policy is to make housing affordable. This approach has been successful in some counties, but not in others. This problem involves the shortage and cost of land, but the parameters of the scheme are missing the target in urban areas. The income limit in some cases is too low to allow those who need to participate in the scheme to do so, while those who fall within the limit are not sufficiently well-off to do so as they cannot afford the repayments. The income limit eligibility has to be increased significantly if people are to be able to afford a house in urban areas, particularly in Dublin. The subsidy for this scheme must also be increased. This will involve a cost, but I do not wish to contemplate the social implications of not providing a real alternative and opening up shared ownership to many more people. Getting on a housing list is not an option and is not desirable as the main solution to the housing issue.</P>
    <P>I raise the issue of controlled rents which will <Col N="1152" /> take effect in July, but which is not dealt with in this Bill. This provision will result in successor tenants losing the protection of controlled rents in July. The Minister of State said that about 600 families or individuals will be affected by this provision. I suspect the number is larger as the Minister of State depended on people who registered with or answered letters from local authorities. For months I have been asking the Minister of State to outline how he attempts to deal with this problem. People who have enjoyed low, controlled rents cannot be exposed to the full rigours of the market literally overnight. In fairness to those involved, the Minister of State should make an early decision and let people know how these matters will be dealt with. July is not too far off and many matters may intervene, not least an election. Many of the tenants involved are elderly and it is only fair to them that the Government announces how it intends to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I have raised the difficulties in An Bord Pleanála with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. These problems are holding up supply. The Minister of State insists that these problems have been solved, but that is not the case. I do not know whether the problem is at board, administrative or planning level, but I ask him to examine this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The public learned on 18 June 2001 that the major British insurance group Independent Insurance Company Limited had been put into liquidation some days earlier. The company had stopped writing new business in agreement with, or at the direction of, the insurance regulator in the UK, the Financial Services Authority. The <i>Financial Times</i> at the time estimated that some 10,000 Irish policyholders were affected. Since that date last year virtually every Member of this House has been in receipt of correspondence and representations concerning the implications of the Independent Insurance col<Col N="1154" /> lapse. The impact on business, especially small business, and thus on employment was the most serious consequence.</P>
      <P>That was before 11 September. The full impact of 11 September is still unknown. However, it has caused arguably the most serious shock ever to the insurance industry. The combined effect of the collapse of Independent Insurance and 11 September has produced an environment of uncertainty and escalating insurance costs. These two factors have again brought focus on our domestic insurance environment and on whether there is real competition in the market place, whether exorbitant legal and professional costs can be sustained and whether legislative reforms are necessary. At least, these issues have been the focus of discussion everywhere, it seems, except in Government. This is difficult to understand in the context of pleas from individual SMEs that escalating insurance costs may threaten their viability and lead to further job losses. Business lobby groups have been highlighting this issue as being at the top of their agenda for Government action since last summer, but there has been no Government action.</P>
      <P>The one initiative that the Tánaiste or Minister is likely to promise again tonight in replying to this debate is the personal injuries assessment board. The purpose of this initiative is to reduce the legal and other costs associated with the delivery of personal injury compensation, but this is an initiative of the Rainbow Government. In May 1997, following acceptance of the McAuley report which was established for the purpose just described, a pilot project was ready for implementation. This Government has never explained why such a personal injuries tribunal, as it was then called, never went ahead, nor why it is now being revived and considered a good idea. It seems this Government abandoned the idea on coming into office. On 13 June 2001 the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, told the House: &ldquo;The decision of this Government to establish a personal injuries assessment board by next year seeks to address the issue of the high cost of settling claims by achieving a reduction in the delivery cost of personal injury compensation for work-related injuries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years, Deputies have been besieged by irate young people who cannot obtain reasonably priced motor insurance cover. Last year, for example, the National Youth Council of Ireland produced a report, The Plunder Years, highlighting the plight of young people who in many cases are expected to pay more for insurance cover than for the vehicle being covered. More recently, motorists generally are contesting unprecedented hikes in their insurance premiums. The insurance industry is promising more of the same. What has the Government done about these issues? Apparently, it has set up the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, or MIAB, to advise the Minister. Over the same period of around three years it has also promised to <Col N="1155" /> introduce a penalty points system for road offences. However, this has not yet been implemented.</P>
    <P>The public would not know about the tentative conclusions of the MIAB if an <i>Irish Times</i> journalist had not extricated an interim report under the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The findings of that report seemed to contradict the traditional arguments of the insurance industry, not least as they related to young drivers. The Minister of State apparently received the interim report in July 2001. Although he was questioned on several occasions in the House on the issue of young drivers, the Minister made no reference to the interim report on his desk or its shocking findings. When its findings became public the Minister lined up with the industry and derided his own board's advisory report as incomplete. The board itself seemed to indicate that the industry was being obstructive and its chairperson thought that it might become necessary to recommend an alternative and more rigorous forum for investigation in this area of public concern. The Minister kept this a well-guarded secret, but after the Freedom of Information revelation he told the House to await the complete report which, he said, would be produced before the end of 2001. For example, on 3 May 2001 he told Deputy Flanagan that he was &ldquo;confident we will produce a good report before the end of the year,&rdquo; and by 20 November he had evolved a new formulation when he told me that he expected to receive the final report &ldquo;by the end of this year.&rdquo;  It is now 5 February, almost four years after he set up the advisory board, and there is still no final report.</P>
    <P>All of this betrays procrastination, inaction and neglect on the part of Government on one of the most pressing issues of the day &ndash; access to reasonably-priced insurance cover to permit normal business to continue and the provision of affordable insurance cover for young drivers. The Labour Party motion is designed to allow the House an opportunity to debate these major issues and to oblige the Government to acknowledge that its hands-off policy is threatening serious damage to our employment prospects.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a letter which I sent, in desperation, on 29 March 2001 to the Mr. Niall Crowley, the chief executive officer of the Equality Authority, on the question of young drivers because nothing was forthcoming from the Government. As we say in our motion, the Labour Party believes that the Equality Authority has the power to conduct a statutory inquiry into allegations of discriminatory practices based on age or gender, using its power to require the production of documents and attendance of witnesses. The letter stated:</P>
    <P>As I understand the situation, as well as the Equality Authority having a general remit to police this legislation and to work towards the elimination of prohibited conduct, it may for that purpose conduct a formal inquiry.</P>
    <P>It has powers to insist on the supply of neces<Col N="1156" /> sary information, the production of documents and the attendance of witnesses to give evidence under oath. Failure or refusal to comply with the orders of the Authority is a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>I make this point in the context of the Minister repeating his mantra today that he cannot get information. He said he cannot do anything because he cannot get information, but I am putting forward a way, using a statute law, to extract the information.</P>
    <P>The letter continued:</P>
    <P>I also understand that such an inquiry may relate not just to a specific and individual complaint but to sectoral or industry-wide practices. Indeed, it is hard to see how such practices could effectively be investigated and eliminated except by adopting such an approach. As well as making findings and recommendations your Authority is empowered to issue legally binding 'non-discrimination notices' requiring that specific practices should cease and that specific steps be taken to ensure that discrimination does not recur.</P>
    <P>The letter is a great deal longer in its submission to the authority, but the chief executive, Mr. Niall Crowley, came back to me to say it was indeed within the remit of the authority and it would be delighted to undertake it, but only if the Minister made the budget available. I sought that on a number of occasions, but to date nothing has happened. The Minister's plea is that it is with the MIAB. Today he came into the House at Question Time and said he could not get the information, so he could not make any decisions. There was a way of getting the information that only required some funding. It would be eminently reasonable in the context of the scale of the problem but the Minister has not done it.</P>
    <P>A major issue arises as to why an insurer writing cross-border business in a single insurance market can evade its responsibilities to policyholders in other states of the EU. In the case of Independent Insurance, it was selling insurance cover on the Irish market for many years, initially on a direct basis and latterly through an Irish branch. The real losers following the collapse were corporate policyholders and claimants on them, such as employees with outstanding injury claims etc. As a UK authorised insurer, consumers who were personal policyholders were eligible for compensation, perhaps up to 90%, from the British Policyholders Protection Board. The Minister has made clear that the UK authorities will not compensate Irish commercial policyholders. This means that a great many small companies lost their insurance cover and were obliged to go back into the marketplace to get insurance.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House has examples of how expensive that has turned out to be. I know a company that had paid £220,000 for employer's liability and having lost it was obliged to pay £510,000 to be re-insured. One significant <Col N="1157" /> employer in an Irish context wrote to my colleague Deputy Howlin to say that his company:</P>
    <P>is facing exceptional loses of in the region of &euro;900,000 in the payment of additional premium and to cover claims already in the pipeline. On top of this we are also facing increases of 100% for premiums into the future. . .  We expect to suffer extra costs of in excess of &euro;2 million over the next few years as a direct result of the collapse of Independent Insurance.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that it will undoubtedly lead to job losses.</P>
    <P>A well known family-run hotel employing 250 staff wrote to me to say:</P>
    <P>We hope you can understand the shock we suffered. . .  We are now in a position where claimants are suing our business. Solicitors who previously acted on behalf of Independent Insurance are seeking funds from us. . .  We estimate that our business is exposed to £500,000 in claims and we have no insurance cover in respect of them. The enforcement of these claims against us may force us to sell part of our property as we are already heavily indebted to the bank.</P>
    <P>A small company with an estimated turnover of £140,000 sent me the reply from its broker:</P>
    <P>I am now in receipt of quotations back from the market and it is with great regret that I have to report that the best quotations we have secured are as detailed in the attached summary.</P>
    <P>The summary shows the 1999 premium was £2,300, the 2000 premium was £3,537 and the 2001 premium was £11,450.</P>
    <P>A small manufacturer employing 35 people wrote to my colleague Deputy Shortall saying:</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months we have experienced a 100% rise in our insurance costs. . .  Indeed for a time at the latter end of last year we had a grave concern that we would not be able to obtain insurance at any cost.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that his company has the ISO 9002 quality system for ten years and makes the following remark:</P>
    <P>Over the recent past the consolidation by the insurance industry is resulting in a reduced number of insurers which I feel is extremely serious as this effectively reduces the level of competition in the industry and increases the risk of a cartel like situation.</P>
    <P>I could continue with examples for more time than I am allotted. I am sure my colleagues on all sides of the House will be giving further examples from their own constituency experience. Insuring against the risk of injuries to employees or customers seems to have attracted the steepest increase in premia. Small builders, steel erection companies, hauliers, restaurants and high risk <Col N="1158" /> manufacturing are subject to ever greater price increases than the average.</P>
    <P>After 11 September we have seen the Government, like other member governments of the EU, bonding the aviation industry for billions. If Governments had refused to intervene the airlines simply would not get insurance cover in the marketplace. Apparently this inability to get insurance cover against terrorism risk for property and certain kinds of business has now become general. Many commentators interpret this trend as the insurance industry seeking to transfer huge exposure from the private sector to member governments. The explanation is that when insurance premiums come up for renewal the industry cannot get re-insurers to underwrite the risk. Coverage in Ireland in this area is not compulsory and there must be a prospect of some commercial properties not being insured against terrorist attack.</P>
    <P>Insurance premia for employers, public liability and for motorists have risen dramatically over the past year or so. The insurance industry pleads 11 September, the collapse of Independent Insurance and High Court decisions that require insurers to strengthen reserves against pending claims. This trajectory of dramatic increases in costs is forecast to continue. The Small Firms Association argues that insurance costs have increased on average by 41% in 2001 and thousands of small businesses now face the prospect of greater average increases that will probably be 50% in 2002. The cumulative impact will cost jobs and some small companies will ultimately find it difficult to trade. The rate of accidents in Ireland is high, the propensity for litigation ubiquitous, the legal costs exorbitant and the awards higher than in most other jurisdictions. However, the SFA argues that despite analysis demonstrating that the accident rate has fallen, costs associated with accidents have risen. It says that total premiums paid by Irish business is over £1 billion annually and that the total insurance market is £2.8 billion, of which £600 million goes to pay the legal and administrative costs associated with claims.</P>
    <P>In April 1997, as Minister with responsibility for commerce, I took the report of the special working group on personal injury compensation that I had established under the chairmanship of Dan McAuley. It recommended the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal, which I authorised initially on a pilot basis, which was designed to substantially reduce the number of personal injury claims being brought to court, thus reducing the legal and other costs involved in the delivering of personal injury compensation. The costs of delivery of compensation, it is argued &ndash; although contested by the Bar Library &ndash; run at 40% of the total cost of claims. That was in May 1997 and discussion on the manner of its implementation was to proceed as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to discern whether the new Minister stopped its implementation or simply allowed <Col N="1159" /> the McAuley innovation to die. The record shows that it was only after an outcry from the Opposition parties that the McAuley group was revived in September 1998. We do not know why the McAuley group became redundant in June 1997. We do not know what went on between June 1997 and September 1998, but we do know that the personal injuries tribunal was never established on a pilot or any other basis. Curiously there is no date on the second report from the McAuley group, but its non-appearance featured strongly at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on 9 January 2001. Eventually on 27 March the clerk of the Joint Committee was advised:</P>
    <P>Following a Government decision last week we now have the green light to proceed with the main recommendation of the group which is the establishment of a Personal Injuries Board, PIAB. An interdepartmental implementation group will be set up shortly to decide on how best to establish such a board.</P>
    <P>Almost four years after this Government came to office, Mr. McAuley's group produced a second report whose main recommendation was, unsurprisingly, the same as its main recommendation four years earlier in April 1997 in its first report, except, as is <i>de rigueur</i> in circumstances where Government is striving to conceal incompetence and neglect, a new name was attached to the main recommendation, namely, the personal injuries assessment board. On 27 March 2001, we were told that an interdepartmental group would decide how to implement the board. That was precisely the position in June 1997 and, in so far as I can see, that is still the position.</P>
    <P>This must raise questions about the political will in the Government to implement such a challenge to the existing order or, indeed, to implement any reforms in an area so important to the lives of so many people. Time and again over those four and a half wasted years the House has listened at Question Time and during Adjournment Debates to the mantra of the Minister which, in the interests of accuracy, I quote: &ldquo;The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual companies and the EU prevents us from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite.&rdquo; This mantra has been used as a shelter for the Minister to do nothing and, confronted now with a crisis, that mantra must be exposed as bogus. It did not stop the Minister for Public Enterprise from falling into line with other members states after 11 September to ensure that airlines could get off the ground. The pity is that she did not argue a wider remit. Nor should it stop any Minister from intervening at Commission level if necessary to ensure that small business is not grounded because of inability to secure reasonable insurance cover.</P>
    <P>In the context of this shelter for inactivity it is <Col N="1160" /> interesting to note the description by the chairperson of the MIAB, Ms Dorothea Dowling, of the board's remit. She said: &ldquo;The brief of the Board includes establishing whether the resultant costs are effectively and equitably distributed over various categories of drivers.&rdquo; I am bound to inquire what is the purpose of Ms Dowling and the MIAB in so establishing since the Minister's and his Department's mantra could not be reconciled with this purpose? Of course, the Government cannot continue to refuse to intervene in the circumstances now prevailing. The Government seems unwilling to confront some of the powerful vested interests in this situation. Therefore, there are no signs of these different interests playing their part in addressing a phenomenon now out of control. The result is that the consumer will pay, the taxpayer will pay and, worst of all, some workers will pay with their jobs. A number of the social partners, including IBEC and the farmers' organisations, and not just the SFA, have publicly expressed their alarm at the trend I have spelled out. Last week on the RTE radio programme, &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, Mr. Gerry O'Callaghan of the Joint Managers Body highlighted that the average cost of schools' insurance had risen by between 20% and 25% in the past year.</P>
    <P>There certainly is no EU veto to an Irish Government addressing the domestic costs environment. The Government is about to leave office and its one initiative, still not implemented, was inherited from the previous Government. I agree with the SFA that it is not possible to acquiesce in circumstances where it is claimed that non-compensation costs amount to over 42% in personal injury cases. I have great difficulty personally with the proposition that legislation to cap awards ought to be introduced. It seems that in the new worsening environment, given the political will, there are many things that could be done to end the charade that drags on in cases for so much longer than is necessary at enormous expense ultimately to the consumer.</P>
    <P>A huge proportion of the caseload where liability is not contested could be taken out of the courts and dealt with more speedily, more efficiently and less expensively in an alternative disputes mechanism such as was envisaged by the first McAuley report in April 1997 and in the second McAuley report in March 2001. I draw attention to section 46 of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, which allows the Minister for Justice to impose scales of costs in relation to particular cases. This permits, in effect, a sort of price control and it allows the prescription of &ldquo;appropriate scales of solicitors' costs and counsel fees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Without interfering with the citizen's right to access the courts or with the desirability of the court to use its discretion in a particular case, much can be done to bring reality to a process that is simply no longer sustainable. The fact remains that the man and woman in the street cannot understand the inordinate delay in settlement of cases. What are the obstacles in the way of early settlement? Would such delays be toler<Col N="1161" /> ated in any other walk of life? To what extent is the operation of the courts responsible? To what extent does the insurance industry deliberately contrive such long delays to get the benefit of investment income? Why does it take a year on average merely to deliver a defence? Why is there a continuing lack of transparency in the figures published by the insurance industry?</P>
    <P>The story on the motor insurance side is no better. The Government is aware of the hugely punitive situation that applies to young drivers in particular. Latterly, the problem of escalating premium costs has begun to apply to motorists generally. Yet the pace of any tentative steps by Government is so slow that there is despair, especially among young drivers. How can the typical young person be expected to source from &euro;4,000 to &euro;6,000 or higher for insurance cover? Some young drivers are paying over ten times the average car insurance. For example, a 17 year old driver from my constituency is paying £3,800 to insure a 1100cc Ford Fiesta for third party fire and theft. A 22 year old driver on a full driving licence was paying £2,230 to cover a 1300cc Mazda. He had a crash and was required to pay £4,300 to renew his policy. A father and his 23 year old son on a provisional licence on a joint policy to insure a Mitsubishi Lancer are paying £98 per week or £5,096 per annum. A 20 year old driver from Tallaght on a provisional licence was quoted £6,000 to insure a new Ford Focus.</P>
    <P>I accept that young Irish male drivers have a disproportionately bad record in terms of safety. However, there are thousands of responsible young drivers who need a car to earn a living and who are denied reasonably priced insurance. This is very unfair to young people who are responsible drivers. I accept that the insurance companies cannot predetermine who will be the responsible drivers, as compared to who will be the reckless ones. However, serious hardship is being imposed on young drivers whose parents are not in a position to bail them out. The insurance industry has not explained why its traditional explanation for the loading on young drivers has been challenged by the interim report from the MIAB. For example, that interim report states:</P>
    <P>The most significant indication to date is that young policyholders, who pay the highest rates, produce larger surpluses of premium over claims cost than most of those aged 25 and over. This is based on the average of five years data received for the years 1993 to 1997. The classification of all drivers under 25 as a non-profitable risk for insurers is now open to question. For example, the margin of premium over claims cost was £211 for ages 22 to 24, compared to £60 for ages 46 to 55, or a 258% higher margin. On average for the five years 1993 to 1997, every age of policyholder contributed more in premium than claims cost, except for the small number of policyholders aged 17 and 18. One of the highest profit margins was 30% for policyholders aged 66 to 70.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> That report goes on to state that although the authors had been furnished with gender data only to 1997, &ldquo;Women also appear to be contributing more than their fair share in certain instances.&rdquo;  The board further notes that &ldquo;the majority considers to be unduly simplistic suggestions that issues relating to the cost of insurance will be resolved by reduced accident frequency.&rdquo;  If this conclusion is reinforced in the much awaited final report, it will stand the conventional explanations on their head.</P>
    <P>The interim report concludes:</P>
    <P>All board members are anxious to reach decisive conclusions. This is dependent upon receipt of the data required for further analysis of premium charges and claims costs over various categories of risk. If the IIF does not provide the raw data, the majority of the board believes that it may become necessary to recommend an alternate and more rigorous forum for investigation in this area of public concern.</P>
    <P>In deference to my colleagues, I must defer the remainder of my contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate and I regret it is not possible to deal with all the issues in the limited time available. Like my colleagues, I have been contacted by many small businesses which are facing great difficulties. I will quote one company which contacted me today, knowing the debate was to take place. It is a small company, employing 52 people, involved in the tourism and leisure industry and its employment doubles during the summer period. It faced an increase last year of 33% and its broker has advised it that there is a prospect of a 50% increase this year. In recent years businesses, particularly those in my constituency of Kerry South, try to invest any profits they make. The tourism industry in the area has prospered as a result because the facilities on offer have been continually upgraded. However, if insurance costs continue to rise, there will be no money available to reinvest. This will lead to a loss of jobs in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main issues to which I wish to refer is the high cost of motor insurance, which has been tolerated by the Government and used as a tool to keep young drivers off our roads. I appreciate that the highest percentage of road accidents and fatalities involve people in the 17 to 25 year age group. Sadly, people in my constituency and others throughout the country have experience in this regard. I argue, however, that there are numerous means by which young people who speed or drink and drive can be encouraged to desist from doing so. I accept that hitting them with high insurance premiums can prove to be a disincentive, but it is not acceptable or fair that other young people are being penalised for misdemeanours on the part of some of their peers. The latter is particularly true in the case of young people in rural areas who do not <Col N="1163" /> have access to public transport. As the Minister of State is aware, these young people rely on their cars to get to work, travel home to care for their elderly parents and engage in social activities.</P>
    <P>Many young people from remote parts of south Kerry have informed me that they cannot take up job offers because they cannot afford to pay the insurance on their cars. In addition, they are not in a position to qualify for cover on their parents' insurance as many did in the past. That is no longer an option. Another factor that mitigates against young drivers is the lack of competition in the motor industry. I spoke to a 19 year old man last week who could only find one company which would offer to insure him on his car, but even then the huge cost was far beyond his means. If there was a greater degree of competition in the market, this young man, who needs to insure his car for the purpose of gaining employment, would have enjoyed more success in obtaining insurance.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to take on board another issue. I refer to the crisis in the insurance sector &ndash; a matter I raised in the House last year &ndash; namely, in terms of insuring events and festivals. Puck Fair, fleadh cheoils and the St. Patrick's Day parades are being financially crippled as a result of the huge insurance costs being imposed. This has resulted in many events being scaled down or, in some cases, cancelled. These festivals are part of our tourism culture and should not have to be cancelled as a result of such huge costs.</P>
    <P>There are other issues with which I would like to deal, but do not have the time to do so. However, I wish to refer to one final issue on which Deputy Rabbitte also touched, namely, insurance costs for schools, particularly national schools. I thought the days when parents were obliged to knock on doors to seek funding to pay for facilities in national schools were long gone. However, it appears that they will return if insurance costs rise any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely broad canvas upon which to paint in five minutes and I will not attempt to deal with the many facets to the motion in respect of which our spokesperson, Deputy Rabbitte, argued so ably. The Deputy was the previous Minister of State with responsibility in this area, but, unfortunately, his tenure was too short. If he had remained in office, many of the issues being addressed in this debate would have been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many, the issue of insurance costs is a yawn. I am intrigued by the huge crowds in attendance in the Visitors Gallery and the Press Gallery tonight to listen to this debate. Members, however, receive a great deal of correspondence about this matter from people expressing their concerns. Real problems are being posed across the economy due to the difficulty in obtaining affordable insurance for certain categories of people and businesses. That is an undeniable fact. <Col N="1164" /> Having listened to the contribution of the Minister of State at Question Time I am less than expectant that we will receive a comprehensive response.</P>
    <P>This is a multifaceted motion and I would like to spend time which I am not in a position to do discussing the fact that many young people find it impossible to start driving. It is not as if we have a public transport system, particularly in rural areas, which gives people options. The Government operates under the pretence that it is serious about the development of infrastructure in rural areas and about holding together communities situated in areas outside the main conurbations. The issue of affordable driving of which insurance is a critical component has been neglected for the past five years by the current Administration.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the critical difficulty in the maintenance of employment and of small to medium-sized businesses for the want of affordable insurance. I want to deal with the pressure being exerted on businesses of various sizes as a result of the collapse of the Independent Insurance Group and the consequent pressure placed on companies seeking affordable insurance. Illustration is the best form of debate and I wish to refer to three companies in my constituency in Wexford &ndash; the experience of which, I am sure, is mirrored in businesses throughout the country. My file is full of correspondence about matters of this nature from businesses in County Wexford alone.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the first company as &ldquo;Hotel A&rdquo; because I do not want to identify it. This hotel was developed at a cost of £3.5 million over the past five years and has been left with no insurance and vulnerable after the collapse of the company by which it was insured. The business is vulnerable to claims of tens of thousands of pounds and those who run it regard their position as critical. There is no affordable replacement for the hotel's insurance and it is at a loss, not only for the cost of the premium, but also for the considerably greater cost of finding a replacement insurer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte has already referred to &ldquo;Hotel B&rdquo;, which has a staff of 135 and which, so far, has been exposed to £75,000 in claims. The owners of the hotel fell vulnerable because their business has already been affected by the impact in the reduction in tourist numbers in recent months. According to the most recent statistics, the south east has been the most seriously affected area in this regard. In order to obtain replacement insurance for that which it has lost, the company involved has had to defer plans for much needed expansion and place further investment on hold. These are not flights of fancy, but concrete examples.</P>
    <P>The last example to which I wish to refer is a large family business which employs 500 people. The company in question also lost its premium last year and found, after much difficulty, an expensive alternative. Those who run the com<Col N="1165" /> pany estimate that this will result in an additional cost of &euro;2 million in the coming two years. This will have implications for any planned expansion and proposals to create new jobs.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight a further example, which is even sadder than those to which I have already referred. I refer to a group of workers who were laid off from one of the many companies in County Wexford which closed down in recent years. These workers wanted to establish their own business and had the necessary skills and business plan to do so. However, they could not do so on foot of a lack of affordable insurance.</P>
    <P>These are real issues that are affecting employment, sustainable business interests and young people, to mention but three categories. I commend my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, for tabling this motion. However, we expect something more than platitudes from the Minister if he has any recognition of the scale of the crisis that is real in our community.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;fully recognises that the major determinant of the price of insurance in Ireland, is the high cost of settling claims;</P>
      <P>Having regard to the existence of the tort system for deciding levels of compensation; the proportion of the cost of claims accounted for by legal costs; the cyclical nature of the insurance market; the implications of the collapse of Independent Insurance Company Ltd. (UK) on 17 June, 2001; the serious implications of the events of 11 September last, in the United States of America, for the global insurance industry, particularly the increased cost of re-insurance; and the fact that there have been no failures of insurance companies here in Ireland since 1984;</P>

    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes that this Government considers that further reductions in fatalities and accidents, are achievable;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the Government's proposed reforms in the Road Traffic Bill that are designed to further reduce road traffic accidents, and the initiatives planned by the Health and Safety Authority and the Workplace Safety Group to effect further reductions in accidents in the workplace; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the Government on all of its efforts to date, to ensure adequate, sustainable and reasonable cover for all insurance consumers.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the difficulties being experienced by all consumers of insurance, both personal and commercial, in the past two years. I am also aware that prices have increased sharply in the past year, and especially since 11 September last.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons, both international and domestic, for these increases. First, insurance, both global and domestic, is a cyclical business, and it has been generally agreed that after a number of years of technical losses the insurance industry, both in Ireland and elsewhere, was entering a phase of the cycle, where prices would increase, even before the unfortunate events of 11 September last.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the current losses as a result of the 11 September attacks in the USA are in excess of $115 billion. This has seriously impacted on the global insurance industry. Most of the insurance losses will be borne by the same re-insurers with which Irish insurance companies would hope to reinsure their future large losses. The two main companies affected as a result of the situation in the United States are two of the leading players in our insurance market.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that the international reinsurance market's capacity to cover losses has been impaired. As a result, certain types of cover &ndash; for <Col N="1167" /> instance cover for losses resulting from terrorist actions &ndash; may not be available again or may be available only at a very high price. Normal reinsurance cover has increased greatly in price, reflecting the changed circumstances. Until the capital available to the international industry is again commensurate with the value of potential losses, reinsurance will remain relatively expensive.</P>
    <P>The net effect for consumers is that the cost of insurance cover has increased dramatically and the availability of cover has contracted accordingly. The Irish Insurance Federation acknowledges that the events in New York impact more severely on the cost of liability insurance than on that of motor insurance. Nevertheless, motor insurance will be affected also in so far as it is necessary to reinsure large risks, which are all too common in Ireland with our high claims costs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the effects of the insurance cycle and the events in the USA, there are domestic factors to be taken into account. Two High Court judgments on how to calculate future losses and on reimbursement of hospital costs by insurers have the potential to greatly increase awards in personal injury cases and highlight the need to strengthen reserves in outstanding cases. In addition, in relation to house insurance, there has been a succession of bad winters, giving rise to a significant number of property damage claims, in four successive years.</P>
    <P>Normally, insurers could expect that losses that are incurred in one year would be balanced by fewer losses in the following year. Unfortunately, this has not happened in Ireland for some time. Insurers in the past could rely on investment gains to help to balance losses. However, in recent years investments have performed poorly, thus adding to the need to increase premiums in order to maintain solvency margins and statutory requirements. Insurers would have their funds assets invested in a range of assets, for example, property, land, secured debts, cash etc. They would do this partly because of regulatory requirements but also as a matter of prudence to spread the risk to avoid the full consequences of a fall-off in return from a particular sector of the investment area, for instance, the area of shares, which can be particularly risky.</P>
    <P>Even within share investments they would be expected to have a balanced portfolio of share holdings e.g. IT, financial, general etc. Again, the reason would be to avoid too great an exposure to one area and to achieve a balance between risk and the potential for growth in share values.</P>
    <P>The difficulty, however, is that stock markets in general have performed less well in recent years than heretofore. As we know, the IT sector has had a particularly noticeable downturn, due to a slowdown in the general world economy and consequently in demand for its products.</P>
    <P>The decrease in investment returns is having a considerable effect on insurers' investment income. Unlike previously, when good invest<Col N="1168" /> ment returns could be used to offset losses in underwriting, this is no longer the case.</P>
    <P>The Irish stock market has fallen considerably in recent days, but share values can vary considerably over time and so a long-term view is required. However, at present, investment returns internationally are currently low across the board.</P>
    <P>Many consumers are exasperated because they are asked for higher premiums although they have not made a claim. While I can understand their annoyance, it is worth bearing in mind that insurance always seeks to pool risks. Thus, when the number of claims is significant, the burden of paying is borne by all policyholders although those who make claims may be asked to pay rather more than the generality of policyholders. With the alarming scale of the increases in the cost of insurance in the past year and those suggested as being likely in the coming year, many look to the Government to intervene.</P>
    <P>The cost of insurance in Ireland is not a new problem. Governments have grappled with this problem for many years. With the creation of the European Union Single Market in insurance, we looked forward to more competition on the market from EU insurers. To encourage such competition, the cap on commissions was removed by me. However, the numbers of EU insurers seeking actively to write insurance on the Irish market still remains disappointing. As the Single Market matures, we may see greater interest in writing insurance in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>As the legal completion of the Single Market for financial services, including insurance, was achieved, the sector was the subject of a round of mergers and take-overs. It is argued that such mergers will bring benefits to consumers arising from economies of scale. Many consumers are sceptical of this and believe the contraction in the number of companies offering insurance, is linked to increasing prices. As I have already pointed out, there are other factors, such as the point of the insurance cycle that we have reached. However, we continue to monitor this issue and will keep it under review, particularly in light of the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>The EU dimension brought with it certain disciplines. The Third Directives contain an explicit prohibition on price control or intervention by all governments. The logical consequence of the prohibition on price control is that it precludes Governments from intervening in matters of underwriting &ndash; for instance, in seeking to enforce a more universal approach to rating risks, or regulating how particular categories of risks may be underwritten. Thus, the Government cannot intervene in the current circumstances, to control prices or premiums. To do so would be contrary to EU Law.</P>
    <P>Taking account of this, the policy of successive Governments has been based on three principles: first, to encourage as much competition in the market as possible, if necessary by removing or <Col N="1169" /> minimising those barriers to entry that are within the control of Government; second, to recognise that the price of insurance is driven by the high cost of claims settlement; and third, to address claims settlement costs by reducing the incidence and severity of accidents and by seeking to reduce the cost of the delivery of personal injury compensation, now running at as much as 40% of the cost of claims.</P>
    <P>The Government's campaign to reduce road traffic accidents has been largely based on the national road safety strategy. The evidence is that this strategy is now working and is delivering reductions in the numbers of accidents, fatalities and serious injuries. These reductions are particularly impressive against the background of the greatly increased number of registered vehicles currently on the roads. According to the National Roads Authority, the number killed on Irish roads has declined from 478 people in 1990 to 415 people in 2000. Meanwhile, the registered vehicle population has grown from just over one million in 1990 to 1.68 million in 2000. This means that the fatality rate per million vehicles has fallen from 454 people in 1990 to 246 people in 2,000. The downward trend in the number of serious injury accidents continued, from 1,345 people in 1998 to 1,189 people in 2,000.</P>
    <P>This confirms that the Government's strategy is working. However, the Government acknowledges that there are still far too many accidents, too many seriously injured people and, regretfully, too many fatalities. Apart from the cost of insurance claims, the human cost of these accidents is unacceptable. We are determined to achieve significant further reductions. The Road Traffic Bill will introduce reforms that will strengthen, streamline and improve the enforcement of existing road traffic law. The picture is the same in relation to workplace accidents. Statistics supplied by the Health and Safety Authority and confirmed by an IBEC survey, published in March 2001, show that accidents in the workplace fell by as much as 21% from 1999 to 2001, according to the IBEC survey, although the numbers at work have greatly increased.</P>
    <P>The statistics support the Government strategy which has been to strengthen the HSA so that it may adopt the most effective strategies and to discourage the conditions which make workplace accidents possible. Further initiatives are planned to bring a partnership approach to making workplaces safer, including those associated with small and medium-sized businesses. In the circumstances, it is legitimate to question the reason that falling rates of motor and workplace accidents, taken together with greatly increased premium income due to the increased number of registered vehicles and the increased numbers of those at work, have not led to a fall in premium costs.</P>
    <P>The response of the insurance industry is that while the number of claims may have declined, the cost of settling claims has constantly increased. While the number of people sustaining injury of varying degrees of severity increased, it <Col N="1170" /> appears that the number of serious injuries has been on a downward trend. This suggests that the frequency with which insurers have to pay compensation is decreasing. However, it does not mean that the total cost of paying claims is decreasing accordingly. The insurance industry argues that costs are increasing to reflect our improved economy. Thus, for example, compensation for lost wages is now higher than it was three years ago.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the current policy initiatives being pursued by the Government, I would like to address the issue of Independent Insurance Company. Independent Insurance Company Limited was a UK authorised insurer. It is at present in provisional liquidation and the liquidation process must be dealt with under UK law. The company is under investigation by the serious fraud office in the UK also. The UK company collapsed on 17 June, a bank holiday in Ireland. My Department was notified on 18 June of this situation. We received several calls on 19 June from several important companies in this country which had lost immediate cover. On 20 June, I called in the IIF and had serious discussions with it which lasted for most of the day. I was able to ensure that alternative cover could be provided for companies which had not been insured in this country by any of the Irish operating companies for at least seven years.</P>

      <P>On 21 June, I met several of the affected parties about this situation and advised them as to what I thought they should do. The Government has been able to ensure that private policyholders in Ireland will be entitled to protection under the UK financial services compensation scheme. While this covers only 90% of any claim made against a policyholder, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland will cover the 10% shortfall in respect of third party motor claims. Unfortunately, commercial policyholders in Ireland are not eligible for cover under the UK scheme. They will be eligible as creditors for whatever percentage of claims the liquidator can eventually pay from the company's assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met representative groups and some of the commercial policyholders of IICL. I am awaiting full details of the exposure of Irish business as a result of the collapse of IICL. When I receive that information, I will consider the situa<Col N="1171" /> tion further. However, I do not wish to mislead the House or companies and individuals who find themselves in an unfortunate position. We do not consider that it is appropriate to ask the taxpayer to fund an intervention in this matter.</P>
    <P>The IICL collapse illustrates the need for companies, which, unlike private consumers, normally can expect to have access to in-house sophisticated financial expertise and advice, to be careful where they place insurance. The very competitive rates being offered by IICL on the Irish market were welcome. However, perhaps the subsequent collapse of the company goes some way to explain how such competitive rates could be offered in the first place to unsuspecting clients for over seven years. Some clients paid three years premia in advance.</P>
    <P>The gap in the EU's legislative framework in relation to the position of policyholders in the event of the failure of an insurer writing cross-Border business had been brought to the attention of the EU insurance committee by Irish officials long before the failure of IICL highlighted that gap. Discussions have begun with a view to EU agreement on an appropriate compensation mechanism. However, this is unlikely to be of practical assistance in the present case.</P>
    <P>The Irish supervisory authorities continue to pursue a policy of not tolerating insurance company failures. The supervisory regime is kept under constant review to ensure that it is sufficiently robust and searching to support the no-failures policy. The reforms instituted in 2001, after an IMF survey of our regime, will play their part in assisting us to maintain our record of no failures since 1984.</P>
    <P>I appointed the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in September of 1998, with a broad membership that is representative of the various groups interested in motor insurance, including representatives of consumers, insurance brokers, commercial motorists, young drivers, the Garda, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, driver trainers, accident victims, the motor industry and, of course, the insurance industry. This excellent board is chaired by Ms Dorothea Dowling, claims manager of CIE, and one of the board members is a professional statistician.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to take any abuse or blame to which I am entitled and I have no difficulty with that. However, I take issue with Deputy Rabbitte on two points. Prior to 1993, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board consisted of representatives of the IIF, the IBA, a statistician from the CSO, an official from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who acted as secretary, and a representative from the Automobile Association. The board produced annual reports on the basis of data from the IIF. The last report produced by it prior to my reforms was in 1993. Deputy Rabbitte was in office for three years and <Col N="1172" /> he had no meeting with the MIAB. He did not take action on its report and there is no point in him blaming me for the initiative that I have taken or for the fact that it has not concluded its work. The Deputy had the report although I do not know whether he looked at it &ndash; that is his business. There was no meeting of the board during Deputy Rabbitte's entire term of office. That is the <i>de facto</i> position.</P>
    <P>The board is in the course of finalising its report to me on motor insurance issues generally and on the relationship between the premiums charged to each category of driver and the claims experience for that category. I expect to receive the report next month. When it is presented to me, I will give urgent consideration to the board's recommendations and make appropriate proposals to Government. I am aware that there is a high degree of public interest in this report. Therefore, I will be publishing it as soon as the Government has had an opportunity to review it in detail.</P>
    <P>It is premature to speculate as to the impact which the report and its recommendations may have on the cost of insurance for young drivers. EU law prevents us from intervening in matters of either the pricing or underwriting of insurance. However, I am confident that the report will provide some transparency as to the relationship between risk and premium charges in Ireland. As I have said, the single market has not resulted in significant new underwriting capacity on the Irish market. One of the reasons for this may be that EU insurers may believe that the Irish market is too difficult and unprofitable.</P>
    <P>Given the greater transparency provided by the MIAB report and given that the insurance cycle is in an upward phase, the Single Market may facilitate developments in the insurance market akin to the Bank of Scotland's intervention in the mortgage market. Research into the difference between the high price of insurance in Ireland and the much lower price of insurance in other EU member states linked the high cost of insurance to the high cost of settling personal injury claims in this country. The cost of delivery of compensation, almost entirely made up of legal costs, now runs at approximately 40% of the value of claims. In cases of amounts up to &euro;15,000, the cost of delivery may equal the amount of compensation.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is to reduce the delivery costs in personal injury cases by reducing the number of cases that enter the legal system to achieve settlement. Since the insurance industry estimates that it pays out &euro;800 million per year in legal fees alone, the savings that would be achieved by a PIAB could be considerable.</P>
    <P>In March 2001 this Government approved the establishment of a PIAB and the setting up of an interdepartmental implementation group to progress its establishment. The group has made good progress in its examination of operational issues and the possible legal implications surrounding <Col N="1173" /> the establishment of the PIAB. I expect to receive the group's report in the next month or so.</P>
    <P>Again I have to take issue with Deputy Rabbitte who, in December 1996 when he was Minister of State, set up the special working group on a personal injuries tribunal. Its first report was published in April 1997 and consisted of a majority and a minority report. It was decided that the group should take up the second part of its mandate, to examine alternative systems of delivering personal injury compensation. Deputy Rabbitte led the House to believe that he created the group, got the report, put a structure in position and had it ready to roll. These are not facts. The McCauley group took up the second part of the terms of reference, which were agreed at the request of Deputy Rabbitte when he was Minister of State, to recover from the embarrassment caused by the minority report. These are the facts concerning what I inherited and they stand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte had the opportunity of dealing with it. He had a minority and a majority report. There was a division on the board which he was unable to handle. He passed on the soft ball and gave them the second option.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have to bring in a civil servant to give notes to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's problem is that he did not respect civil servants. He brought in outsiders and they gave him the notes. I remind Members that this Government has devised a policy for tackling high insurance costs that is realistic and does not look to quick fix responses which are not solutions in the longer run.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rates charged to young drivers, the MIAB will establish the facts of the relationship between claims costs for these drivers and the premium rates being charged. I fully understand the difficulties experienced by many young people and the need for many of them, especially in rural areas, to have access to competitively priced insurance so that they can travel to work. For this reason, I welcome the fact that some companies have introduced special initiatives designed to offer insurance to young people who are prepared to accept certain constraints or conditions at favourable rates. I have worked assiduously on some of these projects over several years. Market research and other sources concluded that they were not viable commercial alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I acknowledge that these schemes are fairly restricted at present I hope that they will prove so successful that they will become more common throughout the country in the years ahead. We have made good progress in reducing the incidence of accidents, both on the roads and <Col N="1174" /> in the workplace. We have in place the means to continue to achieve reductions in these areas and we will expect to see these declining accident levels reflected in future insurance premium charges.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the MIAB report will make a major contribution not only by informing the debate but also by providing information about the cost of risk which may encourage new players into our market. The PIAB will make a substantial contribution to reducing the cost of claims by reducing the need for legal involvement in the settling of personal injury claims. Since the cost of legal involvement may well account for &euro;800 million of the total cost of claims settlement at present the savings that may be achieved by the PIAB are considerable. Accordingly, I recommend the Government's amendment to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Belton, Naughten and Hogan. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this very serious issue and compliment the Labour Party on putting down the motion.</P>
      <P>Over the last number of years the whole issue of insurance costs in this country has been highlighted by many people. The cost of insurance has become astronomical since the collapse of the Independent Insurance Group and the tragedy of 11 September. As a public representative many people have contacted me regarding the cost of insurance. It affects almost every family.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister of State and it seems incredible that after four and a half years this problem is getting worse. These are the facts. Four and a half years ago insurance costs were a problem to young drivers, but they have increased dramatically during that time, as they have for business people. Unfortunately, nothing has been done about this.</P>
      <P>Affordable insurance is no longer an option for many people. Many young people who wish to have a car are prohibited from doing so by the cost of insurance. A car is not a luxury but a necessity for many young people living in rural areas. The Minister of State knows this. I can give an example from last year. Three young men from my local area were lucky enough to get work in the vicinity. Each of them tried to buy a car but the insurance costs were greater than the purchase price of the cars. They are all in England now because that is the only place where they could find work while depending on public transport. In rural areas there is no public transport and the continuing astronomical cost of car insurance prevents people staying in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of things the Minister of State could and should do. He should request the Competition Authority to carry out a study into competition issues in the motor insurance industry under section 11 of the Competition Act. He could consider the establishment of an independent insurance ombudsman who is not paid for by the insurance industry. Many people who look for insurance now are not even quoted. There is <Col N="1175" /> a cartel in this industry. If an independent ombudsman were established the situation could be investigated fairly. This does not happen at present.</P>
    <P>Many small family-run businesses have contacted me in the last couple of months about the massive cost of insurance. There were increases of over 50% and 60% last year. Some places are expecting an increase of up to 100% this year. No small business, or even a medium business, can sustain this. Not only is the cost great but there will be job losses, unfortunately, unless something is done.</P>
    <P>Another issue that I find difficult to deal with is the insurance industry itself. I ask the Minister of State to investigate it. Many businesses have contacted me. One of them told me that an individual came into his shop and claimed the he fell and hurt his back. The shopkeeper wanted to go to court to state his view that the injury sustained did not merit the compensation sought, but his insurance company advised him to settle the case out of court. The businessman refused this and requested to go to court, but the insurance company would not agree. It settled out of court for £16,000 to the claimant. The businessman was mesmerised by this and the following year his insurance costs increased by 45%. It is no wonder the insurance companies do not want to go to court if they are settling at that level, but it is the customer who pays. That is grossly unfair. It is for that reason I believe there is a cartel in the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>We must be more aggressive. Until there is fair and equitable competition in the insurance industry, the difficulties outlined this evening will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed this matter with the Minister of State on more than one occasion over the past year and I am disappointed with the response tonight. It offers nothing that was not said six months ago.</P>
      <P>There are issues that could be examined. The Minister of State and everyone else connected with the insurance industry admit that 40% of claims paid out goes to the legal end of the business. It does not all go straight into the pockets of the legal people who employ others, but the injured party does not receive 40% of any pay out. It reminds me of the showband days when Big Tom got 40% and the sponsors on the door got 60%.</P>

We can talk about lobbies in this House &ndash; farmers, publicans, footballers, horse racing &ndash; but the legal lobby is the strongest and does not want to be touched. The <Col N="1176" /> Government and the Minister of State do not want to touch it.</P>

      <P>That is the reason there has been such a delay in dealing with the matter. The Minister of State said he will establish a personal injuries assessment board. Why has he not done so already? He has talked about it for a long time and there is nothing to stop him from doing so.</P>

      <P>There are outside factors; we all know what happened in the United States and that it put enormous pressure on the international insurance business, affecting business here and resulting in the insurance companies laying staff off. For the Minister of State to say, however, that the Government has reduced the number of fatal and other injuries on the roads is to appear cynical. There has been an improvement in the road system on which a large amount of money has been spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has singularly failed to address the issue of the spiralling cost of car insurance in the State. The long promised penalty points system will not be in place for a further 12 to 18 months, even though the Government was committed to having it in place by 1 January this year. The personal injuries assessment board, announced in March 2001, to address the high legal costs associated with insurance claims, will not be in place for a further 12 months. It will be at least 2004 before it deals with car insurance claims. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which is investigating the high cost of insurance, was due to report in June 2000. It is now two years behind schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has failed to take one step to address the high cost of insurance in the last four and a half years. It is strong on hot air, but weak on action. The Minister of State admitted in the Dáil earlier today that sectors of the car insurance market are profitable, including a section of the <Col N="1177" /> young drivers' market, but what has he done about it? The answer is very little. The cost of insurance has increased by more than 50% in the last three years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has turned a blind eye to the blocking of the work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board by the insurance industry. The board was established by the Minister of State, but has been blocked in its work by the lack of information furnished to it by the insurance industry and he has done nothing about it. He has paid lip-service to the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board. There has been a contraction in the market, with only five general insurers at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has sat on his hands for the last four and a half years. The Government could implement four basic steps in the next four months to address the cost of car insurance. The personal injuries assessment board must immediately deal with car insurance claims. The Government should introduce the penalty point system, the legislation for which has been gathering dust for 12 months. It should use the 2% levy collected off the backs of those paying insurance to train and educate young drivers. The Minister of State should commit himself to the establishment of a statutory insurance ombudsman to ensure there is an independent assessment of the rapid rise in the cost of car insurance. An insurance ombudsman is the only way we can access the information urgently needed to address the spiralling cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are legally obliged to quote anyone seeking insurance, but the high risk sectors, such as younger and elderly drivers, often receive astronomical quotations forcing them not to take out insurance. The industry uses these quotations to refuse insurance to young and elderly drivers. It picks figures from the sky and abuses the current legislation. The only way to put manners on it is to establish a statutory insurance ombudsman. The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, has been critical of the insurance industry. Road deaths and the number of accidents have decreased, but there has been no recognition of this by the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has had many opportunities to do something over the last four and a half years, but all he has done is produce report after report. Deputy Flanagan pointed out earlier today that the Minister of State cannot give one example of a decision he has taken to address the issue of car insurance. The Minister of State could not answer; neither can the Government. The young people who pay car insurance will answer the Government at the polls in the next few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Labour Party motion on the appalling developments in the insurance market. It pinpoints the failure of the <Col N="1178" /> Government to deal with escalating premia since it took office.</P>
      <P>There have been promises, commitments and committees to examine the matter but no action has been taken. The result is disastrous for business and young drivers.</P>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves. Nobody under 21 years of age can get a quotation for motor insurance cover in their own name. For example, a 21 year old male sought cover for a 1998, 988cc Nissan Micra. He was quoted &euro;4,449.19 for comprehensive cover and &euro;3,454.99 for third party fire and theft cover. For an equivalent female driver the premiums quoted were &euro;1,953.22 for comprehensive cover and &euro;1,660.32 for third party fire and theft cover. That represents a trebling of the premia for that category of driver in the last six or seven years. It requires serious investigation which, unfortunately, the Government has done nothing about. Is it any wonder that increasing numbers of young drivers have no cover and that there is an increasing burden on the Motor Insurance Bureau when they have an accident?</P>
      <P>Motor insurance cover has, on average, increased by 35% in 2001 and for certain categories of cover the increase has been 100%. An increase of 25% for 2002 has been announced and more will follow because, contrary to what the Minister of State has said, there is less competition in the market. Generali has withdrawn and the Independent Insurance Group has collapsed. There are no replacements, which is a worry for small businesses and for the motor insurance market.</P>
      <P>The collapse of the Independent Insurance Group has exacerbated the appalling situation for small businesses, especially with regard to employers' and public liability cover. Unlike the UK, there is no licensing arrangement here whereby the State could use some of the funds accumulated from the 2% levy, which has effectively become a tax on the motor insurance industry as it has achieved its original purpose of providing financial help to mitigate the collapse of the PMPA. Many small businesses will have to cease trading because of the escalating costs of insurance. I have come across many people in business, especially in small businesses, on a daily and weekly basis who mention this problem to me.</P>
      <P>The Government's response is callous and demonstrates it is out of touch with the problems being created by rapidly increasing costs in the insurance sector. The Small Firms Association and ISME now publicly speak on the matter. They would not do so unless it was a serious issue for their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing will be done by the Government to deal with the legal and court costs associated with claims as well as the liability accidents that give rise to large claims because it is too beholden to vested interests. Legal and court costs contribute enormously to the cost of claims, and engineers, doctors and those in the legal profession have a <Col N="1179" /> vested interest in keeping this gravy train going. The country and the Government must tackle this problem if we are serious about creating better competition, bringing more insurance companies into the market and reducing the costs associated with claims. After four and a half years in office and unprecedented resources at its disposal I can only conclude that this Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government is satisfied to leave things as they are and allow people, be they young drivers or in business, to continue to suffer from high costs and lack of competition in the insurance and business market.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister of State blaming the events of 11 September or saying certain companies have pulled out of the market. Others will do so if the State does not regulate it as it should. There is no point in the Government telling us what it will do. It has been in office for four and a half years and it must explain what it did in that time when it had the opportunity to act. The Minister of State has run out of ideas. In the meantime, businesses and young motorists must pay more and shut up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me and I compliment Deputy Rabbitte for introducing this motion. It is very timely because there is a crisis in the insurance industry. Young people find it impossible to get car or motorcycle insurance or any mode of cover that will give them transport to and from work. Many examples have been quoted in this debate.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to believe that young people, some of them graduating from university to well paid jobs, who need a car for their work and who have the money to pay for the car are crippled by the insurance costs. It is totally unacceptable and it must be addressed. Will the Government outline what it has done to address this problem? I am long enough a Member of this House to know it has been present for a long time and is increasing. Even the cost of putting young people on motor insurance cover as named drivers is prohibitive. It costs in excess of £1,000 to do so, or £20 per week, which is enormous.</P>
      <P>Employers are experiencing great difficulties with regard to employers and public liability insurance. The Small Firms Association wrote to its members on the issue outlining that it met with the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Taoiseach to inform them of the very serious nature of the problem. What has happened since then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its letter the SFA says that insurance costs increased by an average of 41% in 2001 and the prospect is for a further 50% increase in 2002. It goes on to point out that if this situation is not resolved many companies will not be in a position to trade. A progressive family business in my area with approximately 60 employees had an insurance bill of &euro;63,000 in 2000. Last year the quote for insurance cover amounted to &euro;110,000 <Col N="1180" /> and for this year it will be &euro;180,000. In three years the company's insurance costs have almost trebled. Although there is a serious injury claim against the company it begs the question why insurance is being paid in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I know of one person who uses his car for business purposes and who has paid approximately &euro;4,000 per annum for his insurance. Although he was involved in an accident that was not his fault &ndash; there was no claim against him &ndash; he has been quoted &euro;13,000 for insurance cover for the coming year. How can he be expected to continue in business with costs of that nature? It is impossible, yet what is being done about it?</P>
    <P>We can point to higher claims but in the letter to its members the SFA says that a recent survey analysis shows the rate of accidents among small businesses has fallen but costs associated with them have soared. It points out that 76% of respondents said their claims experience had not changed, 15% said their claims experience had improved and 9% indicated an increase in claims. Yet, there have been huge increases in the cost of insurance cover. The letter goes on to say this must stop before thousands of people are put out of business and tens of thousands are made unemployed. What has the Minister done to address the problems experienced by the private sector in relation to ordinary car insurance and by the business community in relation to employers' liability and public liability and the huge costs associated with it? When will the Minister outline to the House his achievements in that area?</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister for Education and Science to immediately approve the appointment of a design team for Ballyclerihan national school, County Tipperary. Ballyclerihan village is expanding rapidly. In the past five years there has been significant housing development, both local authority and private housing, where in excess of 100 houses have been built in the village. The village has been designated in the county development plan as a centre of expansion and has its own development plan which is being statutorily approved. In that plan the population increase is estimated at 900 over the next five years and 1,500 over the next ten years. It will be appreciated that Ballyclerihan is a vibrant village expanding at an enormous rate.</P>
      <P>A new school was built in the village in 1996 and on its opening was too small. An extension was built in 1998 and again on its opening was too small to cater for the number of students attending. A further extension was applied for in 1999. That is the extension that is being dealt with and for which I ask the Minister to appoint a design team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" />The school is completely overcrowded and its facilities are totally inadequate for modern teaching and learning in this day and age. The school has 117 pupils, a staffing level of four teachers, a learning support teacher and a resource teacher. It was so overcrowded that in September 2001 the 25 pupils of third and fourth classes had to move to the local parish hall a quarter of a mile away. In that hall the 25 pupils are taught by a single teacher with no supports whatever. That teacher is isolated from the school and should any untoward incident occur, serious issues on health and safety grounds would be raised. The learning support teacher has to teach the pupils in the kitchen area of the hall. Families are split. Some children attend the parish hall while other family members attend the school. If the teacher is sick or otherwise engaged the pupils have to be taken back to the school and into already overcrowded classrooms.</P>
    <P>In the main school, the small library storage area is used as a teaching area, as is the staff room. There is no general purposes room or a PE room. There is no PE except when the weather is favourable. Lunches are eaten in the classrooms.</P>
    <P>There is a need for two classrooms, a general purposes room, a principal's office, a staff room, staff toilets, a parents' room and storage facilities. The board of management and the parents are frustrated by the lack of action on the part of the Minister and request that a design team be appointed immediately. It appears the Minister has not allowed the consultants' advisory committee, which recommends the appointment of design teams, to meet since last April, nine months ago. Since then no design team has been appointed, certainly not to Ballyclerihan.</P>
    <P>The board of management and the parents are a progressive team and are prepared to do all in their power to meet the Minister more than half way to ensure the extension is built for their sons and daughters, the pupils of the school. I specifically ask the Minister to immediately approve the appointment of the design team and to meet representatives of the board of management at Ballyclerihan national school.</P>

      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came to office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>There are more than 450 major primary school building projects in architectural planning. A proposed building project at St. Michael's national school, Ballyclerihan, will also proceed to architectural planning, as soon as it is possible to do so, under the Government's expanded building programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Mary's College, Mullingar, has a long, proud and distinguished record of providing second level education in Mullingar. The Heevy Institute was established in Mullingar more than 150 years ago by the Irish Christian Brothers and these brothers and an expanding lay staff have provided a top class education to successive generations of young men in the Mullingar area. More recently young ladies also attend as students at St. Mary's College.</P>
      <P>A new school to accommodate 350 pupils was built in 1971. This quickly became inadequate to accommodate the enrolment. In 1994, a lift to facilitate wheelchair access to the upper level of this school was sanctioned by the Department with an allocation of £100,000. This work was not proceeded with nor has the money been drawn down, rather these works are to be incorporated into a new extension to this school which has been on the books since 1995. Since that date the Department has acknowledged that a school with capacity for 600 students was required. A design team was appointed in 1996 and over the next couple of years, various design options were explored and site examination was completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By 1999, a particular design option was agreed, incorporating a technology and woodwork room, a new science laboratory, a music room, a tiered lecture room, general classrooms etc. and stage <Col N="1183" /> four and five submission was made to the Department in May 2001.</P>
    <P>Shamefully, despite weekly phone calls to the Department by the school principal, Mr. Joe O'Meara, the project remains submerged in the Department's offices in Tullamore. Is it a coincidence that the school received correspondence from the Department today when the Department knew this issue was to be raised in the House tonight? </P>
    <P>The situation is intolerable. The flat roofs leak, water flows on to the stairs and into the general purposes room and there are cramped and overcrowded conditions. The 39 staff and 603 students at the school deserve better. The building project is being delayed unnecessarily. It must be given immediate sanction to move to the tendering-building stage for the extension.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was to give the project the go ahead tonight, the builders could be on site in May and the building substantially under way by the time the students return in September. However, I fear what we will hear tonight is the same gobbledegook we hear night after night in relation to schools. The Minister of State will stand up and deliver a prepared script from the Department with little reference to the delay that has occurred at the school. Will the Minister of State tell us why the project has moved so slowly? Why has there been no response to the stage 4 and 5 design, even though the Department received it in May last year? I want a real response, not more of the gobbledegook we usually hear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important issue. I wish to bring to the attention of the House the conditions which some of our most distinguished schools have to endure by virtue of the failure of the Government to invest in education. I am sick listening to the one-for-all replies about 1997. They are convoluted nonsense. This is 2002, five years later.</P>
      <P>I refer specifically to St. Mary's College in Mullingar which I attended as a young boy. I and all the others who passed through the school are immensely proud of it. During a recent visit I was shocked and saddened by the very difficult conditions with which pupils and teachers at the school have to put up. I assured the young students I would raise the matter in the Oireachtas at the first opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Mary's College and other outstanding schools in our education system have been given the responsibility of providing the young upcoming generations with the secondary education needed for the continued development of the country. The college's teachers and students must set about this task while trying to prevent water leaking from the roof into the science laboratory, computer room and main stairwell. Teachers are forced to concern themselves with the possibility that flat roofs on classrooms will collapse. This <Col N="1184" /> should not be the case. How can we expect our schools to achieve and perform while such basic necessities and requirements are not being addressed? </P>
    <P>I use the word &ldquo;achieve&rdquo; with regard to St. Mary's in the context of the huge contribution the school has made in the local area for many years. It has an outstanding academic record as well as an incomparable record on the sports field, the most recent example of which was provided by two current students, Martin Fagan and Mark Christie, who are doing the county and country proud on the athletic field. Such achievements reflect a commitment to excellence among the students and teachers, which occurs in spite of the system, rather than because of it. They continue to maintain and improve the school's academic and sporting records with one hand tied behind their backs in terms of the educational investment and facilities available to the school.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the funding provided by the Christian Brothers and parents over the years, the position would be desperate, indeed, unsustainable. If we, as public representatives, want to continue drawing attention to the educated workforce we are turning out, we must start putting our money where our mouth is. While I admit to being less than totally objective on this issue, no educational institution warrants such investment more than St. Mary's College. I call on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to accelerate the programme of development in the school by immediately providing the extra accommodation it needs.</P>
    <P>The school recently put back into operational use classrooms which were withdrawn as obsolete and considered unsuitable for use when I attended the school in 1972. The school has more than 600 students and, as Deputy McGrath stated, is having to utilise every available space for classrooms. The conversion of cloakrooms and even bicycle sheds for classroom use is utterly unacceptable. I refer to this by way of an illustration of the desperate measures to which a fine school is resorting to try to provide the best possible education for its students.</P>
    <P>I salute the management, teachers and students of my <i>alma mater</i> and assure them I will continue to work on their behalf to try to get the facilities they merit. I call on the Minister to take the crisis requirements of this school seriously. It must be authorised to proceed to put its new building requirements out to tender as quickly as possible in order to enable the commencement of the new building programme to take place this summer. Nobody denies that due process must be followed to ensure all requirements specified by the Department and its building unit are met before tendering and building are allowed to commence, but there must also be flexibility in the system to deal with urgent, crisis, conditions such as those applicable in this case. I ask the Minister to deal with the exceptional circumstances prevailing in this school in an enlightened way and on an exceptional basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House our Department's current position regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>In February 1995 the Department received an application for additional accommodation from St. Mary's CBS, Mullingar, County Westmeath. As additional accommodation was sought, the Department's planning section projected a long-term enrolment figure for the school to determine the number of pupils it was likely to cater for in the future. A long-term enrolment of 600 pupils was projected. In June 1995, on foot of this projection, the school was asked to fill in an educational worksheet which was returned to the Department on 9 June 1995. Such a worksheet allows a school to illustrate the curricular provision it intends to provide for its long-term projected enrolment. Based on the long-term projected enrolment and completed educational worksheet, a schedule of overall accommodation was sent to the school on l0 July 1995. However, this was queried by the school and a revised schedule issued on 14 July 1995, which was accepted by the school on 19 July 1995.</P>
      <P>The schedules of residual accommodation and suggested future use were sent to the school in December 1995 and accepted. The schedules of accommodation set out the extent and type of accommodation needed by the school to make the curricular provision included on the educational worksheet for the long-term projected enrolment. As such, they provide the basis of the brief for the design team engaged to undertake the architectural planning of building at a school. On 17 January 1996 the building unit of the Department was therefore in a position to appoint a design team for the proposed extension to the school. The extra accommodation to be built was 950 square metres.</P>
      <P>In November 1996 the school authorities were given permission by the Department to appoint a design team. The school nominated design team was given the approval of the Department in January 1997. The school was asked to submit a stage 1, site suitability, briefing and site report submission of the Department's design team procedures, which was received in May 1997 after a site meeting. It was felt that structural investigations of the school building were required.</P>
      <P>The structural analysis report was received by the Department in October 1997 and a further report was received in February 1998. In April 1998 the school authorities were given permission to proceed to stage 2 of the design team procedures. In September 1998 the stage 2 submission was received. Due to slight changes in the parameters of the project &ndash; the area of the extension was increased from 950 square metres to 1,303.5 square metres &ndash; which became apparent as the architectural design proceeded, revised schedules of accommodation were agreed with the school in December 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1999 the school submitted drawings representing various proposed options for the <Col N="1186" /> design of the extension. Having considered these options, the Department gave the school permission to proceed to stage 3 in March 1999. The Department asked the school to submit a draft stage 3 proposal prior to the submission of the final stage 3. This was not done and the stage 3 submission was received by the building unit in September 1999.</P>
    <P>Some problems previously raised by our Department were not incorporated with the stage 3 submission as had been requested. This necessitated the Department asking the school's design team for a supplementary report. In January 2000 the school authorities were given permission to submit a combined stage 4 and 5 of the design team procedures, that is, detail design and bill of quantities. The school authorities submitted the stage 4 and 5 submission in May 2001, which was examined in the Department in conjunction with some extra work for which the school applied. It was felt advantageous from a financial point of view to amalgamate the projects.</P>
    <P>In November 2000 the school submitted a request for extra works, including new windows, to be included with the proposed extension. In April 2001 the school was asked to submit an architect's report on elements of the new application. This was submitted in July 2001 and in August 2001 the school was given permission to submit tender documentation in order that the new works might be included in the overall extension project. These were received in December 2001.</P>
    <P>The building unit of the Department wrote to the school authorities on 4 January 2002 in relation to their stage 4 and 5 submission requesting additional information from the design team. The building unit of the Department awaits a response from the school on the issues raised in that correspondence.</P>

      <P>Once again the prospect of school closures in our secondary sector looms large on the horizon and the Minister for Education and Science is again satisfied to play the role of onlooker while the prospects of thousands of students are affected in a protracted wrangle between the Government and teachers. Dissatisfaction among school teachers is growing. The ASTI has been joined in the dispute by the TUI, which also rejected the Government's offer on payment for supervision and substitution. The deal was narrowly accepted by the INTO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These ballots are much more than straws in the wind. They reflect the reality of considerable unease, unhappiness and discontent among all teachers. Where is the forum on education suggested by my colleague and former spokesperson on education, Deputy Kenny, which was accepted by the Minister, but not acted on? This would serve as a measure to rebuild partnership in education and a forum for consultation with teachers <Col N="1187" /> to express their real concerns about life at the coal face in our schools.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister share my belief that if he fails to resolve this dispute before 4 March he will do enormous, perhaps irreparable, damage to the spirit of co-operation and partnership in education in our schools? Teachers are undoubtedly the best people to do supervision and substitution. Well intentioned third parties cannot do the job as well as teachers and may unintentionally damage the quality of education in certain schools.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the Minister's contingency plan. Where is it? What communications has he had with individual school authorities to date? What are the instructions he has issued regarding the funding available to them and the terms of employment that may be offered to individuals to undertake supervision and substitution? He cannot guarantee that life will continue unaltered, no matter what his contingency plan may be, in all schools after 4 March. I urge him to use his time between now and that date judiciously, to renegotiate with the teacher unions and use the industrial relations machinery of the State at his disposal. He should not, for the second year running, allow students to face uncertainty as they face a critical time in their school year. He should facilitate the maintenance of harmony in our staff rooms and not pit principals against their staff members. I urge him to act now before irreparable damage is done to our education system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify our Department's position on this matter. The issue of supervision and substitution was highlighted during the ASTI industrial action on its 30% pay claim. During the Labour Court consideration of the issues involved in that dispute it was agreed that the issues surrounding supervision and substitution should be addressed at the Teachers Conciliation Council as they were ones which affected all teachers.</P>
      <P>Following negotiations under the aegis of the Teachers Conciliation Council, a final formal offer of &euro;34.28 per hour for supervision and substitution was put to the three teacher unions. The Irish National Teachers Organisations put the offer to ballot and it was accepted by a majority of its members. The Teachers Union of Ireland put the offer to ballot and it was rejected by a small majority. The ASTI recently put the offer to ballot and it was rejected. The standing committee of the ASTI has now indicated that it will instruct its members to withdraw from supervision and substitution duties with effect from 4 March 2002. However, it has also emphasised that the ASTI does not wish schools to be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has confirmed that he will provide funding for schools to allow arrangements to be made for adequate supervision and substitution. Funding will be in line with the current proposals for payment for supervision and substitution. Officials of our <Col N="1188" /> Department have been in discussions with the school management bodies for some time in relation to the contingency arrangements which might be implemented by individual schools. The school management bodies are committed to taking all possible steps to put in place alternative arrangements for the delivery of supervision and substitution so as to avoid the closure of schools as a result of the ASTI action. The Minister will provide every assistance possible for individual school managements to prevent disruption to the education of students. The school management bodies continue to be in consultation with our Department in relation to the engagement of suitable personnel to undertake supervision and substitution duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has made it clear that there will be no improvement on the present offer of &euro;34.28 per hour which has been accepted by the INTO. Discussions with the three teacher unions continue within the Teachers Conciliation Council in an effort to find a solution to any outstanding issues. The Minister's main priority is to fully support school managements in their efforts to ensure the education of our young people is not disrupted. However, he appeals to the ASTI to consider again the impact of its action in creating a climate of anxiety and apprehension in our schools.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this matter to be raised. I regret having to table this Adjournment request and the Minister of State come here to reply. It is, if one likes, a drastic challenge to the Adjournment debate structure in that the question is clear, but the answer has probably been drafted long before the Minister of State stands up to give her reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding orthodontics and the public orthodontic service is nothing short of a national scandal. The Joint Committee on Health and Children has been dealing with this matter for a period of time and done a great deal of work under the chairmanship of Deputy Batt O'Keeffe of the main Government party. There has been a failure on the part of successive Governments and Ministers to deal with the problem. Parent X may go to see the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who I am glad to see here, to say his or her child has a problem with his or her teeth which he or she regards as orthodontic. The child is assessed and if put on a list in the public service, may well wait for five to six years in the Western Health Board area before treatment is delivered. It is completely unethical and immoral to put children on lists for orthodontic treatment in the sure knowledge that they will never be called or that their parents will be forced to pay through the private sector. I am appalled at the failure of this and previous Ministers to take on the Dublin and Cork Dental Schools and their failure to recog<Col N="1189" /> nise, and be shielded from, the reality of the powerful cabal operating here preventing the provision of an effective public orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>A number of guidelines are being bandied about in terms of the criteria laid down for eligibility for children. When we had no public orthodontic service guidelines were laid down in 1985 by the Department of Health which were accepted. In a reply in November and again last week the Minister pointed out that the health board consultants recommended a number of changes in the interim which was followed by a recommendation known as the Moran report from the chief executive officers of the health boards based on a system of IOTN, index of orthodontic treatment need.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to tell the House which of these guidelines is now in operation. Are we talking solely about the 1985 guidelines? The Minister said in reply that the consultant orthodontists sent a report to him. He did not say whether he accepted it, but that his Department was writing to the health boards about changes. He did not say either whether the Moran report index is being used to any extent.</P>
    <P>I quoted at the joint committee minutes of a meeting held between the Irish consultant orthodontists group and the Orthodontic Society of Ireland held in Dublin on 18 September 2000. The minutes are very clear in that they show that the private sector would be largely eliminated if an indexing system was introduced that was defensible both on a constitutional and legal basis because otherwise the hospital service would be overwhelmed with patients it would never be able to treat. That is taken from the minutes of a group meeting in September 2000 in terms of the relationship between the Orthodontic Society of Ireland and the ICOG.</P>
    <P>I recognise private practice and the work it does, but the Minister of State represents the Government. There are hundreds of thousands of mothers, fathers and children who are not receiving this service and there is great confusion about eligibility and the guidelines being used. Will the Minister of State explain whether the 1985 guidelines alone are now being used? If not, has the Minister accepted the consultant orthodontists recommendations of interim changes? Are these the guidelines being used? While the study is being carried out by the Department, are there elements of the IOTN or Moran index being used? Whatever is going on, thousands of children are being eliminated from orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times have increased. This is grossly unethical, unfair and immoral.</P>
    <P>The Minister said to me in the House, I think in November, if there was one other thing he would do during his remaining period in office it would be that he would sort this matter out. If nothing else happens between now and the time the Taoiseach goes to the country, the Government and the Minister should zero in on this scandal and sort it out once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for raising the matter of the guidelines for orthodontic treatment operated by the Department of Health and Children and for allowing me this opportunity to discuss the provision of orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. In 1985, the Department issued guidelines to health boards on the criteria applicable in assessing priority of need for specialist orthodontic treatment &ndash; the guidelines are based on the degree of severity of malocclusion and they are still in operation. Their purpose is to allow prioritisation of children for orthodontic treatment based on the severity of need.</P>
      <P>The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way patients in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care &ndash; patients assessed as category B have less severe problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists. The number of cases treated will depend on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in an area.</P>
      <P>Health board consultant orthodontists recommended that the 1985 guidelines be modified to prioritise treatment for the most severe categories of patients. The Department of Health and Children will be writing to the chief executive officers of the health boards concerning the operation of these modified guidelines with regard to maintaining the delivery of orthodontic services in a prioritised way.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer's report on orthodontics, known as the Moran report, recommended the use of an alternative index of need which, as Deputy Kenny said, is known as the index of orthodontic treatment need. The chief dental officer has advised that this new index should not be implemented until its implications have been evaluated in a national survey of children's dental health. This survey is currently under way and is expected to be completed in mid-2002. The purpose of the survey is to identify accurately the number of children who would benefit from orthodontic treatment and the resources, particularly manpower, needed to meet the corresponding level of care.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, has taken a personal interest in the whole area of orthodontics and has initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting time for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" />The Department has provided additional funding of almost &euro;1 million for orthodontic services in 2002, over half of which was for a specialist training programme. Six dentists from the health boards commenced their training for specialist in orthodontic qualifications last October. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    <P>The Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Department has funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.3 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit <Col N="1192" /> there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced an orthodontic initiative last year and an additional &euro;6.73 million was provided for orthodontic services of which &euro;4.7 million was for this initiative. Among other things, this funding allowed health boards to recruit additional staff.</P>
    <P>Returns from health boards indicate that some progress is being made. At the end of 2001, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment &ndash; the equivalent figure reported for mid-1999 was 14,209 patients, implying an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment over that period.</P>
    <P>The health boards are striving hard to improve their orthodontic services. The Minister is confident that the orthodontic initiative, combined with the structural changes being introduced, will lead to significant increases in the numbers being treated by the orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 February 2002.</P>

      <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directives in 1994, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries. In addition, I believe that the removal of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The decision of this Government to establish a Personal Injuries Assessment Board seeks to address the issue of the high cost of settling claims by achieving a reduction in the delivery cost of personal injury compensation. This should make the marketplace more attractive and encourage more entrants.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board &ndash; MIAB &ndash; is in the process of completing its work. I expect to receive the final report during the coming month. We will examine the board's recommendations as a matter of urgency when received, with the intention of bringing proposals to Government and publishing the report.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, however, the pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in respect of either.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The new procedures which have been put in place by my Department pertaining to immigrant workers were introduced in light of recent changes in the economic climate in Ireland and internationally and an increase in the level of unemployment. They are designed to ensure that employers are making all reasonable efforts to recruit locally or through the wider EEA market before looking to employ non-EEA nationals, by obliging employers to register job vacancies with FÁS before making a work permit application.</P>
      <P>These new arrangements came into operation on 2 January 2002, and as job vacancies can take some four to six weeks to process through FÁS, it is too early yet to measure the impact of the new system in sourcing Irish-EEA staff. However, I am satisfied that the new procedures are an appropriate policy response to the changed labour market. The implementation of the new arrangements will be monitored closely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dignity in the Workplace Charter originates from a recommendation of the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the charter is to facilitate the management and the staff of any and every employment in the country to make a public commitment to provide a workplace free of bullying, and to develop policies and procedures that underpin the principles and objectives of the charter.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the adoption of the charter is not a statutory or compulsory requirement on an employer, but is voluntary. On this basis, therefore, there is no system in place whereby employers register for the charter or where a record is maintained of the number of employers who adopt the charter.</P>
      <P>I have, however, been informed by the Health and Safety Authority, which is the central co-ordinating State agency overseeing the implementation of the task force recommendations, that, to date, it has distributed over 16,000 copies of the charter. The authority anticipates that a high level of demand for copies of the charter will continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, in view of my initiative in setting up the task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, asked the authority to ensure particularly that, given the lead role and example which the <Col N="1195" /> State should play in this regard, all Departments and State Agencies be circulated with copies of the charter.</P>
    <P>In addition, the charter has been endorsed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Construction Industry Federation. Each of these organisations is supporting the charter by promoting its adoption by its constituent members and by facilitating its distribution amongst members. This endorsement gives the charter much impact and credibility not least because of the wide spectrum of interests which these organisations collectively represent.</P>
    <P>It is, however, important to emphasise the charter is only one element of the strategy to prevent workplace bullying. It is not an end in itself and does not replace the appropriateness and necessity of employers having specific preventative and procedural measures in place to address workplace bullying.</P>
    <P>The task force report recognised that both sides of industry have a primary role to play in combating workplace bullying. The report clearly states that &ldquo;central to the concept of an effective workplace is the commitment of management and workforce to develop and maintain an atmosphere in which the dignity of each individual is respected.&rdquo;. Adoption of the Dignity in the Workplace Charter is an appropriate way in which an enterprise can make commit itself to the establishment of such an effective workplace and a significant step in developing a positive bullying prevention strategy.</P>

      <P>The Office of the Attorney General has considerable doubts as to whether &ldquo;gifting schemes&rdquo; are covered by the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980. The difficulty lies in the application of the Act to the provision of &ldquo;goods or services, or both&rdquo;. As neither goods nor services appear to be involved in these types of schemes, the prohibition provisions in the 1980 Act appear not to be applicable. The gardaí who enforce the Act take the view that these schemes are not covered by the Act. I am aware of the Deputy's Private Members' Bill on the subject and my Department is studying it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difficulty with any legislation seeking to deal with a complex problem of this kind is to steer a course between making very specific provisions which may be circumvented by future developments of the targeted schemes and, on the other hand, catching bone fide arrangements such <Col N="1196" /> as savings and spending schemes. We are, however, still exploring the legislative option as well as administrative steps that might be taken.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I would repeat my previous warnings that people should be extremely cautious in investing their money in schemes which appear to be too good to be true.</P>

      <P>The current position on the transposition of EU Directives for which my Department is responsible indicates a total of 25 directives to be implemented, including six for which the deadline for implementation has passed. Details of the directives are available on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie/ecd/eudirectives.</P>
      <P>A letter of formal notice, under Article 226 of the treaty, has been issued by the European Commission in the case of three of the outstanding directives for which the deadline for implementation has passed. In addition, certain aspects of the transposition measures introduced to give effect to two directives &ndash; dating, respectively, from 1987 and 1989 &ndash; are also the subject of legal action by the European Commission. My Department is in communication with the Commission with regard to the issues concerned.</P>
      <P>At any point in time there will be a number of other directives in respect of which legal proceedings had commenced, but where the directives in question have since been transposed. The legal proceedings in these instances usually lapse although their formal withdrawal may take a long time to complete. No systematic record of such directives is kept since it would serve no useful purpose to do so. The Commission may on occasion, notwithstanding the fact that the directive has been transposed, proceed with a referral to the European Court of Justice and this has occurred in one such recent case.</P>

      <P>The report in question, Labour Market Participation of the Over 55s in Ireland, was commissioned by Forfás on behalf of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and the National Competitiveness Council. The report looks at ways of increasing the participation in the labour force of that group and makes a number of policy recommendations including: (1) measures to increase the awareness of the importance of older workers; (2) measures to facilitate flexible working practices; (3) identification and reduction of disincentives to gradual retirement that may be embedded in pension schemes or taxation arrangements; (4) measures to combat age discrimination.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report require consideration across a number of areas of Government policy, including pensions, taxation, equality, promotion of employment and training. There are currently no plans for any pilot projects on foot of the findings of the Forfás report.</P>
      <P>At present, FÁS engages directly with older unemployed persons that are referred by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs under the Government's employment action plan as they reach a nine-month duration of unemployment. The aim of this approach is to prevent the drift into long-term unemployment by providing suitable job opportunities, training or other employment supports.</P>
      <P>With regard to Donegal, since 1998 FÁS has responded to factory closures by implementing a process of individual interaction with each interested worker who has been made redundant. This interaction takes the form of a quality registration interview. The process enables FÁS to carry out a skills and training needs analysis, which it uses to set up training initiatives that are matched to both the worker's needs and to the identified needs of local industry. The skills analysis produced by FÁS is made available to all the relevant bodies in Donegal to assist in the attraction of new industry. For the client, a dedicated employment services officer puts a personal action plan in place. This action plan takes the form of training, retraining, work practice; a job or other employability measures.</P>

      <Quest> the number of deaths and injuries reported during 2001 as a result of accidents in the construction industry; the progress made to date in ensuring improved safety standards in the sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health &ndash; known as the Health and Safety Authority &ndash; is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day to day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by, and obtainable directly from, the authority. I have, however, been informed by the authority that there were 22 construction related fatalities in 2001, of which 14 were workers in the construction sector, four were members of the public and four were others involved in construction activities. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work reported to date to the authority, for 2001 is 1,115.</P>
      <P>The management of health and safety standards in the construction sector, as in all sectors of employment, requires the fulfilment of their respective responsibilities and duties by all parties concerned. There is already in existence a strong occupational health and safety legislative code, including detailed regulations dealing specifically with the construction sector, which is enforced in a pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>In 2002, the Health and Safety Authority intends to carry out 7,000 construction inspections with an emphasis on the management of safety, including safety representation, safe pass training implementation, welfare facilities, safe working at heights and site traffic management. In addition to inspections the authority intends to publish codes of practice on roof work, cranes and underground services. These codes will add to the existing construction sector specific codes of practice.</P>
      <P>However, it is a continuance of the partnership approach to safety, as embodied by the construction safety partnership, CSP, which is crucial in underpinning ongoing improvements in safety standards in the construction sector.</P>
      <P>The CSP, which is composed of representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU as well as the HSA and other relevant Departments/agencies, is working to a detailed three-year plan to improve safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry. The plan contains a range of measures to improve safety consultation and safety representation, safety training and the introduction of safety management systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment, the CSP has overseen significant progress in a number of areas, including the initiation of the safety representatives pilot project which is a highly commendable joint <Col N="1199" /> ICTU/CIF project and which has resulted in the provision of training for over 200 safety representatives to date. Other areas of progress include the undertaking of a major training programme for safety officers and safety managers, the establishment of a joint ICTU/CIF safety council to collaborate on information, promotion and research activities and, most recently, the development of amendments to the construction regulations.</P>
    <P>These legislative amendments took effect on a phased basis from 1 January of this year. They are extremely significant in that they introduce, for the first time, the concepts of &ldquo;mandatory safety training&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory safety representation&rdquo; while also providing for better on-site welfare facilities. A further full review of the construction regulations is also under way under the auspices of the CSP.</P>
    <P>In addition, legislative proposals to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, are currently being developed at departmental level. Pertinent issues of offences and penalties will be addressed in this context with a view to strengthening those provisions. A strengthened and updated Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, will be of benefit to all sectors of employment, including the construction sector.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the revised construction regulations, the State continues to play its role in the effort to improve health and safety standards in the construction sector, through the provision of a strong legislative base and the provision of the associated training, advisory, inspection and enforcement services.</P>

      <P>The provision of jobs is a day to day matter for the development agencies and not one for which I, as Minister, would have a direct function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Forfás annual employment survey for 2001 shows that new full-time jobs created in firms supported by the agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland and <Col N="1201" /> Enterprise Ireland &ndash; amounted to 27,328, while job losses in these firms came to 30,142 for the year, giving an overall reduction of 2,814. The figures for Shannon Development amount to 1,810 jobs created, with 2,508 job losses, giving an overall reduction of 698 in 2001. Figures are not yet available for the county enterprise boards-assisted companies. While precise figures are not available for the period from June to December, the overall economic situation was characterised by strong growth in the first part of the year, giving way to a sharp deceleration as the year progressed. Inevitably, therefore, the job losses were concentrated towards the latter part of the year.</P>
    <P>New job creation was evenly split between Irish-owned and foreign-owned firms. In addition, 2001 showed an improved regional balance of job creation, with the BMW region accounting for 25% of gross job gains, compared to 17% in 1999 and 20% in 2000.</P>
    <P>The net reduction in employment last year should be seen in the context of the world-wide slowdown, the incidence of foot and mouth disease, the downturn in the ICT sector, and the tragic events of September in the United States of America. It should also be borne in mind that total employment in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors has increased by around 50% in the ten years since 1992. The years of record growth may be at an end for now but Ireland is performing very strongly in comparison to European economies.</P>
    <P>The 2001 outcome nevertheless reinforces the need for firms in Ireland to increase their competitiveness and re-position in market sectors with greater potential for profitable growth. The strategies of the enterprise development agencies are now firmly fixed on building and providing the infrastructure for high value-added and knowledge-intensive industries. In addition, the Government will continue to focus on enhancing the country's skills base, improving our infrastructure network, shaping the regulatory environment and encouraging companies to move up the value chain. There will continue to be challenges in the year ahead, but many vacancies still exist in the economy and I am confident that, going forward, the Government's policies will be successful in minimising the effects of the difficulties experienced in 2001 with new jobs continuing to be created across a wide range of sectors.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report in question.</P>
      <P>Construction apprentices enjoy the same statutory protection under employment rights legislation as all other employees. In addition, the working conditions of construction apprentices are governed by the terms of the Registered Employment Agreements &ndash; Construction Industry Wages and Conditions of Employment and Construction Industry Pensions Assurance and Sick Pay). The Industrial Relations Acts, 1946-1990, provide for complaint to the Labour Court, by both trade unions and employers, in circumstances of alleged breaches of these agreements. Inspectors of my Department will investigate individual complaints of any infringements of the particular agreements or any other relevant employment rights entitlements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 89 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The report in question, Labour Market Participation of the Over 55s in Ireland, was commissioned by Forfás on behalf of the expert group on future skills needs and the National Competitiveness Council. The report looks at ways of increasing the participation in the labour force of that group and makes a number of policy recommendations including: measures to increase the awareness of the importance of older workers; measures to facilitate flexible working practices; identification and reduction of disincentives to gradual retirement that may be embedded in pension schemes or taxation arrangements; and measures to combat age discrimination.</P>
      <P>Ireland had an employment rate of 45.3% for the 55 to 64 year old age group in 2000 compared to an EU average of 37.7%. The EU has set a target of 50% for 2010, recognising the propensity for people to live longer and the changing demographics resulting from declining birth rates and older people constituting a growing portion of the population.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, we will face a similar decrease in the share of younger people and a growing share of older people in the coming decade, with implications for labour supply and sustainability of pensions. This report is therefore very timely and the recommendations will need to be considered across a number of areas of Government policy including pensions, taxation, equality, promotion of employment and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My prevailing view is that our policies in this area have to be governed by the overriding principle of choice. People of a certain age and circumstances should be able to choose if they want to work - be it part-time, full-time or voluntarily &ndash; or whether they want to take advantage of the <Col N="1205" /> benefits which they have earned over their working life to date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is the national paying authority for the European Social Fund, ESF, in Ireland. It is also the managing authority for the Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme and for the EQUAL Community Initiative Programme, both co-funded by the ESF. In addition, ESF is used to part-fund some employment related measures in the two regional operational programmes, BMW and S&amp;E, and the PEACE II programme. In order to assist my Department in ensuring that ESF money is spent correctly, in accordance with both national and EU regulatory requirements, it was decided to set up a functionally independent ESF financial control unit in May 1999. The control unit is tasked with ensuring full compliance with the requirements of the European regulations in so far as ESF expenditure in Ireland is concerned. Under my signature, the manager and controllers of the FCU are authorised officers under Regulation 3(1)(<i>b</i>) of the European Communities (Financial Checks) Regulations 1999 (S.I. No. 123 of 1999), and are empowered to carry out checks on all ESF co-funded expenditure in Ireland. The unit is also required to provide advice to the paying authority on the proper management and control of ESF-funded operations, in accordance with the relevant EU regulations; devise and conduct an annual audit programme; issue audit reports as appropriate; engage on an ongoing basis with the appropriate officials in my Department.</P>
      <P>The work programme of the unit is agreed and overseen by a steering committee. The unit is co-funded through ESF technical assistance.</P>
      <P>While the unit is functionally independent in terms of its audit work, it comes within the remit of my Department for administrative purposes. Appointments to the financial control unit are on a temporary contract basis and the posts are subject to Civil Service regulations and all other Acts in force relating to employment in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" />The financial control unit's audit reports are sent to the ESF paying authority and the internal audit unit in my Department and to the European Commission. Any follow-up required is the responsibility of my Department as national paying authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest quarterly national household survey for the third quarter 2001 shows that the unemployment rate increased to 4.3%, or 79,500 persons, from 3.7% in the previous quarter. The current rate of 4.3% is the same as it was 12 months previously and compares with a rate of 10.3% in 1997.</P>
      <P>The long-term unemployment rate remained static at 1.2% or 22,100 persons in the third quarter of 2001. In the same quarter a year earlier, the LTU rate was 1.4%, while in 1997 it was 5.6%. The latest seasonally adjusted live register total for January 2002 is 156,300. This compares with 138,100 a year earlier and 263,900 in January 1997.</P>
      <P>In 2001, there was a significant turnaround in the live register, with substantial monthly falls in each of the previous three years being halted. The bulk of the live register increase has taken place since September 2001. Employment increased by 48,700 in the year to the third quarter of 2001. The latest employment figure of 1,786,600 compares with 1,379,900 in 1997. The Department of Finance in its stability programme forecasts employment growth of 1.4% and an unemployment rate of 4.75% in 2002.</P>
      <P>The recent increase in unemployment is due in the main to global economic factors such as the fallout from the atrocities in the US on 11 September and the downturn in the technological sector. There is a general view that unemployment will rise in 2002 but that good economic and employment growth will return in the medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As notified in Ireland's employment action plan, EAP, 2001, the main elements of employment policy are to promote employment growth and employment for all who seek it; to mobilise labour supply, including through increased female participation, equal opportunities and a balanced increase in immigration, in order to contribute to a consistent, strong, sustainable and non-inflationary level of economic growth; to enhance labour quality through education, training and in particular lifelong learning in order to strengthen the employability of individuals and to promote competitiveness and adaptability in firms; to promote the economic and social inclusion of excluded persons, eliminate long-<Col N="1207" /> term unemployment and prevent future drift into long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Given that the rise in unemployment from historically low levels is expected to be short-term, and that good employment growth is expected to resume over the medium term, I intend to continue to pursue these policies.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there will be challenges in the next year as jobs are lost and workers seek new employment, but the medium-term labour market forecast remains positive and I am confident that Ireland will continue to create new jobs in manufacturing, construction and services in the period ahead. FÁS, which has a budget of &euro;870 million in 2002, will continue to work to ensure that anyone who is seeking employment will have the opportunity and skills to do so. FÁS is well placed to prevent skills that become available through redundancies being lost to the economy and to put people who become unemployed in touch with job opportunities quickly.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the underwriting of insurance risks and the setting of premiums, including for motor insurance, are matters for judgment by individual private insurance companies and EU law prevents us from intervening directly in the matter.</P>
      <P>Motor insurance premiums are normally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, for particular risks and classes of risk. It is reasonable to question why motor insurance premiums should be increasing in an environment where, for example, the number of motorists is increasing, while at the same time, accident rates are declining.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors to explain increases in premiums. These include the high cost of settling claims, High Court decisions that require insurers to strengthen reserves for claims arising in past years and increases in reinsurance prices that they must pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, is in the process of completing its work, which included an examination of the cost of motor insurance for young drivers. I expect to receive the final report of the board in the next month. I will examine the board's recommendations as a matter of urgency when received, with the inten<Col N="1208" /> tion of bringing proposals to Government thereafter.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority has identified the pursuit of cartels as a top priority. Cartel behaviour is by its very nature conspiratorial and harmful to consumers as it results in their having to pay more than they should for goods and services. Participants in cartels are secretive and experience has shown in other jurisdictions that hard-core cartels are notoriously difficult to detect and prosecute successfully.</P>
      <P>The authority investigates alleged breaches of the Competition Acts. The Director of Public Prosecutions has sole responsibility for prosecuting offences on indictment. The Competition Authority had been working for some time with the Director of Public Prosecutions on the development of a cartel immunity programme and on 20 December 2001, it announced, in conjunction with the director, the introduction of such a programme.</P>
      <P>The programme outlines the policy and procedures involved in applying for immunity from prosecution for criminal offences under the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996. The programme makes transparent the policy of both the authority and the Director of Public Prosecutions in considering applications for immunity in cases of self-reporting of cartel activity. It also outlines the process through which parties must agree to co-operate in order to qualify for immunity. It encourages self-reporting of unlawful cartels by offenders at the earliest possible stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for immunity must be made to the designated officer in the authority. Subject to the applicant's full compliance with the programme, the authority will make a recommendation to the <Col N="1209" /> DPP to grant immunity. It is, of course, at the DPP's discretion as to whether immunity is granted or not. Details of the authority's cartel immunity programme are available on the website of the authority, www.tca.ie.</P>

      <P>I should point out first of all that the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Convention on Cyber-crime will be an important element in the fight against serious crime, in particular crimes using information communications technologies, ICTs, and crimes such as hacking or virus creation, which impact on the legitimate use of ICTs.</P>
      <P>As with all criminal justice measures, a balance must be struck between the need for such measures on the one hand and the need to protect the rights of businesses and citizens on the other. When the convention is signed, it will be examined in detail with a view to bringing forward any necessary legislative measures.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform consulted my Department during the discussions leading to the adoption of the convention. I expect my Department to have further discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in due course, particularly about the scope of the convention and the safeguards that will be required to accompany its transposition into Irish law.</P>

      <P>The powers available to me to refer industrial disputes to the Labour Court are restricted to circumstances where the public interest is affected or where the disputes are of special importance. Those powers, rightly in my opinion, have been used sparingly. In the circumstances of the dispute referred to by the Deputy, it would not be appropriate for me to refer this matter to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" />The responsibility for the resolution of an industrial dispute is ultimately a matter for the parties directly involved. I would urge the parties to address this matter availing themselves, if it would help, of the assistance of the conciliation machinery of the State, which, while not having a formal role, has an excellent record of success in mediating between the parties in disputes.</P>
    <P>I might add, as my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated to the House, that the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which has been incorporated into Irish law as the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967, sets out a framework of privileges and immunities that are intended to facilitate effective diplomacy between states that are parties to the convention. However, the convention also refers to the need to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent analysis of the underlying climate of industrial relations suggests that the main drivers of change for the foreseeable future will include: some uncertainty in the macro economy, competitiveness and adaptability by comparison with the momentum of the past five years; modernisation and re-organisation in the public service with, particularly, restructuring in some public companies stemming from deregulation liberalisation and, in some cases, major investment programmes; labour market and workplace challenges and opportunities presented by factors such as life-long learning, work-life balance and growing workplace diversity; developments in the EU, notably concerning information and consultation of workers; and, regarding pay, the advent of benchmarking in the public service and the expiry of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Some or all of these drivers will shape the response of Government, the industrial relations machinery &ndash; as evidenced, for example, in the recently published Strategy Framework, 2002-2004, of the Labour Relations Commission &ndash;  or bodies such as the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, which has concluded a very comprehensive consultation process in preparation for the launch of its strategic and planning framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Labour Relations Commission envisages adding further to its proactive or developmental efforts, supplementing its effective dispute resolution capacity as well as strengthening the conciliation services. I expect that both it and the National Centre for Partnership and Prosperity will continue to help the parties to move from classic con<Col N="1211" /> frontational stances to a joint problem-solving approach.</P>

I am informed by the Department of Defence that systems and resources are not in place to cost individual flights. Costs are estimated on a direct cost per flying hour basis. The latest direct cost per flying hour is £710, &euro;901.51, as computed on 29 February 2000. On that basis, the total cost of all flights taken by me in the aircraft in question amounts to &euro;8,038.50, £6,330.83.</P>

      <P>The agencies which come within the remit of my Department are engaged in a range of measures to maximise job creation and to secure alternative employment for those affected by company closures in the west Dublin area.</P>
      <P>FÁS, the national training and employment authority, has offered a comprehensive service to employees in the three companies referred to by the Deputy. FÁS has undertaken a 'company-based' response in addressing the employment and training needs of the workers that have been, and will be, made redundant from these companies. The main services provided by FÁS relate to assisting workers in sourcing alternative employment, and identifying and addressing their training needs related to securing this employment.</P>
      <P>Despite the slowdown in foreign inward investment since early in 2001, IDA Ireland has a number of projects under way in west Dublin. These include a pharmaceutical plant in Blanchardstown, where construction is well advanced and production is due to commence in early 2003. Recruitment is under way, with 430 new jobs to be created. Construction of a new bio-pharmaceutical plant in Clondalkin is under way also &ndash; construction will employ 2,500 people over the next three years. The development represents a significant investment by the company in Dublin and will create 1,300 jobs at full production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a major facility is under construction at the National Digital Park, City West Business Campus. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the local authorities, the local chambers of commerce and IDA Ireland in the Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown areas to maximise the level of employment in industry. Enterprise Ireland is working at two levels on this issue. It is endeavouring to grow existing businesses in the area. It is also endeavouring to maximise the number of high potential start-ups in the area, building on the incubation/enterprise centre model and maximising the potential of the Tallaght institute in generating new projects. The <Col N="1213" /> new Blanchardstown Institute of Technology will provide similar opportunities.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited, IICL, is a UK-authorised insurer. Accordingly, responsibility for ensuring that IICL could meet claims from its policy holders lay with the UK authorities who were responsible for the financial supervision of the company.</P>
      <P>The current position is that IICL is in provisional liquidation and the liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law. Companies with claims outstanding against IICL should pursue their cases with the provisional liquidators.</P>
      <P>With regard to Irish policyholders of IICL, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has sought information on a number of matters, including the number and value of claims, breakdown of claims by category and amount of premiums paid to IICL. This information was sought from the provisional liquidators of IICL and from representative bodies in Ireland for the businesses affected. While some information has been received, it is still very incomplete and could not be relied on to give the full picture. Indeed, it appears that it may be extremely difficult to obtain final comprehensive information in view of the timescale that can be involved in claims actually being made and in settlement amounts being arrived at.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties being faced by IICL policyholders. However, it would not be acceptable to burden Irish taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims resulting from the failure of this UK Company.</P>

      <P>Under Section 11 of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, the Competition Authority may study and analyse any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services. I have power under the same section to request the authority to carry out studies.</P>
      <P>Under merger law, I can refer any notified proposal to the authority for investigation. However, each notified case is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>Currently, the authority is undertaking, at my request, a study on the operation of the Casual Trading Act, 1995. In addition, on its own initiative, the authority is currently engaged in a study of the following eight professions: medical practitioner, dentist, veterinary surgeon, optometrist, solicitor, barrister, architect and engineer.</P>
      <P>The authority has just recently completed an investigation, under section 8 of the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, into the proposed takeover by GEHE Ireland Limited of a number of pharmacy chains in the State. I am studying the results of their deliberations.</P>
      <P>I do not have any immediate plans to ask the authority to undertake further studies or investigations.</P>

      <P>The issue of the fall off in the take up of science subjects is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. <Col N="1217" /> The Minister has established a task force to examine all matters impacting on the take up of the physical sciences and related subjects at both second and third level. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is represented on this task force, which is chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare and I understand a final report is expected this month.</P>
      <P>The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the development of a knowledge based economy through the substantial investment of &euro;2.5 billion allocated for research, technological development and innovation in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. If we are to achieve success in this strategy, a crucial element will be the availability of adequate numbers of maths, science and engineering graduates, which will be the key to job creation and job maintenance in the future. This issue was highlighted by the IDA in its submission to the task force. In this context there is a common view that the physical sciences, therefore, must be made more attractive to students. The science, technology and innovation awareness programme managed by Forfás on behalf of the office of science and technology in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment aims to raise the awareness of science, technology and innovation among young people and to highlight their increasingly central role in national and social economic development.</P>
      <P>Forfás, in its recent statement on the review of 2001 and outlook for 2002, indicated that it was essential that the fall off in the study of science subjects at second level is reversed if the people required to undertake research and development in future years are to be available.</P>
      <P>We are confident, therefore, that the task force on the physical sciences will report on the comprehensive measures required to address this issue.</P>

      <Quest> the progress made to date in calibrating taxi meters in the Carriage Office to provide taxi fares in euro; and when all taxi meters will be so converted. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Calibration of taxi meters is undertaken by private installation companies who supply and repair taxi meters for the trade. Calibration is the process whereby meters are programmed or adjusted to measure time and distance accurately and to calculate the fare payable in accordance with fare structures approved by local authorities. In accordance with the Metrology Act, 1996, operators of taxi meters must ensure meters conform to the requirements of the Act. Verification of taxi meters is undertaken by the legal metrology service, LMS, of the National Standards <Col N="1218" /> Authority of Ireland, an agency of my Department, upon request by taxi operators. Verification entails checking the accuracy of meters, including meters converted to the euro currency.</P>
      <P>The conversion of taxi meters to euro by some Dublin based meter installation companies commenced in December 2001. The remainder of the Dublin installers and most of those in the rest of the country commenced the process on 2 January 2002. The software programmes containing the euro fares have been validated by the LMS prior to being installed in individual meters. There is no legal requirement that taxi meters be converted to euro by the end of 2001. However, installation companies are aware of the need to have all taxi meters converted by the end of the dual currency circulation period which will continue until 9 February 2002. All taxi operators have been supplied by Forfás with a special conversion kit comprising currency conversion tables and an electronic converter.</P>
      <P>The verification of taxi meters by the LMS has been under way since mid-December. To date, approximately 22% of meters in Dublin have been verified. There is a waiting list for verification at present extending to end April 2002. The number of metered taxis in Dublin has increased to over 8,000 from 2,700 prior to deregulation. The full resources of the LMS are being applied to this work and a second test centre has been put in operation. After lengthy consultation with staff during 2001, management had sought to introduce a more efficient method of verifying fare changes on meters, but the union representing inspection staff, MSF, has placed the issue in dispute. Conciliation efforts are continuing.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the availability of taxis will not be affected as taxis will continue to operate pending verification of their meters. The situation outside Dublin and Bray, where 30 other local authorities license taxis, is that conversion to euro is taking place in all but six local authority areas where the setting of maximum fares is awaited or under review.</P>

      <P>The local employment service, LES, has a central role in facilitating unemployed people to progress to training or job opportunities or in assisting them in identifying and overcoming barriers to progression. In 2001 almost 8,000 clients benefited from the LES nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" />Since mid-2000 the management of the LES has been assigned to FÁS as part of a new dual-stranded national employment service and a new employment services advisory committee to the FÁS executive was established to carry forward this process. The role of the ESAC is to advise the executive of FÁS on all aspects of the operation of the national employment service in the context of national employment policy; to monitor and make recommendations on the operation and effectiveness of the NES, including the LES and FÁS; to develop inputs into national policy for the national employment service; and to assist in the formation of principles guiding the respective roles and development and complementarity of both strands of the national employment service.</P>
    <P>In the overall context of the FÁS strategic review of policy, and the key role filled by the new dual-stranded national employment service in meeting labour market policies and objectives, I have requested the FÁS board to undertake a review of the activities and resources of the national employment service to ensure that it is fully and properly equipped to carry out its essential tasks. This review will be carried out under the aegis of the employment service advisory committee on which my Department is represented at senior level.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the proposed review of the national employment service will, among other matters, give consideration to a number of issues which have been highlighted in the recent report of the National Economic and Social Forum concerning the future operation of the LES.</P>

      <P>The potential dangers posed to persons from exposure to asbestos fibres is well recognised and it is essential that workers are protected against the risk of such a situation arising at their place of work. Existing European Union-derived regulations currently govern the protection of workers exposed to asbestos.</P>
      <P>Ireland is currently involved at European level in the development of a new asbestos directive. The proposed directive will provide for more specific and enhanced requirements to ensure the protection of high-risk workers against asbestos fibres exposure. In addition, the proposed directive will further reduce the existing exposure limits so as to enhance the protection of all workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my capacity as the Government's representative at the Council of Ministers for the Employ<Col N="1220" /> ment and Social Policy Council, last autumn I strongly supported the Belgian Presidency presentation on the proposal for the new directive and I confirmed the need to develop and modernise the existing legislation in the light of changes within the asbestos industry in Ireland and at European level in general. The Government strongly supports and welcomes the proposed new directive which will further assist in the protection of all, particularly those most at risk from exposure to asbestos fibres while performing their work activities.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State agency, under the auspices of my Department, responsible for the health and safety of workers. The authority is currently participating in the ongoing working group meetings at European level on the proposed directive on asbestos.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The labour market has changed dramatically in Ireland in recent years. Since 1997 employment has grown by 28% and unemployment has fallen to 4.3% from 10% in 1997. Long-term unemployment is currently recorded at 1.2%. This represents a tight labour market characterised by vacancies in all sectors and at all skill levels.</P>
      <P>The recent rise in unemployment has been brought about mainly by short-term factors such as the downturn in the technological sector and the economic effects of the 11 September attack in the US. There is a general view that unemployment will rise in 2002 but that good economic and employment growth will return in the medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of relatively low unemployment, a tight labour market over the foreseeable future and the need for continuous upskilling of those in the workforce, I believe that the future strategy of FÁS should be based on a new emphasis on services to employers to maintain skills and competitiveness; more training for job seekers and people in work to ensure that they remain employable in the face of change; greater mobilisation of labour and skills, particularly from at home, to meet the needs of a developing economy; and continuing to improve outcomes for unemployed people and marginalised people, <Col N="1223" /> including early intervention to counteract the risk of long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>In response to the changed labour market conditions and taking account of the foregoing concerns, FÁS engaged in a strategic review and published its new strategy in December last. The key elements of the new strategy are a significant emphasis on services to employers and employed people; a greater focus on mobility and flexibility, through the upskilling of the workforce; further development of the standard-based apprenticeship programme, including further educational/training options for craft persons; the provision of portable skills for employees; the promotion of employment through greater mobilisation of labour supply from all available sources; more assistance to help people to move from unemployment into employment; continuing to improve services for unemployed people, particularly those who are marginalised with an emphasis on a focused approach, tailored to individual needs; using the employment service as a gateway to all labour market services; and a guarantee of service to unemployed people.</P>
    <P>This shift in focus will be supported by an increased commitment to quality and standards in all FÁS activities; a regular review of FÁS services and programmes to assess their continued relevance in a rapidly-changing environment and to identify changes that may be required; putting in place a best practice human resources strategy and the necessary organisational structures and systems to ensure the flexibility to implement change rapidly, efficiently and effectively; and openness to alternative delivery systems and the building of working partnerships and alliances with other service providers.</P>
    <P>FÁS has, and will continue to play, a major role in meeting the labour and skills requirements of the economy and in tackling unemployment. The FÁS budget remains significant. In 2002 its total operating budget is over &euro;870 million and it has the capacity to engage with up to 100,000 people on training or employment programmes.</P>

      <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, was completed in 1998. The report on this has been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Some 11 investigations were initiated by me under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. Four of these have been concluded. Of the four investigations completed, two of the reports were passed to the DPP. The file in one case was returned and a number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors.</P>
      <P>Five investigations under section 19 are ongoing. Reports in respect of two of these five investigations are at a very advanced stage of completion with the remaining three reports expected to be completed during the course of 2002. Two investigations were held up in legal appeals; certain legal matters are still outstanding. It is a matter for the Director of Corporate Enforcement to decide how to proceed on this investigation.</P>
      <P>One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989. This report has been completed and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as to the inspectors undertaking the section investigation into that company.</P>
      <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to &euro;8.25 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations. Similarly, the major proportion of the legal costs relating to the investigations is being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Most of this &euro;8.25 million derives from the costs to date of the High Court inspectors appointed under section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" />The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors have completed their investigations. Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001.</P>

      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment monitors the rate of insurance premium increases. In accordance with EU law, we cannot require insurance companies to notify us of premium rates. Accordingly, the Department does not have authoritative statistics on premiums.</P>
      <P>However, research conducted for the Department has shown that insurance premiums are high in Ireland compared to other EU countries, including the UK. The Deloitte and Touche report of 1996 found this to be the case but pointed to differences in compensation systems and to high transaction costs of claims in Ireland, particularly both legal costs and the cost of expert witnesses.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>

      <P>The numbers of redundancies notified to my Department in 2000 and 2001 were 13,316 and 19,828 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards anticipated job losses, one indicator of this is the number of collective redundancies notified to my Department under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977. These are the numbers of employees that companies have indicated that they propose to make redundant after the statutory minimum notification period of 30 days. A total of approximately 11,700 collective redun<Col N="1226" /> dancies were notified in the six months July to December 2001.</P>
    <P>The increase in the level of job losses here in recent months is a consequence of the downturn, over the past year or so, in the US and global economies and the slump in the ICT sector in particular. The tragic events of 11 September exacerbated the situation, with a particular impact on sectors such as aerospace and tourism.</P>
    <P>While the prospects for an improvement in 2002 are very much dependent on the speed and strength of recovery in the US economy, and in the ICT sector in particular, the Government, together with the State industrial development agencies, are continuing to aggressively address the factors which impact on competitiveness and on our ability to create quality jobs in the economy.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is working closely with existing overseas companies here with a view to helping them move up the value chain into higher value products and services and into higher order functions such as research and development. Simultaneously, IDA Ireland is pursuing high quality new investment that is in keeping with the competitive characteristics of the economy today.</P>
    <P>For our indigenous companies, market conditions in the short-term are likely to remain challenging, especially for companies in the high technology sectors. Enterprise Ireland's work with companies is focused on areas such as increasing innovation and competitiveness through investment in research and development and increasing and diversifying exports.</P>
    <P>I remain confident that by pursuing such issues and promoting developments in the wider economy, such as infrastructure and skills, we will be well positioned to take full advantage of the upturn in global economic conditions.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a number of surveys undertaken recently which have compared prices charged for various products in Ireland to the prices charged for the same products in other EU member states. They showed that Irish consumers pay higher prices in some cases and lower prices in others. I am also aware that there have been some complaints that not all of the comparisons were valid and, accordingly, that the surveys were flawed in some respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome these surveys as I believe that one of the great advantages of the euro is that it facili<Col N="1227" /> tates this type of price comparison and should, in time, lead to a convergence of pricing across the euro zone to the benefit of consumers. However, it is important that we have comprehensive and reliable information on which to base judgments about the reasonableness of the pricing of goods and services in Ireland as compared to other euro zone states. For this reason, I have asked Forfás to undertake a comprehensive and rigorous study of this matter and I look forward to its report in due course.</P>

      <P>FÁS has a comprehensive approach and support system for workers who are threatened with, or affected by, redundancy. The support provided typically involves engaging rapidly in intensive interviews with workers to provide information on the supports and services available from FÁS to the individuals concerned. Redundant workers then are referred to available jobs, training courses or other appropriate options.</P>
      <P>Where necessary, FÁS will establish special or customised training courses for workers to address their upskilling needs, either through its direct provision or through external training providers. Flexible approaches may include evening and Saturday courses, e-learning options and customised training. FÁS is also developing broader personal supports to people affected by the trauma of redundancy, including advice on personal and financial matters.</P>
      <P>In addition to the services offered directly by FÁS to redundant workers or those threatened by redundancy, the implementation of a strategic framework for lifelong learning will be essential to ensure that workers develop a portfolio of transferable skills which will provide them with the capacity to move between jobs in response to economic and technological change. I understand that key elements of the framework being considered in the context of the draft report of the taskforce on lifelong learning include the development and implementation of a national framework of qualifications; development of basic skills especially literacy, numeracy and IT skills; improved information and guidance; and specific measures to address training in the workplace.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many firms are facing and of the problems this is creating for them.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks that they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the effects of the 11 Sep<Col N="1231" /> tember attacks in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, which had a significant presence in the Irish market for the past seven years.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board.

The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and, to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The group is developing proposals at present designed to bring the initiative to small and medium sized firms.</P>
    <P>I would encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of reducing the worst effects of the current circumstances, for example by better management of risks, examination of excess covers and whether the full extent of the covers included in policies is actually required by each individual company.</P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited is a UK authorised insurer. Accordingly, responsibility for ensuring that IICL could meet claims from its policyholders lay with the UK authorities that were responsible for the financial supervision of the company.</P>
      <P>IICL is in provisional liquidation and that process must be dealt with under UK law. Companies with claims outstanding against IICL should pursue their cases with the provisional liquidators. Clarification obtained from the UK authorities indicates that private policyholders are, in principle, protected under the UK Policyholder Protection Act, subject to the policyholders meeting all of the other requirements of the UK Act, while Irish commercial policyholders are unlikely to be covered under that Act.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties being faced by IICL policyholders. However, it would not be acceptable to burden Irish taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims, resulting from the failure of this UK company.</P>

      <P>The new procedures relating to recruitment of personnel from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, were introduced in light of recent changes in the economic climate in Ireland, notably the increase in the level of unemployment. They are designed to verify that employers are making all reasonable efforts to recruit locally or through the wider EEA market before looking to employ non-EEA nationals, by obliging employers to register job vacancies with FÁS before making a work permit application.</P>
      <P>Renewals of permits in respect of existing employees by existing employers will be readily facilitated and such employees are not in any way threatened. The new arrangements do not apply to recruitment of medical professionals because of the obvious shortages of skilled personnel in that sector.</P>
      <P>I am aware of representations made by various employer groups, including IBEC, regarding the new arrangements which came into effect as recently as 2 January. As job vacancies can take some four to six weeks to process through FÁS, it is too early yet to tell how effective the new system is in sourcing Irish-EEA staff. The implementation and effectiveness of the new arrangements will be monitored closely. I am not aware of any concerns expressed by trades unions regarding the introduction of the new procedures.</P>
      <P>While non-EEA personnel are recruited to fill specific vacancies by specific employers, they have the same rights as Irish employees and my Department has in practice, on a case by case basis, facilitated changes of employer subject to the issue of a new work permit. However, I would not favour any arrangement whereby large numbers of relatively unskilled personnel are simply coming to Ireland in search of work without any guarantee of finding it.</P>

      <P>We are aware of the difficulties being experienced by some businesses in obtaining public liability and employer's liability insurance cover at present.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on the provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims in Ireland, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the effects of the 11 September attacks in the United States of America.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to establish a personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, with a view to reducing the costs of the delivery of compensation in personal injuries cases. Work on the establishment of the PIAB is in progress. It is expected that the PIAB will, in the course of time, substantially reduce the number of personal injury claims being brought to court, thus reducing the legal and other costs involved in the delivery of personal injury compensation.</P>

The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, which had a significant presence in the Irish market for the past seven years.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board. I am confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>
    <P>A workplace safety group has been established with a view to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The group is developing proposals at present designed to bring the initiative to small and medium sized firms.</P>
    <P>I would encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of reducing the worst effects of the current circumstances, for example by better management of risks, examination of excess covers and whether the full extent of the covers included in policies is actually required by all individual businesses.</P>

      <P>The increases in the price of electricity announced in October 2001 were approved by the Commission for Electricity Regulation, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>In determining the appropriate tariffs the CER examined the charges and the costs underlying the charges for electricity supplied by the ESB. The likely effect of such increases on Irish companies would have been one of the factors taken into account by the commission in reaching its decision.</P>
      <P>The result of the commission's review is an 8.6% increase in the average price of electricity. The percentage increases for the different categories of business customers are as follows: 3% for small businesses; 13% for medium sized businesses; and 14% for large businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, eligible customers can choose to have their electricity supplied to them by the ESB in its capacity as public electricity supplier or by one of the licensed independent electricity sup<Col N="1237" /> pliers. With effect from February 2002, electricity market opening will increase to 40% and approximately 1,600 customers, whose annual consumption is at least 1 gigawatt per hour, will be free to choose their electricity supplier. The market will move to full liberalisation in February 2005. The independent power producers will provide eligible customers with the opportunity to negotiate improved prices and, when new efficient power plants are constructed such customers will have the opportunity to source even more competitively priced electricity in the open market.</P>
    <P>Aside from increases totalling 3.5% in 1996/97, Irish electricity charges have not increased in the past 15 years. In comparison, the consumer price index has increased by 51% during the same period resulting in a reduction of over 50% in real electricity prices over the same period.</P>
    <P>Ireland currently has a shortage of electricity generation capacity and there is an urgent need for investment in transmission and distribution capacity. The price of electricity must reflect the economic cost of production and distribution. If prices were maintained at their current non-cost reflective levels, then, as happened in California, new generators would not enter the market, resulting in serious capacity concerns.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the underwriting of insurance risks and the setting of premiums are matters for judgment by individual private insurance companies and EU law prevents my Department from intervening directly in the matter. For example, motor insurance premiums are normally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, for particular risks and classes of risk.</P>
      <P>My Department is pursuing initiatives to address the high cost of insurance, including motor insurance. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board has been charged with advising us on motor insurance costs and, in particular, with examining the relationship between the incidence of claims and the premiums charged for various classes of policy holder identified by age and sex. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. I expect to receive the final report of the board over the month ahead. In light of its recommendations, the Government and I will consider what further action is appropriate and necessary.</P>

      <P>I have no direct input to decisions regarding the grant aiding of individual companies as it is an operational matter for the development agencies. However, I understand from Enterprise Ireland that Universal Dehydrates &ndash; now known as Sensient Technologies Corporation &ndash; has been paid no grant assistance since acquiring the company from the Campbell Soup Company in 1994. Under Campbell's ownership, from 1988 to 1994, the company had been paid a total of &euro;381,664 in grant assistance, comprising &euro;236,835 as research and development assistance and &euro;144,829 as training assistance. In the 22 year period prior to 1988 the company was owned by three companies &ndash; Irish Sugar Company from 1966 to 1986, Premier Vegetables from 1986 to 1987 and Freshbake Limited from 1987 to 1988 &ndash; and received a total of &euro;584,555 in grant assistance during that period. Therefore, the company has received a total of &euro;966,219 in grant assistance since its inception in 1966.</P>
      <P>There have been no repayments to Enterprise Ireland because any contingent liability on the outstanding grants had expired at the time of cessation of the main activity. The company is still operating an advanced freeze-drying facility on the site and there is one grant &ndash; amounting to &euro;33,195 &ndash; still with contingent liability in respect of this. This liability is due to cease on 30 March 2002. Should the company cease the undertaking and dispose of the building before this date, it will be liable for this amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" />I understand from Enterprise Ireland that the main site and premises have been sold to a private developer. The company is in negotiations with another party for the potential sale of the site and premises containing the advanced freeze-drying facility, approximately four acres.</P>
    <P>Neither Enterprise Ireland nor IDA Ireland is aware of any application for grant aid for industrial development in relation to this facility.</P>

      <P>Persons previously in receipt of the carers allowance have direct access to community employment. Provision was made under the Social Welfare Act, 1999 to allow carers undertake employment for up to ten hours per week while retaining this allowance. The legislation does not allow for discretion in this matter but strictly provides for work of ten hours or less a week only. As CE participants work an average of 19.5 hours per week, such employment is outside the scope of this provision and carer's allowance is not payable.</P>

      <P>As given the earnings disregards associated with OPFP, recipients can earn up to &euro;146.50 and still qualify for a full rate of OPFP. Those who earn between &euro;146.50 and &euro;293.00 may still qualify for a reduced payment.

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited, IICL, is a UK authorised insurer. Accordingly, responsibility for ensuring that IICL could meet claims from its policy holders lay with the UK authorities who were responsible for the financial supervision of the company. The current position is that IICL is in provisional liquidation and the liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law. Companies, including hotels, with claims outstanding against IICL should pursue their cases with the provisional liquidators.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties being faced by IICL policy holders. However, it would not be acceptable to burden Irish taxpayers with the inevitable cost that would be involved in meeting insurance claims, resulting from the failure of this UK company.</P>

      <P>Since the transposition into Irish Law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directives in 1994, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries. In addition, the removal of the cap on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Government to establish a personal injuries assessment board seeks to address the issue of the high cost of settling claims by achieving a reduction in the delivery cost of personal injury compensation. This should make the marketplace more attractive and encourage more entrants.</P>

    <P>With regard to motor insurance, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, is in the process of completing its work. I expect to receive the final report over the next month. We will examine the board's recommendations as a matter of urgency when received with the intention of bringing proposals to Government thereafter. <Col N="1242" /> Making accurate comparisons between motor insurance costs in Ireland and other European countries is difficult due to a number of factors such as type of insurance cover, age groups, types of vehicles and even regional differences within countries. There are also differences in how compensation for injuries is paid in these countries. In the final analysis however, the pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual companies and EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to either.</P>

      <P>Making accurate comparisons between motor insurance costs in Ireland and other European countries is difficult due to a number of factors such as type of insurance cover, age groups, types of vehicles and even regional differences within countries. There are also differences in how compensation for motor injuries is paid in countries such as France, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, who provide compensation benefits, almost exclusively, through the medium of social security benefits with a high level of earnings-related income support. Ireland, on the other hand, effectively operates two parallel systems of compensation provision, that is, a social security scheme of occupational injury benefits, paid on a flat-rate basis with increases for qualified dependants, while allowing unrestricted access to tort liability claims for compensation for loss of earnings and pain and suffering. The following table compares the average motor premium per vehicle in a number of European countries in 1997.</P>

    <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche management consultants, were commissioned in 1996 to undertake a study on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland. Comparisons with other jurisdictions were made in respect of motor insurance. This study found that premium rates in Ireland were higher than in other EU countries surveyed. However, it was pointed out in the report that the continental countries differ so much in the areas <Col N="1243" /> of methods of compensation and levels of awards from Ireland and the United Kingdom that it is difficult to make meaningful and accurately sustainable comparisons.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 135 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>The waiting list or backlog of work permit applications awaiting decision has increased from 1,900 on 1 January 2001 to 6,953 applications last December and is directly related to the increase in the number of applications being received. The backlog on 31 January 2002 stood at 5,529 applications.</P>
      <P>The number of work permit applications increased from an average of over 350 per week in 2000 to over 825 per week last year. The level of applications climbed during the year and in December alone, an unprecedented 5,690 applications were received. New procedures were introduced with effect from 2 January 2002 and this has resulted, at least temporarily, in a reduction in the number of applications received. The average number of complete and valid applications for January 2002 was 325 applications per week.</P>
      <P>While the staff of the section was increased by 50% last year in an effort to reduce processing time, the very large increase in applications meant that the waiting period could not be reduced. Nevertheless, the staff in the section issued 36,436 permits in 2001, compared with some 18,000 in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The number of work permit applications refused for each of the past 12 months is as follows:&ndash;</P>

      <P>As a highly globalised, open economy, it is clear that Ireland is not immune from developments in the international economic environment. Although we expect that total exports for 2001 will be higher than in 2000 &ndash; exports rose by 14% in the period January to November 2001, the latest period for which statistics are available, over the same period in 2000 &ndash; it is clear that the rate of growth has slowed substantially in the later part of the year.</P>
      <P>Conscious of the ongoing need to assist Irish companies to develop markets abroad, I and the Ministers of State in my Department undertook 12 overseas promotional visits last year. These trips included trade missions with large numbers of participants and smaller events with a specific sectoral focus. Our intention is to continue this activity this year where there is a demand from the business sector.</P>
      <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland has undertaken to increase the tempo of its promotional activities over the coming year. Its activities will include becoming more proactive in finding and introducing international buyers to clients. In line with stated client needs, a stretch target has been set to maximise the number and quality of buyer-client interactions. This will be done by expanding the outward mission programme to emerging markets, for example, in India and Asia; working intensely on a one-to-one basis with a number of existing exporters to the EU with a view to increasing their market coverage and share; hosting events in key markets for clients to meet new buyers; and increasing the number of key buyers visiting clients in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland's activities will also include improving the international marketing knowledge and capability of indigenous companies through the introduction of internationally based market experts to clients in Ireland through seminars and other group training initiatives; and continuing to undertake specialist market research for both sectors and individual clients. Its activities will further include continuing to increase the number of incubation centres-occupancy rates in key overseas markets, for example, in early 2001 we had two centres with ten units and in early 2002 we have 11 centres with 36 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that these actions, combined with the strength and competitiveness of Irish exporters, will help to maintain our position in <Col N="1245" /> world markets, and that our companies will be able to take advantage of the upturn in the global economy which is expected this year to return to the strong rates of growth in export earnings which we have seen over the past number of years.</P>

The process typically involves the following components: top-level agreement with the company and other organisations on responsibilities and actions; intensive interviews, individually and-or in groups, with affected workers to outline the range of supports and services available; preparation of a skills analysis report by FÁS based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities; referral by FÁS of redundant workers to jobs, training courses or other options; establishment by FÁS of special or customised training courses where necessary; and ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</P>
      <P>The essence of FÁS support is provided through the model set out above. However, within the available budget, FÁS continues to develop its services through, for example, efforts to increase the flexibility and customisation of training. This can include buying training from other providers including, potentially, companies themselves. FÁS is also developing broader opportunities for personal support to persons having to cope with the trauma of redundancy.</P>

      <P>My Department and its agencies are continuously monitoring the position of firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors to identify opportunities and threats to employment. There is no evidence available to suggest any increasing tendency for firms to relocate to lower wage economies. The reasons for such relocation are many, varied and complex, and on balance Ireland continues to benefit from such movement due to the underlying strength of our economy despite the recent world downturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality and sustainability of the jobs we create is a particular focus for the future. In order to maximise the potential of our existing base of <Col N="1247" /> overseas companies and to minimise job losses, IDA Ireland is encouraging them to add strategic functions including research and development, technical support, software development, e-commerce, logistics, and shared services. In this way, such firms can move up the value chain and become more embedded in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>To further facilitate enterprise development, the Government is focusing on enhancing the country's skills base, implementing the infrastructure elements of the national development plan and shaping the regulatory environment for enterprise.</P>

      <P>The group is examining the legal implications, including what legislative changes, if any, will be necessary to establish the PIAB. The work also includes consideration of structures and operational procedures for the board. Reaching final agreement is proving more difficult than previously envisaged. The group is however, nearing completion of its examination and is finalising its report. I will consider the report of the group as a matter of urgency, and will bring proposals to Government thereafter.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation for work related injuries, in its initial term of operation, and later in motor injury cases by reducing the delivery costs of compensation.</P>

      <P>At present there is in place a comprehensive set of conservation measures in relation to the exploitation of salmon by the commercial fishing and recreational angling sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commercial fishing for salmon is permitted only within six nautical miles of the baseline and within the set season for each type of fishing engine. Within the season there are restrictions relating to the days and times of fishing operations and in relation to the types of fishing gear which may be used. Furthermore, the number of licences which may be issued by the regional fish<Col N="1249" /> eries boards for the various types of fishing engines is limited by the provisions of the control of fishing for salmon orders.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recreational angling sector, I have introduced the following measures on the recommendation of the National Salmon Commission: wild salmon tagging scheme which commenced in January 2001; bag limit of one salmon per angler per day from the beginning of January to the end of May; and prohibition on the sale of salmon caught by rod and line. In addition to the above regulatory measures, the fisheries boards also apply a range of conservation measures in relation to fisheries which are under their management.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced the introduction of quotas for the taking of salmon by commercial fishing engines commencing this year. The detailed practical arrangements are being finalised at present. In parallel with the introduction of quotas for the commercial fishery, I have requested the National Salmon Commission to recommend on bag limits for the totality of the 2002 angling season and any other enhanced conservation measures which it considers appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy to note that the long overdue dredging of Galway Harbour was satisfactorily completed. The essential condition of the dumping at sea permit granted to Galway Harbour Company, namely, no dredging of material in the starboard side of the commercial dock, was fully complied with. The Marine Institute has confirmed, from a survey of the dumpsite where all dredged material was dumped, that no material from that exclusion zone was found there. As already indicated, the minor variations in other permit conditions necessitated by bad weather, tidal conditions, engineering constraints and in the interests of <Col N="1250" /> safety, had no adverse environmental consequences.</P>

      <P>At the December Fisheries Council I secured agreement to a national whiting quota of 8,814 tonnes in the Celtic Sea for 2002. This represents a 51% increase over 2001 and delivers enhanced fishing possibilities for Irish fishermen this year.</P>
      <P>My Department liases regularly with the Irish fishing industry in relation on the management of available quotas. The aim is to ensure the best possible spread in terms of take-up of quota during the year, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions. The key objective is to avoid early closure of fisheries through premature exhaustion of quota.</P>
      <P>My Department held discussions with the industry last month on the management options for the various fisheries, including the Celtic Sea whiting fishery. The Department proposed that the fishery should be the subject of a specific management regime in order to minimise the potential for market over-supply of whiting, and resulting poor prices, in the early months of the year. I have recently decided to implement for the month of February a 21 tonne catch limitation for seiners and a 15 tonnes catch limitation for trawlers, replacing the 12 and six tonne catch limitations which were in place for January. The regime in place for February represents a prudent balance between catching opportunities for the supply side and market trends on the demand side. The fishery and market conditions will be kept under close review in consultation with the industry and subsequent management regimes will continue to have full regard for all the relevant factors.</P>

    <P>In October 2001, my Department wrote to all coastal local authorities requesting proposals, in order of priority, for consideration in the context of the 2002 coastal protection programme. Wexford County Council has submitted ten proposals for coastal protection works in the county. The question of funding coastal protection works in County Wexford in 2002 is being considered in the context of the funding available for such works and overall national priorities.</P>

      <P>Following detailed consideration of the options available to regularise the situation of a number of traditional inshore fishermen, I have introduced a new licensing and registration scheme for the sector. The national scheme will be operated within the current MGP framework and we are not, therefore, seeking any specific adjustment to MGP targets from the Commission. The scheme applies to inshore fishermen who are owners of small boats, under 12 metres in overall length, and who for various reasons have not previously applied for registry. Applicants will have the option, if they choose, of availing of up to two years to buy their 100% replacement capacity on a phased basis. Fishermen applying under the scheme will be required to prove ownership, a track record in fishing and meet safety standards. The closing date for the scheme is 28 March 2002. Application forms under the scheme are available from my Department and from Bord Iascaigh Mhara. The EU Commission will be advised of the outcome of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be referring to a memorandum forwarded by President Bush to Secretary of State Powell on 7 December 2001 concerning the lifting of the US congressional ban on training and <Col N="1254" /> exchange programmes run by the FBI for the RUC.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the US Congress halted funding for training and-or exchange programmes conducted by the FBI for the RUC, or any successor organisations, until such time as the US President issued a report on FBI-RUC training for the years 1994-99 and could also certify that: such training programmes are necessary to improve the professionalism of policing in Northern Ireland and to advance the peace process; such programmes include a significant human rights component in the curriculum; vetting procedures have been established in the Departments of State and Justice, and any other appropriate federal agency, to ensure that training or exchange programmes do not include individual RUC members suspected of human rights violations, including any role in the murder of Patrick Finucane or Rosemary Nelson or other violence or serious threat of violence against defence attorneys in Northern Ireland; and the British and Irish Governments are committed to assisting in the full implementation of the recommendations of the Patten Report.</P>
      <P>In his memorandum of 7 December 2001, President Bush provided the necessary certification under all these headings, thereby allowing training and-or exchange programmes to take place between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the FBI. The memorandum also set out in detail how these conditions were being met, including the vetting procedure put in place to ensure that no officers who may have been involved in human rights violations, including the murders of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson, would be allowed participate in FBI sponsored training and exchange programmes.</P>
      <P>This vetting will be handled through the FBI's international relations branch. In addition to standard vetting procedures, PSNI nominees must have a written assurance provided by the Chief Constable that there are not substantial grounds for believing that the nominees have committed or condoned violations of internationally recognised human rights, including any role in the murders of Pat Finucane or Rosemary Nelson.</P>
      <P>The President's decision to provide such certification was an acknowledgement that considerable advances have been made in implementing the recommendations of the Patten Report. At the time, I welcomed President Bush's decision and noted that it was fully in accordance with the Government's endorsement of the new policing arrangements which were agreed at Weston Park. It is our view that the provision of international training can help to further transform policing in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Competitiveness is a key priority for the Government. Maintaining and improving our competitiveness is the basis on which we can remain a successful economy into the future. There are many factors that influence competitiveness and one of these is business input costs. Among these costs is the cost of Internet access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analysis of dial-up Internet access prices is contained in the EU Commission's recently published Seventh Report on the Implementation of the Telecommunications Regulatory Package in Member States (COM 2001 706 final, 26 November 2001). The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has taken several steps to support dial-up Internet access and in <Col N="1256" /> particular it has opened two new non-geographic codes for use in accessing internet service providers, ISPs.</P>
    <P>Government policy is to facilitate the roll-out of state of the art infrastructures and to provide the legislative and regulatory environment which will serve to make a major contribution to sustained macro-economic growth and the realisation of competitively priced, high quality services.</P>
    <P>Government proposals on regulatory reform of the communications sector are designed to ensure that the regulatory conditions in Ireland are effective in stimulating a competitive market for communications services, including Internet services. In this regard the draft Communications (Regulation) Bill will enhance the regulatory framework so as to further facilitate the development of the sector while ensuring that appropriate elements of the public interest are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Bill is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is my intention to have the Bill published in the next few weeks and, time permitting, to have it enacted before the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>Also, low cost high speed Internet access is seen as a key element of the Government's communication policy. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, &euro;200 million of public funds have been earmarked to leverage investment in advance communications infrastructure and services. The focus of this investment will be to support investment in communications and electronic commerce infrastructure, systems and services in less developed areas.</P>

      <P>Under European air transport liberalisation measures, any air carrier licensed in the European Economic Area, that is, the 15 member states of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland, may introduce air services on any route within the EEA without any government or EU controls, subject only to the availability of airport slots at either end of the route and overall safety considerations. As a result the provision of air services on any route is essentially a matter for the commercial judgment of the individual airline.</P>
      <P>A new airline, SkyNet Airlines, will be operating a new service between Shannon and Dublin, commencing later this year. This service will link with other airlines to provide onward connections from Dublin as well as an onwards service to Warsaw.</P>

This radical reform of railway safety legislation will require all railway undertakings, including Iarnród Éireann, to implement a formal safety management system and to describe that system in a document called a safety case. The Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case, all hazards and risks to its railway, including any threat from coastal erosion, and will require that undertaking to put in place measures to reduce those risks to an acceptable level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recently published annual report and accounts of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, for the year 2000. Copies have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The environmental monitoring chapter of the RPII report includes a section on radioactive contamination of the Irish marine environment. In the report, the RPII points out that in 2000 the highest level of technetium-99 concentrations in seaweed was 988 becquerels per kilogram, Bq/kg, wet, compared with 850 Bq/kg, wet, in 1999. The 2000 values, according to the RPII, are lower than the level of 1,675 Bq/kg, wet, recorded in 1998. The report also points out that the technetium-99 activities in seaweed from the south and west coasts were some 150 times lower than in seaweed from the north east coast. However, the level of technetium-99 in fish and shellfish continues to be very low and the RPII advises that from a radiological perspective it is safe to eat seafood landed at Irish fishing ports and to enjoy the amenities of the Irish maritime area. Technetium is one of several radioactive contaminants in the Irish Sea originating from Sellafield. Also, since the measurements referred to are in the sea, the question of per county data does not arise.</P>
      <P>The Government views any contamination of the Irish marine environment arising from discharges of radioactive materials from the Sellafield plant as totally unacceptable and highly objectionable and has repeatedly called on the UK to cease such discharges. The Deputy will be aware that these concerns have prompted the Government to commence significant legal action under the OSPAR Convention and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and, if and as appropriate, EU law.</P>

      <P>The number of post office closures in each of the past five years is as follows: 1997 &ndash; 14; 1998 &ndash; 17; 1999 &ndash; 10; 2000 &ndash; 34; and 2001 &ndash; 62. The locations are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The current policy is that there should be no post office closures. However, vacancies within the network arise as a result of illness, death or retirement. In such cases, An Post advertises the post at least twice and actively canvasses for suitable persons to fill the vacant positions. It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants that a post office is closed. Such closures are regarded as temporary pending an application from a suitable person.</P>

In the case of County Donegal a joint application had been submitted on behalf of a number of community groups in respect of proposals from different parts of the county. The outcome of the ADM assessment process is that the proposals submitted by Páirtíocht Ghaeltacht Thír Chonaill Teo (Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta) and South West Donegal Communities Ltd., were selected for funding. Regrettably, the other organisations mentioned by the Deputy were not successful.</P>

      <P>Dublin Civil Defence on behalf of Dublin City Council has been in occupation of the property on the Esplanade, Wolfe Tone Quay, Dublin 7, since January 1995. The city council currently holds the property under a year to year licence agreement dated 3 February 2000 between the Minister for Defence and Dublin City Council for use as temporary accommodation. Under the terms of the licence either side can terminate the agreement by giving three months written notice.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works, on behalf of the Minister for Finance in whom the property is vested, have indicated that the site occupied by Dublin Civil Defence under the licence agreement is intended for development by the National Museum to extend their vehicle parking facilities. The commissioners have requested vacant possession of the property by the end of June 2002 in order to proceed with this development.</P>
      <P>The Department understands that Dublin Civil Defence has been looking at sites within the Dublin area that might be suitable for use as a headquarters but to date no suitable location has been identified. While the question of alternative accommodation is a matter for Dublin City Council, the Department will endeavour to assist it in that regard by requesting the Commissioners of Public Works to bear the needs of Dublin Civil Defence in mind before the development of the Esplanade property proceeds.</P>
      <P>With regard to Ratra House, Phoenix Park, the current headquarters of the Civil Defence branch of this Department and which is also vested in the Minister for Finance, it has already been decided that, following the decentralisation of the branch to Roscrea, the property will be taken over by the Office of the President for its Gaisce awards scheme.</P>

    <P>The person named was paid his full entitlement of &euro;3,938.64, £3,101.93, under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme on 25 September 2001 in respect of 40.20 hectares of more severely handicapped land at &euro;88.88, £70, per hec<Col N="1267" /> tare and 4.80 hectares of less severely handicapped land at &euro;76.18, £60, per hectare, up to the overall limit of 45 hectares. The addition of the new plot did not result in any increase in payment. The grant of &euro;3,938.64, £3,101.93, compares with his average payment of &euro;2,594.58, £2,043.40, under the old animal-based headage schemes in the three years 1998, 1999 and 2000.</P>
    <P>The person named applied for special beef premium on 11 May 2001 and 31 October 2001 in respect of 45 animals. Payment will issue to the person named when the area aid details have been finalised. The person named will receive advance payment of slaughter premium in respect of 15 animals slaughtered during the period January to September 2001, during February.</P>
    <P>The person named applied for premium for 22 cows under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of his application a query arose regarding animal tag number NPXD0022D. This animal was not on the herdowner's herd reconciliation profile and there was no record on the CMMS of any movement onto his holding. Another animal tag number 291146450064 required further investigation regarding its breed. These matters have now been resolved and the application is being processed for payment and if found in order the full entitlement will be paid provided his area aid details are finalised.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain-type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain-type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain-type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain-type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system, regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough review of the area based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land.

      <P>Projects eligible for aid include,<i> inter alia</i>, the development of angling, equestrian, visitor farms, cycling-walking routes and health farms as well as the upgrading and provision of visitor accommodation, including the restoration of farm buildings as self-catering accommodation. Resources will also be directed towards the cost of marketing and promotion, including the preparation of websites, advertising and attendance at tourism workshops.</P>
      <P>In the delivery of an effective rural-agri-tourism programme in rural areas, my Department continues to work closely with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Bord Fáilte, the regional tourism authorities and Shannon Development to ensure that the limited resources are focused to increase the attractiveness of rural areas for visitors away from the main tourist centres. My Department will shortly establish a rural-agri-tourism strategy group which will include representatives of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, tourism interests, Leader and representatives of the social partners. The group's remit will embrace all aspects of rural-agri-tourism in seeking to increase income earning opportunities for families in rural areas by encouraging more visitors.</P>

Although there is some damage to the external roof slates, the asbestos is generally in good condition and poses no health risk unless disturbed. Agreement has been reached with the school authorities to have the material removed during the summer holidays in 2002 while the school is closed.</P>

      <P>The due date for payment of preliminary tax in respect of the &ldquo;short&rdquo; tax year, 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001, was 31 October 2001. The tax return in relation to that tax year, together with the balance of any tax due, must be submitted not later than 31 October 2002. Any taxpayer who paid insufficient preliminary tax on 31 October 2001 should arrange to pay the outstanding tax liability for this tax year as early as possible in order to minimise possible interest charges.</P>
      <P>While the due date for any balance of tax payable will be earlier than heretofore, this is balanced by the smaller payment required in respect of the short tax year and by the fact that preliminary tax is now payable close to the end of the tax year, rather than in mid-year as has been the case up until now. In all the circumstances, I do not consider that the transition to the calendar year has adversely affected cash flow for businesses.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as part of their normal arrangements, they would be prepared to discuss an individual case with the taxpayer concerned with a view to overcoming a payment difficulty. In practice this could, for example, be an agreement to pay the liability through an instalment arrangement. It is important to emphasise that a taxpayer with payment difficulties for income tax or any other tax should not ignore demands for payment but should instead make timely contact with Revenue to explain the circumstances and to settle appropriate payment arrangements.</P>

      <P>In September 2001, the Government decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. The working group to advise on implementation provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has been established. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by the Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group.</P>
      <P>The commission recommends, <i>inter alia</i>, continuation of pension increases in line with public service earnings and recommends that serving public servants make an additional explicit contribution towards the cost involved. In a change from the existing form of pay parity, the commission proposes that a single index of public service earnings be used in the future, with pension increases based on changes in the index to be paid automatically on a twice yearly basis.</P>
      <P>Public service pensioners clearly have a significant interest in these recommendations. For this reason, the Government has decided to facilitate pensioner group representation in the working group process in relation to the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy. As a first step, a number of pensioner groups attended a preliminary meeting with officials of my Department on 11 December 2001. This will be followed by a number of information seminars and a process of consultation in relation to the pensions increase index recommended by the commission. In this way pensioners and their representatives groups will have an opportunity in the months ahead to have the commission recommendations explained and examined in more detail and to participate in the consultation process which I have initiated in relation to future pensions increase policy.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash;&euro;114.28, &euro;152.39 and &euro;190.46 &ndash; in accordance with the three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high and maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22(3) and 22(4) of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination.

      <P>The working group on abuse of the elderly has met on 21 occasions to date. It was originally anticipated that its deliberations would be concluded by 31 December 2001 but, as I indicated in reply to a previous question from the Deputy on this matter, valuable time was lost in setting up the two pilot projects due to the introduction of foot and mouth disease restrictions. The new target date for submission of the report is 30 June 2002 and the working group is confident this target will be met.</P>

      <Quest>the moneys allocated to the Western Health Board for orthodontic treatment in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002; and the length of time people are on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment in the Western Health Board area.</Quest>

      <P>For orthodontic services in the Western Health Board, WHB, my Department has provided additional ongoing funding of &euro;0.089 million in 1999, &euro;0.190 million in 2000 and &euro;0.628 million in <Col N="1282" /> 2001. This brings the total budget for the service in the board to &euro;1.863 million approximately in 2002.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the WHB has informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there was a reduction of 574 patients on the board's treatment waiting list in comparison with the corresponding figure in September 2000. There is no waiting time for category A patients, those requiring priority treatment. The waiting time for treatment for category B patients, patients with less severe problems than category A patients, is 42 to 48 months. The chief executive officer of the WHB has also informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 1,511 patients in treatment in the board. This is an increase of 83 patients in orthodontic treatment in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter.</P>
      <P>Two dentists from the Western Health Board are currently in training at the Dublin Dental School and Hospital for specialist dentist in orthodontics qualifications. Both are due to qualify in June this year. Once they achieve their specialist qualification, they will be in a position to take over responsibility for a larger number of patients and further reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment. The additional funding of &euro;0.628 million allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services includes &euro;0.533 million for an orthodontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that a specialist in orthodontics has been recruited and commenced working in the board's orthodontic unit in late November last year.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, I expect that these combined developments will further increase the number of patients in orthodontic treatment in the board.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental <i>ad hoc</i> working group was set up in May 2001, under the direction of a high level steering group, to examine and report on options for the future development of the Eastern Regional Health Authority lands at Grangegorman in Dublin city. The group is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. Its terms of reference include examining how the Grangegorman site can be best developed in meeting education and social service needs; the development of facilities for the Dublin Institute of Technology on site; the provision of health facilities for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the overall development of the site, including the financing of such a development.</P>
      <P>Membership of the working group includes representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise, Health and Children, the Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin City Council and the ERHA. The group has completed its work and it is expected that its report will be submitted to Government shortly. My Department will continue to work closely with other relevant Departments and agencies to ensure that the Government's objectives to provide high quality health and education services on the site are met.</P>

      <P>On 29 November 2000, I announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service, and addressing shortages in specialist areas.</P>
      <P>As part of that initiative, nurses and midwives undertaking higher diploma and certificate courses in certain specialised areas of clinical practice receive full pay while doing so. They are also entitled to have their fees paid in full, in return for a commitment on their part to continue working within the public health service in the specialist area concerned for one year, 12 months, following completion of the course. In May 2001, I extended the range of courses covered by the initiative to include specialised areas of clinical practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative forms part of my overall nurse recruitment-retention strategy, which is currently <Col N="1285" /> funded to the level of &euro;11.5 million or £9 million annually. This is in addition to the &euro;10.8 million or £8.5 million which was allocated to health agencies for continuing nurse education between 1994 and 1999. The post-graduate diploma in clinical practice at University of Dublin, Trinity College, referred to by the Deputy relates to clinical practice generally. Since it does not lead to the award of a qualification in a specialist area of clinical practice, it is outside the scope of the funding initiative. Participants on this course may, however, apply for assistance from local continuing nurse education budgets.</P>

      <P>I established the forum on fluoridation in May 2000. The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge, spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality and health promotion, and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. The forum held its first meeting in September 2000.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the forum are to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area and to report to the Minister. The forum invited the public to forward their views on the issues under consideration and received in excess of 1,000 submissions, each of which has been examined individually. The forum's web site, http://www.fluoridationforum.ie, gives details of the forum's progress.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the forum has informed me that he expects to present the forum's report to me in the near future. In the meantime, I will not pre-empt the outcome of its deliberations.</P>

      <P>A submission from the Post Polio Support Group has been received and has been considered in my Department.</P>
      <P>At present, there are no proposals to extend automatic eligibility to people affected by this condition. However, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" />In addition, non-medical card holders and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the draft report, Men and Domestic Violence: What Research Tells Us, which was commissioned of external consultants by my Department in collaboration with the North-Eastern Health Board in 2000.</P>
      <P>In 1999-2000, the organisation AMEN, which is a voluntary support group for men who have encountered domestic abuse, sought funding from this Department. As there was no information on the incidence of domestic abuse of men in Ireland, my Department commissioned a literature review of research carried out abroad in this area. The review was to address the following: what work has been carried out in relation to prevalence of domestic violence against men and what are the findings; what paradigms are used to understand the phenomenon; what measures have been useful; what service needs have men who have been victims of violence identified; what services have been developed in other countries and what trends are known in relation to their effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kieran McKeown Limited, social and economic research consultants, were engaged to carry out this work and the draft report was presented to my Department in October 2000. My Department then sought the views of relevant official agencies on the draft report and is still receiving <Col N="1288" /> observations at present. It is hoped that final observations will be received shortly and my officials must then present these observations to the researchers to provide them with an opportunity to respond.</P>
    <P>This consultation process has raised several issues which require clarification. Until such time as these issues have been clarified it is not possible to give a commitment as to a date for publication.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services at Monaghan General Hospital rests with the North-Eastern Health Board. It is a matter for the board to determine service provision at the hospital in line with its commitment to the provision of a high quality, efficient and cost effective service as outlined in its strategy document <Col N="1291" /> for the development of acute hospital services in its region, North East Hospitals &ndash; The Next Five Years &ndash; A Framework For Continuing Development.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I visited Monaghan General Hospital recently and met hospital management and staff and representatives of local groups.</P>
      <P>A significant level of capital investment in Monaghan General Hospital is proposed in the short term; plans are being advanced by the North-Eastern Health Board for the development and upgrading of the high dependency unit at the hospital in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the development of the treatment and minor injuries unit and the development of a midwifery led unit. The associated capital cost is of the order of &euro;7 million.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the board that the development of new consultant-led services in dermatology and geriatric medicine at the hospital is also planned in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have announced the immediate commissioning process for an additional 709 acute hospital beds in public hospitals nation-wide at a cost of &euro;65 million in the current year. This is the first phase in the provision of the additional 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011. Some 38 of the additional 709 public hospital beds will be provided in the North-Eastern Health Board region with ten of these being provided in Monaghan General Hospital. All of the additional bed capacity at the hospital will be designated for public patients and will allow the hospital to significantly increase activity levels for its public patients.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the proposed development of additional consultant-led services, together with the provision of additional bed capacity and the proposed significant level of capital investment reflects the board's commitment to the provision and development of acute hospital services to the catchment area population served by Monaghan General Hospital</P>

      <P>A core theme of the new health strategy is that there must be more effective planning and development of services over a period of years. Specific targets and a framework for development are, as a result, set out for each major programme area, including intellectual disability services. It is intended to move towards greater multi-annual planning and budgeting within the obvious constraints of the prevailing economic situation and the constitutional role of the Oireachtas in relation to Estimates of expenditure. In addition, it is intended to move towards multi-annual service and support agreements with organisations funded by health agencies.</P>

    <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You, launched by the Government. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Amongst the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in <Col N="1296" /> order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>
    <P>To ensure that no one is disadvantaged by increases in social welfare rates, my Department has advised the health board chief executive officers last year and again this year that medical card holders should not lose their cards because of increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget.</P>

    <P>I am, however, committed to the introduction of a system of regulation for alternative and complementary therapists who work in this area. In June 2001, I convened a forum comprising relevant representative groups and training providers to examine and explore the practical issues involved in the preparation of a registration system for these therapists. This forum was facilitated by the Institute of Public Administration which also prepared a report of the day's dis<Col N="1298" /> cussions which was forwarded to the participants and other interested parties for consideration. I subsequently asked the Institute of Public Administration to prepare a report on proposals for the way forward. On receipt of this report, which is expected in March, I hope to be in a position to progress the issue further.</P>

      <P>Patient centred care is at the heart of the national health strategy and patient access to information about their care is an important aspect of this approach.</P>
      <P>All patients have a qualified right of access to their medical chart under the European Data Directive 95/46/EC soon to be transposed into Irish law. They also have rights to electronic records under the Data Protection Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>All patients have a qualified right of access to their medical file under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, where that is held by a health board or public hospital. This right also extends to the medical file held by the general practitioner where the patient receives services under the choice of doctor scheme. The Offices of the Information and Data Protection Commissioners respectively will be able to advise individuals on how to obtain more detailed advice.</P>
      <P>In all cases there remains a duty of care to the patient. Information likely to be injurious to the patient would be withheld. However, under the Freedom of Information Act, if that is the sole barrier to release, the information must be made available on the patient's behalf to another health professional nominated by him.</P>
      <P>In its ethical guidelines for doctors, the Medical Council advises that a request for information from a patient always requires a positive response and recommends that doctors ensure that patients are as fully informed as possible about matters relating to an illness. I hope that patients would seek information in the first place from the health professional with whom they have direct contact in the knowledge that it is possible to assert ones rights if that becomes necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Agenda 21, an action programme for socially, economically and environmentally sustainable development, was adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, endorsed by Government in 1997, reflects and takes forward in the Irish context the programme towards sustainable development set out in Agenda 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards matters for which my Department has responsibility, significant progress has been made towards good environmental management since 1992 and within the framework of national sustainable development policy. A range of measures has been taken to protect and enhance Ireland's environmental quality, including the building up of a strong and effective Environmental Protection Agency; the putting in place of a modern legislative framework for environmental protection; adoption of a national climate change <Col N="1301" /> strategy in November 2000, which sets out actions to be implemented to ensure that Ireland meets its target under the Kyoto Protocol &ndash; many of the measures are already being implemented; record investment in water services to meet development needs, tackle water quality problems, and upgrade rural water supplies; implementing water catchment management strategies and other measures to protect and improve water quality in rivers and lakes &ndash; the EPA has recently reported that river pollution has decreased for the first time in 30 years; the establishment of clear policy direction for waste management in the 1998 document, Changing Our Ways.</P>
    <P>This recognises the need for a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of an integrated waste management policy which delivers ambitious waste recycling and recovery targets and brings waste management infrastructure up to modern standards &ndash; as an example of what can be achieved, REPAK met the target to recycle 25% of packaging waste in 2001; the banning of leaded petrol, extension of the ban on smoky coal to ten further areas and substantial increases in investment in public transport; publication of revised Guidelines on Local Agenda 21 in October 2001 to help give new impetus towards local sustainable development; inclusion in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, of sustainable development as a yardstick against which development proposals are to be evaluated; the establishment and operation of Comhar to advance sustainable development on the basis of dialogue and partnership; and implementation of a major campaign to promote greater public awareness of environmental issues.</P>
    <P>In 2000, Ireland's overall performance was benchmarked against best international practice in the OECD Environmental Performance Review: Ireland, and the EPA published its Millennium State of the Environment report. Both reports acknowledged that the overall quality of Ireland's environment remains good. They noted also that the nature and pace of economic growth are now placing growing pressures on the environment, requiring policy to focus on five main challenges: better management of waste; reducing eutrophication in inland waters; protecting natural resources; controlling greenhouse gases; and protecting the urban environment, particularly from transport-related pressures.</P>
    <P>In the specific context of the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg later this year, Comhar has prepared a Report to the Earth Council: Assessment of Progress on Agenda 21, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library. Finally, the national preparatory committee for the summit is working on a review and assessment of Ireland's progress in relation to Agenda 21.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, indicated that, in common with a majority of EU member states, the Government did not propose at that stage to regulate for a specific prohibition on the use of mobile phones by drivers. The safe use of mobile phones by drivers was instead to be promoted through information campaigns, including campaigns supported by the mobile phone industry. Initiatives in this regard have been duly developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, additional considerations such as the greatly increased market penetration of mobile phones and growing concerns about the possible adverse effects on road safety when they are used inappropriately have also arisen since the strategy was adopted. I am, therefore, now considering the regulation of their use by drivers and have asked <Col N="1303" /> the high level group on road safety for a view on what could constitute appropriate measures.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the absence of a specific prohibition at present, any use of a mobile phone that results in a person driving in a manner which could be regarded as dangerous or careless may be prosecuted under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 and 275 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 734 of 30 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The nitrates directive has been substantially implemented in Ireland by way of extensive monitoring of nitrate levels in water, assessment of the trophic status of waters, the development and dissemination in 1996 of a code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates and by a range of other measures which operate to protect water quality against pollution from agricultural sources. These other measures include the provision of funding under schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, such as the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the rural environment protection scheme and the farm waste management scheme to support expenditure by farmers on measures for pollution control and environmental protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They also include by-laws made by local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, a wide range of other implementation and enforcement actions taken by local authorities under those Acts, the extension of the integrated pollution control licensing system operated by the Environmental Protection <Col N="1304" /> Agency to certain intensive agricultural activities and the introduction of requirements for compliance with good farming practice in the context of agri-assistance schemes administered by DAFRD.</P>
    <P>To date, no nitrate vulnerable zones have been designated in Ireland. However, proposals are now being developed for regulations to provide a statutory basis for the application in all areas of established standards of good farming practice. These will give further effect to a number of EU directives on waste and water quality, including the nitrates directive, and generally strengthen and support measures for the protection of the environment. I envisage that the detailed provisions of the regulations will be developed over the coming months in consultation with the main farming organisations and other interested bodies. I have already briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the general position regarding implementation of the livestock manure application limits under the nitrates directive and I intend, following discussions with the main farming organisations and other interests, to report to Government shortly with recommendations in this regard.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the national climate change strategy is to achieve reductions in Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions in order to meet obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. The potential health implications of climate change, particularly as regards the developing world, are recognised in the strategy without, however, it having been considered necessary to arrange for specialised medical input to the preparation of the strategy.</P>

      <P>Compliance with the building regulations, including part L, conservation of fuel and energy, is primarily a matter for the designers, builders and owners of the <Col N="1305" /> buildings involved. Enforcement of the regulations is the responsibility of the local building control authorities. I have consistently urged the relevant authorities to be active in enforcing building regulations and I have taken a number of measures to improve enforcement at local level including approving the creation of additional posts, where necessary, to allow building control officers and support staff to be appointed and increasing building control fees, with effect from 1 July 1998, to provide local funding for stricter enforcement.</P>
      <P>These measures are yielding results. All the authorities have now appointed building control officers. About 90% of authorities are now carrying out inspections; and three quarters have reached the target level of inspection, 12% to 15 % of developments recommended in 1993 guidelines adopted by the City and County Managers' Association. The remaining authorities have given a commitment to early achievement of the target level.</P>

    <P>I approved sewerage schemes for Athboy, Kilmainhamwood and Moynalty in the water services investment programme, 2000-2002, which I announced in July 2000.

Procurement of the works by this route will be more efficient than advancing each <Col N="1306" /> scheme separately.

      <P>With regard to the reduction in sulphur dioxide, SO2, emissions resulting from a potential ban on bituminous coal and petcoke, I refer to the reply to Question No. 706 of 30 January 2002.</P>
      <P>With regard to emissions from power generation, a number of measures have been, or will be, introduced to reduce SO2 emissions from this sector. These include the extension of the EPA's integrated pollution control licensing system &ndash; completed in January 2002 &ndash; to existing electricity generating stations; the mandatory reduction of sulphur in heavy fuel oil, including that used in power generation, to 1% from 1 January 2003 under the Air Pollution Act 1987 (Sulphur Content of Heavy Fuel Oil) Regulations, 2001. HFO in the range 1% to 3% sulphur is in use in power generation currently pursuant to a voluntary agreement with the ESB to limit total sulphur emissions to 82,000 tonnes by 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants &ndash; to be transposed into Irish law by 27 November 2002 &ndash; will regulate, for the first time, emissions of SO2 from pre-1987 large combustion plants as well as new gas turbines, will <Col N="1308" /> further reduce permitted emissions from new plants and require an assessment of the combined heat and power possibilities for new plants. The directive also provides discretionary options limiting the operational lifetime or requiring the implementation of national emission reduction plans for existing plants not meeting specified standards.</P>
    <P>All options will be considered in the context of the national emissions reduction strategy being developed to comply with Directive 2001/81/EC on national emissions ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants and the 1999 UNECE Gothenburg protocol to the convention on long range transboundary air pollution to abate acidification eutrophication and ground level ozone. Both of these require national emissions of SO2 to be reduced by 76% below 1990 levels by 2010.</P>
    <P>In addition, the national climate change strategy, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, contains a number of cross-cutting measures which will further facilitate a reduction in SO2 emissions from the power generation sector including in regard to the ESB Moneypoint plant, the single largest SO2 point source in the State, the use of cleaner fuels in, and improving the efficiency of, electricity generation.</P>

      <P>A brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare a preliminary report for a sewerage scheme at Dromcollogher was received by my Department from Limerick County Council in 1998 but has not been approved.</P>
      <P>The scheme was 16th in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by the Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-02, announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme.</P>

      <P>The driver theory test is at present available in the Irish and English languages. My Department is considering the feasibility of providing additional facilities for persons who may not be competent in these languages. Within the public private partnership structure of the driver theory test, the additional cost of such facilities would have to be borne either by service users generally or by users benefiting directly from them.</P>
      <P>Some non-national persons may, however, be eligible to drive here without having immediately to pass the theory test and the practical driving test. A person who holds a driving licence issued by a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area is permitted to drive in Ireland for so long as that licence remains valid. Where such a person has taken up normal residence in Ireland, he or she may alternatively exchange his or her licence for an Irish driving licence without taking a driving test.</P>
      <P>In addition, Australia, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, South Africa and South Korea are recognised states for the purpose of driving licence exchange under the terms of Article 30(7) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999. Under these regulations, persons holding a valid driving licence from a recognised State may exchange their licence for an Irish driving licence where they take up residence here, without the need for a driver theory test and practical driving test.</P>
      <P>Temporary visitors to Ireland who hold a national driving licence or an international driving permit may drive here for the duration of their visit up to a maximum period of 12 months. Persons taking up Irish residence must however either avail of the arrangements described above, where applicable, or begin the process of obtaining an Irish driving licence.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 298 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions that specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable depends on which <Col N="1312" /> of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical advisor, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his or her dependents.</P>
    <P>The current basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement payable in any individual case was put in place in 1996. The various types of prescribed diets are grouped into two categories, one comprising lower cost diets and the other comprising higher cost diets.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier diet supplements are paid subject to a means test and applicants are required to contribute any excess assessable means towards their food costs. For the purposes of calculating the rate of diet supplement payable, the lower cost diets which include diabetic diets, were deemed to cost &euro;34.28 per week and the higher cost diets which include gluten-free diets, were deemed to cost &euro;44.44 per week. In the case of single people, the amount payable was calculated on the basis that one third of their income is spent on food. Where the applicant is one of a couple, the amount payable was calculated on the basis that one sixth of the couple's joint income is spent on the diet supplement applicant's food.</P>
    <P>In the case of a lower cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is &euro;34.28 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple. In the case of a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is &euro;44.44 less one third of the applicant's income, one sixth in the case of a couple. Increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1996 are disregarded for the purposes of this means test as they would have the effect of reducing the rate of diet supplement payable in all cases and would eliminate entitlement altogether in many cases. In the case of children under the age of 18 there is a standard rate of &euro;10.16 per week for a higher cost diet and &euro;6.35 per week for a lower cost diet. In the case of persons with dependent children the child dependant allowance is not assessed.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is currently being reviewed as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. A fundamental examination of how diets are costed and the method of calculating the amount of supplement payable will be undertaken in this context.</P>

      <Quest>if a child being educated at home after the age of 16 automatically loses child benefit; his views on the construction of 'not attending school' as being 'in a position to earn income'; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3162/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child Benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability. Regulations prescribe the <Col N="1313" /> circumstances which determine whether a child aged 16 years or over may be regarded as receiving full-time education for child benefit purposes. These regulations stipulate that a child attending a full-time course of instruction at an institution of education is regarded as receiving full-time education. In the case of children who are being educated at home, the requirement to satisfy the full-time education condition can be fulfilled by the provision of confirmation from the Department of Education and Science that the child has registered and been accepted to sit the junior certificate or leaving certificate examination, as the case may be. This together with a declaration from the parent that their child is receiving full-time education from a suitably qualified person would suffice to allow the payment of child benefit. In reaching a determination on this matter, each case is, of course, decided on its own merits.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that one can make any assumptions in regard to whether a child is 'in a position to earn income' from the fact that a child is not attending a school. In any event, the potential of a child to earn income has no bearing on entitlement to child benefit, because the payment is not subject to a means-test. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, many children who attend school on a full-time basis, also work on a part-time basis and are not as a result precluded from receiving child benefit.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, payment of child benefit after the age of 16, is determined by reference to whether or not the child is receiving his or her education on a full-time basis. This requirement applies equally where a child is attending a school or being educated at home.</P>

      <P>The free schemes, including the electricity or gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. The free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as follows: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
      <P>The schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or receipt of a disability-related payment. Persons who are under the qualifying age or who are not in receipt of a disability-related payment may not qualify for the free schemes. Any changes in the schemes must be examined in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>However, I have recently improved other supports for widow/ers. The widowed parents' grant, which is payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow/er's contributory pension, a one-parent family payment or a bereavement grant, payable on the death of their spouse, provides additional support to those with dependent children in the very difficult, stressful and costly period immediately after a bereavement.</P>
      <P>When introduced the widowed parent's grant comprised a once-off payment of &euro;1,270. I was pleased to be in a position almost double the grant to &euro;2,500 from 5 December last year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 299 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>Two main groups have difficulties in accessing public transport: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas.</P>
      <P>This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
      <P>While my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles accessible to people with disabilities. These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise who has responsibility for public transport.</P>
      <P>In this regard, an interdepartmental committee on rural transport, chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise, is at present considering issues relating to the availability of transport services in rural areas. I understand the committee will report during this year. In addition, my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise recently announced that 19 community groups have been selected to receive funding under the rural transport initiative &ndash; RTI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the funding is to encourage innovative community-based initiatives to provide transport services in rural areas with a view to addressing the issue of social exclusion in rural Ireland which is caused by lack of access to transport. Funding of &euro;3.8 million has been provided for this purpose. My Department is in discussions with the Department of Public Enterprise on the role that the free travel scheme can play in supporting these pilot projects. It is considered that the travel needs of those in rural areas are best met through improvements in the overall transport infrastructure and in this regard the report of the interdepartmental committee, already referred to, and the experience gained from the <Col N="1317" /> schemes operating under the rural transport initiative will be important developments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the companion free travel pass scheme, these passes are available to certain people who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. The companion pass enables any person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge. In addition, since September 1998, all people aged 75 years or over, who are unfit to travel alone, qualify for a companion free travel pass. The question of making companion passes available to more free travel recipients could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was disallowed farm assist in May 2001 on the grounds that his means, derived from farm income and his wife's earnings, exceeded the appropriate limit. He appealed this decision and his case was forwarded to a social welfare inspector for further investigation in August 2001. Additional details provided by the person concerned were examined, but his means were still above the limit for receipt of farm assist. At an oral hearing of his appeal on 22 November 2001, the person concerned produced further receipts <Col N="1318" /> which he stated had been found since the inspector's last visit. The matter was again referred to a social welfare inspector for investigation.</P>
      <P>Based on the inspector's report, the appeals officer has assessed the person concerned with means of &euro;128, £101, per week which will entitle him to farm assist at the reduced rate of &euro;7.60, £5.99, per week from 26 December 2001. Had the person concerned produced all the necessary information initially, his claim could have been dealt with much more expeditiously. Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of deserted wife's allowance at the personal rate. A claim for an increase in respect of a dependent child added to her deserted wife's allowance payment was received in October 2001.</P>
      <P>In such cases, the practice is to transfer the claimant on to one-parent family payment, which is the appropriate scheme for lone parents with children. The person was awarded one parent family payment in October.</P>
      <P>A letter as issued by the Department to the person concerned on 18 October 2001, requesting her to return her deserted wife's allowance book so that her one-parent family payment book could be issued to her at the higher rate. To date, despite reminders, the requested book has not been returned to the Department. On receipt of this book, a one-parent family payment book will be sent to her designated post office, and arrears due to her will be paid by cheque.</P>

      <Quest>the changes in respect of the free fuel scheme; if his Department has correctly rounded off the conversion from the punt to the euro in relation to payments under this scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on <Col N="1319" /> long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of &euro;9 per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional &euro;3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to &euro;12.90 per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the &euro;3.90 per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable.</P>
      <P>The conditions of the scheme are that the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test, and must live alone or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in his or her own right. Over the course of the past two budgets I have introduced a number of improvements to the operation of the scheme. As the Deputy is aware, in budget 2001 I extended the duration of the fuel season from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The current fuel season commenced on 1 October 2001 and will run until 19 April 2002.</P>
      <P>The means test was also eased so that with effect from 1 October 2001 a person may now have a combined household income of up to &euro;50.79 per week or savings-investments of up to &euro;41,266.49 over and above his or her pension and still qualify for a fuel allowance. In budget 2002 I increased the payment rate of the standard fuel allowance, with effect from 1 January 2002, from £5 to &euro;9 per week.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the euro the payment rate of the smokeless fuel allowance was £3 per week. A direct conversion from punt to euro works out at &euro;3.81. For payment purposes the rate of the smokeless fuel allowance has been rounded in favour of the recipients to &euro;3.90 per week. I am satisfied that all recipients under the terms of the national fuel scheme are in receipt of the correct amount of allowance appropriate to their circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining entitlement to carer's allowance there are medical, means and residency con<Col N="1320" /> ditions which must be satisfied and there is a time lag involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable decisions to be made. The person concerned applied for a carer's allowance on 30 October 2001. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full time care and attention is required and is being provided and that the means test is satisfied.</P>
    <P>Following the necessary investigations it was established that the applicant does not provide full time care and attention and, accordingly, she was refused carer's allowance. She was notified of this decision on 29 January 2002 and of her right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's benefit on 19 November 2001. Full-time care and attention for the purposes of carer's benefit means that the care recipient's disability is such that it requires continuous supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with his or her normal personal needs. All medical evidence provided with this application was considered by the Department's medical advisor, who advised that, on the basis of the evidence, the care recipient is not in need of <Col N="1321" /> full time care and attention as required by the legislation.

      <P>Increases in short-term weekly payments such as unemployment and disability benefits are already in payment, effective from the first pay-day in January.

    <P>A further 393,000 people paid on a weekly basis on schemes where new books are due in April 2002 will also receive a lump sum during February, containing six weeks backdated payment to the start of 2002, plus an advance payment of the increase for seven weeks to bring them up to the date on which their new books arrive. A voucher in respect of this lump sum has issued to post offices for encashment when customers collect their weekly payments due on 13, 14 and 15 February. By mid-February, all customers who are paid on a weekly basis will have received their increase in full.</P>

      <P>My Department commissioned the ESRI Report, &ldquo;How Unequal, Men and Women in the Irish Labour Market&rdquo;, which found that the average hourly earnings of women were 84.5% of average male earnings. This study was commissioned on behalf of a special Partnership 2000 working group, which included representation from relevant Departments and the social partners. This research is based on a 1997 economy-wide survey of earners and includes benefits, such as pensions. The report was published by the Economic and Social Research Institute in July 2000 and was subsequently launched by me in October of that year. This research is being co-funded by the EU. The research showed that the gender pay gap had narrowed by 4.5% over a ten year period.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a consultative group was established in February 2001 and has met three times since that date to develop proposals for action to address the issues identified in the ESRI report for consideration by Government. The group, chaired by my Department, includes representatives from relevant Departments, the Central Statistics Office, the Equality Authority and the social partners. The group expects to be in a position to submit its report to Government by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>The group is also overseeing sectoral studies on male-female wage differentials in the following areas; IT, electronic and electrical, retail, food and local government.  Arising from a successful application by my Department under the EU Gender Equality Programme 2000-05, the sectoral study research will be carried out in partnership with Finland, Sweden and Northern Ireland. This project will also inform the consultative group's report to Government. This research is being co-funded by the EU and will be concluded during 2002.</P>

      <P>The programmes in respect of which the funding was allocated include residential treatment programmes for substance abusing offenders, the recruitment of additional training and employment officers for the linkage programme for the placement of offenders in employment and training, community based non &ndash; residential sex offender programmes, drug treatment for persons in custody and operation costs of new probation development centres.</P>
      <P>A total of &euro;2,155,600 of the allocation remained unspent at the end of the year. This included a sum of &euro;1,067,699 under the capital heading due to difficulties in locating suitable sites for the proposed new probation development centres. A provision of &euro;132,104 in respect of the current costs of operating the proposed centres remained unspent because the capital projects did not go ahead.</P>
      <P>Two community based sex offender treatment projects were negotiated and agreed with local groups having cross agency involvement, one in the north-west and one in the south. In only one instance, however, were arrangements sufficiently far advanced to draw down funding before the end of the year. A further sum of &euro;162,629 earmarked for these projects remained unspent as a result. The balance of the current allocation which remained unspent arose due to delays in recruiting staff for the linkage programme and for drug treatment programmes for persons in custody.</P>

Funding has been channelled through the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Following a formal external evaluation, consideration is being given, in consultation with the Garda authorities, to the appropriate funding channel with a view to establishing the procedures and structures necessary to facilitate the mainstreaming of the project.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I have received a copy of the survey report in question. While I welcome well-informed debate on crime and crime-related issues, one must, obviously, exercise caution in drawing conclusions from research conducted by particular interest groups. I do not wish to undervalue or underestimate in any way the experiences of the respondents to the National Small Business Crime Survey, 2001 who have, unfortunately, been the victims of crime. In terms of objective and scientific crime analysis, however, I think that the much more broadly based annual crime statistics compiled by the Garda Síochána provide a more reliable guide. What these statistics indicate is that crime has fallen in the period since both the first and second surveys conducted by the Small Firms Association.</P>
      <P>In terms of an effective response, the Garda authorities disseminate a comprehensive range of crime prevention advice to the business community on an ongoing basis. This is done both in person through the crime prevention officers attached to each Garda division, who carry out crime prevention surveys of public and private properties throughout the country, and through their booklet <i>A Guide to Retail Security</i>. Further support is available from the national crime prevention unit based at Harcourt Square, Dublin. In addition, business watch schemes have been developed as an important community-based initiative aimed at both small and large businesses. There are at present approximately 120 such schemes in operation throughout the country, which is a 100% increase since 1996. Under these schemes a Garda is given special responsibility to liaise with all the members in the business watch area.</P>

      <P>The prisoner referred to was sentenced to two years imprisonment at the Dublin Circuit Court on 10 July 2001 for allowing a premises to be used as a brothel. On 3 October 2001 he was transferred to the Midlands Prison from Wheatfield Prison. On committal to the Midlands Prison, he was interviewed by the Governor and he stated that he had no difficulties with anyone in prison and that he had requested the transfer to the Midlands Prison. From the date of his transfer to the Midlands Prison up to 9 January 2002, the date of the alleged incident, the prisoner never made any complaint to the prison authorities about his treatment nor did he indicate that he felt under threat from any other prisoner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Wednesday, 9 January 2002 the prisoner was one of a number of prisoners being escorted by staff to their work areas. As the group proceeded along a passageway the prisoner concerned collapsed to the ground and appeared to lose consciousness for a short period. There was no physical evidence of any injuries and the escorting officers had not seen anything that would suggest that his collapse was as a result of a physical assault. The prisoner, when interviewed at the time, stated he did not know what had happened. As a precaution he was transferred to Portlaoise General Hospital where he <Col N="1333" /> was detained overnight. The matter was investigated further and no reason has been established for his sudden collapse. The prison authorities have no evidence available to them to support any claim that the prisoner concerned was assaulted and the prisoner has indicated that he is not prepared to discuss the events of 9 January 2002. The prisoner is now on protection as a precautionary measure.</P>

      <P>The Prisons Service training centre is located in Beladd House, Portlaoise. All recruit officers receive nine weeks induction training. The induction training combines classroom tuition with job familiarisation. Classroom tuition includes lectures, practical exercises and group work on various topics such as the role of the prison officer, the administration of justice, human rights, communication and interpersonal skills. Elements of the training course require a high degree of physical activity such as the use of control and restraint techniques which may be required in emergency situations. Job familiarisation involves the assignment of recruits to places of custody for the purpose of gaining experience of the daily routine of the prison setting. The induction course may, if necessary, be broken into segments and combined with other on-the-job training.</P>

      <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three-way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the prisoner concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they are forthcoming, an application must be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his-her continued detention here. These procedures are required under the convention and must be adhered to in processing each application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm that my Department has received the formal application for transfer of the person referred to in the Deputy's question from the United Kingdom. It is currently being considered by the law officers to ensure that the requirements of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 and 1997 are satisfied. I await their advice in the matter. Unfortunately, it is not possible to say how long <Col N="1337" /> it will take for this application to be processed. However, I assure the Deputy that every effort continues to be made to complete the process as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>The advertisement placed drew attention to the main legislation sponsored by the Department of relevance to people with disabilities, including the Equal Status Act 2000, National Disability Authority Act, 1999, and the Employment Equality Act 1998, as well as highlighting the policy of mainstreaming services for people with disabilit<Col N="1339" /> ies and the Disability Bill 2001, which is currently before this House.

In the course of my reply to a matter raised by the Deputy on the Adjournment on 6 November 2001, I said that in order to achieve this transfer it will be necessary to provide substantial additional accommodation to meet the requirements of a divisional headquarters at Tallaght. I am anxious that the transfer of Garda divisional functions to Tallaght happens as quickly as possible. I am satisfied that my Department, in conjunction with the other parties involved &ndash; in particular the Garda authorities and the Office of Public Works &ndash; is making every effort to ensure that the necessary new works will be carried out with the minimum of delay.

As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is intended that these ten CCTV systems will be installed and operational by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. Tenders have been sought and received in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. The evaluation process is in its final stages and I hope to announce the awarding of the contracts shortly, after which work will commence immediately to put the systems in place.</P>

      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy. The national drugs strategy team, NDST, is a cross-departmental team comprising of representatives from a number of Departments and agencies. The role and terms of reference of the NDST are clearly set out in the national drugs strategy 2001-2008 which was launched in May 2001.</P>
      <P>As recommended in the strategy, the membership, supports and staffing of the NDST have been the subject of a review by independent consultants which has recently been completed. The question of representation by my Department on the NDST was examined in this context and the recommendations in the consultant's report are currently being considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>Tourism Ireland Limited &ndash; TIL &ndash; is the new all-island tourism marketing company that was established in December 2000 by Bord Fáilte &ndash; BFE &ndash; and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board &ndash; NITB &ndash; under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement. Its operations are governed by a memorandum and articles of association and it is accountable to the North South Ministerial Council. TIL has responsibility <Col N="1344" /> for all-Ireland destination marketing, the delivery abroad of regional and product marketing and promotion activity on behalf of BFE and NITB, the overseas marketing office network and Tourism Brand Ireland. It recently launched its 2002 comprehensive marketing plan that has been designed to address the current market situation, with a view to recovering as much business as possible and a return to 2000 business levels.</P>
      <P>Complementing the role of TIL are the initiatives being pursued by Bord Fáilte Éireann, whose mandate in terms of tourism product development-investment and regional tourism development, through the regional tourism authorities, in the South remained unchanged with the setting up of Tourism Ireland Limited.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte Éireann's tourism product development scheme was launched last week and applications were invited on Friday, 1 February 2002. The scheme has a particular focus on the less developed tourism areas, which would include the counties listed by the Deputy, and makes provision for public sector investment of &euro;130 million in the next five years.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, provision is made for the upgrading and packaging of geographically and financially sustainable clusters of existing attractions, including, where necessary, support for investment in some new projects identified as essential for the completion of such clusters. A cluster is defined as a grouping of complementary tourist attractions and facilities that have the potential to develop and contribute to the implementation of a coherent marketing strategy. Such clusters will be identified by the relevant regional tourism authorities, or Shannon Development in its region.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, prospective applicants who would consider that a cluster might maximise its potential by including a Northern based project, even though such a project could not itself be funded under the scheme, should contact the relevant regional tourism authority from whom full details of the scheme can be obtained.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001, with a closing date of 4 January 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,300 applications were received before the closing date. These applications are currently being evaluated by officers from the sports unit <Col N="1345" /> of my Department against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</P>
      <P>These criteria include: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport-recreational sport and-or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, that is, does the project comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities; possession of planning permission; the financial viability of the project, that is, in addition to lottery funding, has the club-organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe; the level of local funding available &ndash; higher rating is given to projects with a significant local contribution; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area and the current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements-facilities in relation to the club's or organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>
      <P>During the assessment process, my Department will consult, as appropriate, with other Departments, State agencies and national governing bodies of sport. Each application is scored between zero and five under the assessment criteria outlined above, depending on the extent to which they meet the criteria. Different &ldquo;weights&rdquo;&ndash; from one to four &ndash; are attached to the various criteria depending on their importance. For each of the criteria, the score multiplied by the weight gives the total points achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of this process each application receives a score, which decides its order of priority within its own county. Recommendations, based on conclusions from this process and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution, are made to me and I then make the final decision on projects and grants to be allocated. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the 2002 programme as soon as poss<Col N="1346" /> ible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      <P>I am fully supportive of the RAPID programme as there is undoubtedly a strong link between poor educational achievement and socio-economic deprivation.</P>
      <P>While my Department, as currently structured, is not in a position at present to provide representation on each of the 25 RAPID area implementation teams, it is working towards the implementation of a programme of structural reform which envisages, among other elements, the capacity to participate in local and regional developments, such as the RAPID initiative. I have, in the meantime, nominated an assistant secretary general from my Department to participate in the work of the RAPID national monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>In addition, as a first step towards participation by my Department in local and regional developments, seven senior personnel were nominated in October 2001 to support the work of the 14 local drugs task forces. These task forces are considered by the Government to be the initial priority areas in view of the serious drug problems being experienced by these communities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has an extensive range of programmes in place that provide direct support and assistance to individual schools serving areas of greatest disadvantage. These include the following Giving Children an Even Break, the new programme for pupils in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds. This provision now incorporates schools that already have designated disadvantaged status and schools in the urban dimension of Breaking the Cycle. Schools in the latter project have being allocated additional funding under the new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools categorised as urban-town with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported where necessary through the three-year period of the programme by staff allocations to implement a PTR of 20:1 in the junior classes <Col N="1351" />&ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a maximum of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.</P>
    <P>These are two initiatives aimed at increasing the retention of pupils in school, namely the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative &ndash; ESLI &ndash; and the stay in school retention initiative &ndash; SSRI &ndash; at second level. A total of 149 post primary schools and 51 primary schools are supported by these initiatives. Proposals for a significant expansion of these initiatives, which will focus on areas with the greatest pupil retention difficulties, are currently under consideration in the Department. The home-school-community liaison scheme promotes parental collaboration with teachers in the children's learning. The fifth element is learning support and resource teachers.</P>

      <P>The optimum solution to the issues raised by the Deputy lies in realigning the assessment arrangements in subjects such as metalwork that generate artefacts. At present, the practical pieces in a number of subjects are examined in individual schools and, consequently, there are no logistical difficulties involved in returning the material. There are, however, short-term storage issues for the schools, which make it difficult to expand the number of subjects where the schools retain the material to include subjects like metalwork.</P>

      <P>I have sought to ensure that there is a proper legislative underpinning to school attendance. I see the recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act 2000 achieving this. The Act provides for the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board and a nationwide educational welfare service, with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education. Section 14 of the Act requires that the National Educational Welfare Board establish and maintain a register of all children in receipt of education in a place other than a recognised school. The board has been established on an interim basis and I have given approval for the recruitment of a chief executive officer. The service will be implemented on a phased basis in line with a plan to be developed by the board.</P>
      <P>Parents who opt to educate their children at home will have the protections outlined in the Act available to them. In addition, they have access to the State's examinations system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level insti<Col N="1354" /> tutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate &ndash; PLC &ndash; courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, students who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million &ndash; £1.964 million &ndash; in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million &ndash; £5.9 million &ndash; in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 and 388 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies refer to the fund for the development of targeted responses to children at risk that is overseen by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. The purpose of this fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>An application for funding under this scheme was received from Ballybeg Community Education Project in 2001. Proposals submitted were appraised using the following criteria: whether the proposal addresses an identified need or needs of the target group in a meaningful way; whether the proposal has got potential to be applied on a broader basis; whether the proposal contributes to the advancement of Department policy on the retention and participation of the target group in education and training; the extent to which the proposal uses a multi-agency approach to achieve stated outcomes; and whether the sponsoring group has demonstrated its capacity to plan and manage the project to its conclusion.</P>
      <P>In assessing applications, consideration was also given to Department supported interventions already in place in the areas concerned so as to avoid duplication of effort and resources. In this regard, my Department is providing support for an eight to 15 early school leaver project &ndash; ESLI &ndash; in the Ballybeg area. It was considered that there was a substantial overlap between the aims and objectives the target group identified and the services provided under both the ESLI project and the Ballybeg community education project. It was therefore decided that it would be inappropriate to continue to fund these projects on a separate basis. Accordingly, both projects have been requested to come together to develop a joint proposal for consideration by my Department. I have arranged for a co-ordinator to work with both groups with a view to developing a holistic plan that addresses the educational needs of the children at risk in the Ballybeg area.</P>

      <Quest>the number of specialist teachers in music and music technology within the school system; the number of music inspectors nationally; the number of posts of responsibility for music education within the primary and secondary system; his plans to implement the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on music and education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two second-level inspectors of music in my Department. At primary level, inspectors evaluate and advise on music education in the context of the arts within a broadly integrated curriculum.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy on the number of specialist teachers of music is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Music technology is an optional component of the revised leaving certificate music syllabus introduced in 1999. To ensure the satisfactory implementation of this syllabus, a comprehensive two-year programme of in-career development for teachers of music, including courses in music technology, was set in place. Further courses for teachers are provided on an ongoing basis. In relation to music technology, an innovative pilot project has been established in five schools in Cork under the schools integration project &ndash; SIP &ndash; which is part of the schools' IT2000 initiative. It is envisaged that the outcomes of this project will assist in informing future policy in this area.</P>
      <P>The allocation of duties to holders of posts of responsibility in primary schools is a matter for individual boards of management and relates to the organisational needs of schools. There is no direct connection in second-level schools between a teacher's field of expertise and his or her promotion to a post of responsibility. The number and level of posts of responsibility in a second-level school is determined by the number of whole-time teacher equivalents in the school. The duties assigned to posts is a matter for the school authorities, having regard to the agreed schedule of posts.</P>
      <P>However, following a review of the provision for music within the City of Dublin, City of Limerick and County Cork Vocational Education Committee schemes, my Department has approved a new post of responsibility system for these music schemes. The vocational education committees concerned are in the process of implementing this new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the implementation of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on music in education, I would draw to the attention of the Deputy the following additional developments towards improvement in the teaching and assessment of music. At primary level, the revised music curriculum will be formally implemented in primary schools from the 2004-2005 school year in line with the primary curriculum support pro<Col N="1359" /> gramme schedule, following an intensive national training programme. In the context of expanding support for curriculum implementation generally, an innovative &euro;7.75 million grant package for arts education, including music, was provided for all primary schools in 2001. The teacher guidelines accompanying the revised music curriculum deal comprehensively with the issues of specialist music teaching and instrumental music within the school and, in addition, encourage schools to make use of music education resources within the wider school community such as those identified by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>At second level, the increase in numbers of students taking music as a subject is to be welcomed, as is the assessment structure that allows students to specialise in the component of the course best suited to their interests and ability. The broad range of performance options available to students has increased accessibility to the subject and allows for students of diverse music backgrounds to participate in the subject.</P>
    <P>In general terms, quality assurance activity such as the school development planning initiative, the continuing support of my Department's in-career development unit for music education courses and initiatives and the ongoing work of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in reviewing programmes and syllabi will contribute significantly to improvements in the area of music education.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>Each year, the higher education grants scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the schemes. The approved institutions mainly comprise publicly funded third level institutions. The LSB College, which is the college attended in the case in question, is not an approved college for the purpose of the scheme. Any extension to the scope of the grants scheme to include private colleges such as LSB College can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>
      <P>Tax relief is available at the standard rate on tuition fees paid to certain private colleges, including LSB College. Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

      <P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued Child Dependant Allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate &ndash; PLC &ndash; courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of <Col N="1362" /> maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, students who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million &ndash; £1.964 million &ndash; in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million &ndash; £5.9 million in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>Pupils with autism are generally catered for in special schools or in special classes attached to ordinary schools. At present, there is a total of 98 special dedicated classes in place catering for children with autism. These classes are in both ordinary and special schools with the main developments now taking place in ordinary schools. Each class caters for a maximum of six pupils and has the support of a minimum of one teacher and two special needs assistants. Pupils attending such classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service and the escort service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, children with autism can be supported in mainstream primary schools with the support of the resource teacher and-or special needs assistant service. There are currently in <Col N="1363" /> excess of 1,500 resource teachers and 3,000 special needs assistant posts in place in the primary system.</P>
    <P>My Department also supports a pilot project in Cork which caters for 30 children with autism. This project, which delivers an applied behaviour analysis model of response, was established in 1999 and is operating on a five-year pilot basis. My Department is also funding the operation of two further pilot projects, in Kildare and North Dublin, using the ABA model of response.</P>

      <Quest>the action he is taking on foot of his meeting with parents of the Patrician College, Ballyfin, County Laois regarding their objections to the proposed amalgamation of their school with Portlaoise VEC; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that parents are dissatisfied with his Department's response so far to their concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The management authorities at the Patrician College, Ballyfin indicated to my Department some time ago that they were not in a position to continue to provide post-primary education in Ballyfin. As an alternative, they proposed to participate in the management of an amalgamated community college with County Laois VEC. I should emphasise that, as trustees of the Patrician College, the decision to withdraw from trusteeship and management of the school is a matter for the Patrician Brothers. The issue for me as Minister for Education and Science is how post-primary educational provision in the catchment should be structured to best effect, having regard to the brothers' decision and the major capital funding required by the other post-primary schools in the area. Taking all factors into account, I am of the view that the appropriate course of action is to support the decision taken by the Patrician Brothers and the VEC to amalgamate in a new community college on the outskirts of Portlaoise. Substantial capital investment in three modern schools in Portlaoise is the best strategy for meeting the needs of all students of the catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met with representatives of the Ballyfin parents' council last December and listened to their concerns. In the interim, officials of my Department have also met with representatives of the parents and teachers at the school, whose objec<Col N="1366" /> tive is to retain a post-primary school in Ballyfin. The representatives were given the opportunity to submit to me their views regarding the proposed amalgamation and my officials are awaiting their response. That meeting has given rise to issues which my Department wishes to clarify with the trustees, the Patrician Brothers, and County Laois VEC and a meeting with those parties has been arranged for Wednesday, 6 February.</P>

      <P>In September 2001, I announced the creation of an action group on access to third level education, to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access to third level education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. At the launch of the action group, I announced, as an initial step, pending the findings of the group, the introduction of special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders in 2001. In its report, which I launched in July 2001, the group set out detailed recommendations relating to the criteria to apply on the introduction of the special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &lsquo;those most in need' could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over but subject to specific conditions, namely, he, or she, must qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants; total reckonable income, in the tax year to 5 April 2001, must not exceed &euro;9,396; and as at 1 April 2001, the applicant's spouse or partner must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments and be in receipt of full-rate qualified adult allowance, or similar entitlement, in respect of the applicant, or, the applicant must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to education allowance &ndash; BTEA &ndash; administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is not an eligible pay<Col N="1367" /> ment where the applicant for the special rates of maintenance grant is him/herself in receipt of the allowance. However, the BTEA is an eligible payment in cases where an applicant for the special rate is being assessed on parents-guardians income or on the income of a spouse-partner. I have given a commitment that the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in its first year of operation.</P>

      <P>Appointments to assistant principal and special duties teacher posts of responsibility in community schools are made by the board of management. Circulars issued by my Department prescribe detailed procedures and criteria which apply to boards in selecting teachers for appointment to posts of responsibility. The procedures include provision for the submission of an appeal by an unsuccessful candidate against a proposed appointment to an independent arbitrator. These procedures are designed to ensure that selection processes operate fairly and that individuals who may have grievances have the opportunity to have their case heard and determined by an independent arbitrator. In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy an appeal was lodged against a proposed appointment to an assistant principal post. The appeal was upheld by the arbitrator and, in accordance with the agreed procedures, a new competition for the filling of the post was held. To date, my Department has not been informed by the school authorities of the outcome of that competition.</P>

      <P>My policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools. However, the nature and level of the special educational response provided is largely based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. The national educational psychological service, which was established in 1999, employs qualified educational psychologists to provide the assessment service. Students who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes and units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports.</P>
      <P>Children attending on a fully integrated basis are supported by the resource teacher service and the special needs assistant service. At present, there are approximately 1,500 resource teachers and 3,000 special needs assistants in place in primary schools supporting children with special educational needs on an integrated basis. Children with more severe levels of disability may require placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school. Each such facility is dedicated to a particular disability group and each operates at a specially reduced pupil teacher ratio. There are 108 special schools and approximately 600 special classes in the system at present. Pupils attending such facilities attract special rates of capitation funding and are entitled to avail of the special school transport service and the school bus escort service.</P>
      <P>Under a Government decision of October 1998, all children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their level of need or location. All schools have been advised of the procedures through which they may gain access to the above range of services.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department decided to examine post-primary provision in the area referred to by him with a view to possible rationalisation. This decision was taken in light of capital grant applications received from all five post-primary schools in the centre, including the school referred to by the Deputy. It has now been decided to extend the scope of this examination to include the five primary schools in the area.</P>
      <P>In view of the extent of this examination, I have decided to appoint a facilitator, Dr. Tom McCarthy, to consult with the local providers with a view to identifying the key issues in relation to primary and post primary school provision in the area. Dr. McCarthy has been supplied with briefing material by the planning and building unit of my Department and is expected to visit the area immediately. It is my intention to make a decision on how best to address the future primary and post-primary requirements of the centre referred to by the Deputy, as early as possible, following consideration of Dr. McCarthy's recommendations in the matter.</P>

      <P>Requirements in this area are kept under review by my Department in consultation with the authorities of the colleges of education, which specialise in the training of primary teachers.

      <P>The allocation for post primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;182.31 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in post-primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Due to the greatly increased level of investment in the post-primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>

      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress <Col N="1387" /> Bill, 2001 is progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas and Report Stage is scheduled for 20 February 2002.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Second Stage debate the question of the scope of this Bill to deal with abuse that took place outside of residential institutions as defined in the Bill was raised. I said in that debate that this Bill deals with a particular situation &ndash; abuse in industrial schools, reformatories, orphanages and similar kinds of institutions. This is an issue which was brought graphically to light by publications, documentaries and the accounts of survivors in recent years. The purpose of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill is to deal with cases where children were abused while the State was acting to a significant degree <i>in loco parentis</i> in relation to children removed by the State from their parents and placed out of their protection.</P>
      <P>Abuse is always wrong. However in the case of special schools attended by children who were deaf and-or blind, in some cases the children went home to their parents on weekends or for holidays. This was different from the regime which obtained in most of the residential institutions. That said, as a result of representations made during the course of the Bill's passage through the Houses I intend to review this further and I will come back to it again on Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are no provisions at present under which teaching service given in Northern Ireland by teachers now working here may be reckoned in this jurisdiction for pension purposes. A working group, consisting of representatives of the Northern Ireland Department of Education and of representatives of my Department and of the Department of Finance, established in the context of North-South co-operation, is examining the question of reciprocal arrangements for the transfer of pension rights between the respective jurisdictions, including the UK generally. There are complex technical and financial issues involved which require careful and detailed consideration by the working group. It is expected the group will report later this year. Any proposals emanating from the group's work for an equitable reciprocal transfer arrangement will then be given full consideration.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any arrangements proposed under EU directives or any advice from the EU on such transfers.</P>

      <Quest>the categories of teacher which are exempt from examination in relation to the Cáilíocht examination for primary teachers trained outside the State; if the exemption applies to those with leaving certificate honours Gaeilge, or with a primary degree in Gaeilge; if one or all of the examination modules contains an oral element examination; the numbers who have passed modules one, two and three of the examination; the numbers who passed any module at the October 2001 sitting; the number of candidates who are entered for the next sitting; the support given by his Department to persons undertaking a programme of preparation for the examination; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Exemption from the Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge examination is granted to teachers who have qualified as primary teachers in St. Mary's College, Belfast, having successfully completed the four years honours academic Irish <Col N="1390" /> course. Furthermore, a full exemption also applies to teachers who have completed their postgraduate certificate in education through the medium of Irish in that college. To receive full recognition as a primary teacher in this State, graduates from either of the above courses must also satisfy the Gaeltacht requirements for full recognition as a primary teacher, that is, they must provide certification to my Department that they have resided in the Gaeltacht while attending an approved three week Irish language course or its aggregated equivalent.</P>
      <P>Candidates who have Irish to primary degree level may be granted exemption from paper 2 of the SCG examination. However, candidates do not qualify for any exemption on foot of holding leaving certificate honours Gaeilge. Circular 25/00, which issued to all schools in 2000, gives further information relating to the process of recognition of teachers trained abroad and to applying to sit the SCG examination.</P>
      <P>The SCG examination is held twice annually and consists of four separate modules, an oral examination; an aural examination; paper 1 &ndash; composition; grammar; written comprehension; paper 2 &ndash; the teaching of Irish; literature; cultural aspects.</P>
      <P>At the October 2001 sitting of the examination, 82 candidates achieved a pass in one or more modules of the examination; 32 candidates passed paper 1; 19 passed paper 2; 37 passed the aural examination; and 50 passed the oral examination. The number of candidates who will enter for the next sitting of the SCG in April is not yet known.</P>
      <P>Courses in Irish, catering specifically for candidates for the SCG, are provided through the Education Centre Network. I also recently established a working group to review the syllabus and examination for the SCG. This review will involve two stages, a short-term review and a long-term review. It is intended that a report arising from the short-term review will be completed by the end of this month and the long-term review will be completed in the autumn of 2002.</P>
