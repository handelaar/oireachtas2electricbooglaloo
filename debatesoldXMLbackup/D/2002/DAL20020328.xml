However, our party has been asked to give its assent to the rubber-stamping without debate of 21 completely diverse items between yesterday and today and we simply will not do so. The repetition of the litany of diverse items that you read, a Cheann Comhairle, is an indication of how panic stricken is the Government.</P>

      <P>Backbenchers in Fianna Fáil might be happy to acquiesce in this proposal but I remind the House that this is the culture of corner cutting and doing things in haste that has led to the litany of revelations at the Committee of Public Accounts and has brought about the falling on his faithful sword of &ldquo;my best friend forever&rdquo;, Mr. Teahon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This may very well be rubber-stamp democracy as far as Fianna Fáil is concerned but as far as the Labour Party is concerned, this is not the way to do business and if the Government wants evidence of that, it should examine what has emerged in respect of the Campus Stadium Ireland development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the passage of this raft of measures without debate, particularly No. 40. Nowhere have I seen an example of more slovenly incompetence than in regard to this issue. I have been pressing for two years for Ireland to ratify the Rome statute to enable us to participate in setting up the international criminal court. I have been told repeatedly during that time that significant legislation was needed to enable us to ratify the statute. As recently as last Wednesday in the House, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated this could be not be done because of the need for such legislation, yet by magic we can ratify the statute today without putting legislation in place to underpin ratification.</P>
      <P>This is a display of absolute and utter incompetence on the part of the Government as it endeavours to have Ireland ratify an international agreement without putting in place the measures domestically to enable us to comply with our international obligations. The only reason I do not call on the House to oppose the motion is that I have been pressing for years for the House to ratify the statute. A crazy precedent is being established and it is an example of the Government's utter incompetence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard of painting by numbers, but this is politics by numbers. The House resembles a bingo hall more than Dáil Éireann. I refer to No. 40, which relates to the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal. It is on the Order of Business as a motion to be passed without debate. To be responsible to the people, who had expectations of the tribunal, we must make sure it reports before the election. This is mushroom treatment of people by keeping them in the dark as we enter the election campaign without a report from the tribunal. We cannot agree to the Order of Business until the terms of reference include an interim report and a debate in the House, which is suggested on page 1 of the Order of Business but is deleted on page 2.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sargent asked about the resolution amending the terms of reference of the tribunals of inquiry. He is correct that it will be taken without debate. However, the resolutions were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in July last to amend the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal to allow for an increase of the tribunal's membership from one to three, one of whom would be the chairman, Mr. Justice Fergus Flood, and the appointment of a reserve member. The reserve member will sit at the tribunal to hear evidence with a view to him or her being available to become a member of the tribunal in the event that an existing member is for any reason unable to sit.</P>
      <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, which has completed its passage through both Houses and is expected to be signed by the President later today, will provide a new statutory basis for appointing additional members and reserve members to the tribunals. The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the Flood tribunal resolutions passed last July should be revised to reflect the new legislation and relayed before both Houses. It has not been possible to do so before now, as the Bill is only expected to be signed into law today. A copy of the revised resolutions is being put before the House.</P>
      <P>This is purely a technical exercise which in no way changes the substance of what the Houses have approved. The Opposition spokespersons, Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Gilmore, have indicated agreement to revised resolutions being taken without debate. The new resolutions must be approved today. Without them, the new members cannot be appointed to the Flood tribunal. The new members have been selected and were approved by the Government on 19 February. Upon their appointment as Circuit Court judges, Mr. Alan Mahon, SC, and Ms Mary Flaherty, SC, will be appointed as additional members of the tribunal and Mr. Gerry Keys, BL, will be appointed as the reserve member. The additional and reserve members will be formally appointed by an instrument to be made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government immediately following the enactment of the Court and Court Officers Bill, which is before the House.</P>

      <P>The Government's Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002, has been rejected out of hand by the interest groups. The Minister did not have discussions with the Autism Association of Ireland. In the course of the debate in the Seanad the Bill was strongly opposed by everybody other than Government Senators and the support given by the Government for the proposal has been extremely weak. In view of this and the fact that the commitments given by the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science have been rowed back, will the Taoiseach announce the withdrawal of the Bill? It does not meet the needs of the persons it is supposed to serve.</P>

      <P>I will start again: Is the Taoiseach aware of the widespread outrage being expressed by many people about the way in which for the second time in days, if not weeks, they are seeing the spectacle of this legislation being rammed through?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is so riven with guilt he has to interrupt me because he knows he is treating those with disabilities with contempt.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach explain why the Government acquiesced to this shoddy procedure? Will he do to this Bill what he did to the other disabilities Bill, which has been effectively buried and put on the shelf?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will recall that over the past number of weeks I have been asked practically every day about this Bill. I was asked on Tuesday if we would try to get it through the House this week. The Bill will confer statutory rights on people with disabilities to an appropriate education and it will provide a framework within which that can be delivered. The Bill as published is based on examples of best practice from other jurisdictions, notably the United States and United Kingdom. I recall people who lobbied me on this issue saying we should look at the United States.</P>
      <P>The Bill draws on recommendations of various expert groups such as the task force on autism and the special education review committee. Most important, it provides in law what many parents have long demanded &ndash; close involvement in decisions on their children's education, a statutory right to assessment of needs and a statutory duty on the State to fulfil those needs, as well as individual education plans, early intervention, integrated education, continual education, training for adults with special needs and co-ordinated action by education and health agencies. That is what the Bill gives &ndash; it gives all these statutory rights to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister recognised that there was limited time to enact the Bill and realised that if he did not do so then the Bill could drift on. He was under considerable pressure to have it before Easter, which is not possible, but it went through the Seanad, where there was an excellent and comprehensive debate. I note what Deputies Noonan and Quinn have said and people have also contacted my office about the Bill, but most of the facts put forward &ndash; admittedly in a short space of time &ndash; are entirely wrong. The Minister's Department has given me the replies to those points. Over the next two and a half weeks, the Minister will meet the organisations concerned so they can put their views to him. When we come back we can make the amendments they seek. However, most of the amendments I have been given overnight are already in the Bill, so people are misreading the Bill. Maybe that is due to pressure of time but that can be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with points made in the media, provision is made for children between birth and the age of three where there are specific education needs, although not all children with disabilities need education during this period. There are specific statutory rights for adults to continu<Col N="913" /> ing education, in particular in the cases of those who are severely or profoundly disabled. The Bill provides for lifelong education and personal development, with a qualified teacher as part of the multidisciplinary team providing services. The Bill has no impact whatsoever on access to the courts, which is another point. While it does provide an alternative through a mediation and appeals system, it does not stop a person enforcing his or her rights under the Bill in the courts, as has been said today in the media. The Bill specifically provides that the services proposed in the Bill by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can be engaged by parents in relation to education issues. Assessment issues can be appealed to an independent appeals body. All of these points have been made but they are incorrect.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is value in the Minister being able to clarify these issues. People will see the enormous benefits in the legislation and unless there is some other motivation, people will be only too glad to see the Bill being passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will appreciate how stressful long-term caring is, as will all Members from their constituency work in meeting the parents of disabled children. What always comes across is the amount of ongoing stress in their lives and how they feel they are let down when they seek assistance from the State. As we speak, the parents of autistic children and their representatives are meeting in a hotel across the road. This proposal by the Minister, no matter how well-meaning, has failed to meet identified needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach could relieve an awful lot of stress for many people by giving a signal that this Bill will not be hammered or dragooned through as drafted. While it might be a vehicle for the delivery of services required, it is an inadequate vehicle and there will be no attempt to complete it in this House until serious amendments are made. The Taoiseach should make that commitment this morning. Many people are stressed by the prospect of ongoing caring for a close relative in circumstances where they feel the State has let them down, where their loved ones' constitutional rights are not being vindicated in legislation and where services are not being put in place.</P>
      <P>This may be our last day here. I ask the Taoiseach to give the signal that he will not dragoon the Bill through as drafted because regardless of the Minister's intentions, he has failed to deliver what is needed. The Bill is now an added focus of stress for carers rather than a relief for their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy Noonan said. All of us have experience of dealing with people with disabilities and trying <Col N="914" /> to assist them. That is what the Minister is trying to do. I emphasise that no effort is being made to rush the Bill through. The only reason we are pressing hard is that various committees and Members have said week in, week out that they want the Bill to come forward so that there is not a long delay. People outside the House have also lobbied for this for a considerable length of time, identifying the areas to be examined.</P>
      <P>The Minister was asked to look at other jurisdictions, particularly the UK and the US. He was asked to take into account the views of the task force on autism, the special education review and the representations that have been made to him by almost every Deputy in the House. We were trying to get on with the Bill because we know there are special needs. It is not being pushed through just yet and it can be dealt with over Easter.</P>
      <P>I merely pointed out earlier that a group of people made 11 points in relation to the Bill last evening, nine of which were wrong, and that the Minister has to point out such errors. Officials dealing with the Bill believe the group is misreading the other two issues. There may more than 11 concerns, but I can comment only on those I have encountered. The group will have an opportunity to meet the Minister in the next few weeks. I assure Deputy Noonan that the Government is seeking to confer statutory rights, such as the right to an appropriate education, on people with disabilities and to provide a framework within which the rights can be delivered. The conferring of the statutory right to an assessment of needs and the provision of the necessary resources for intervention, early education, integrated education and continuing education will go an long way to addressing the problems in this area. The Minister, Deputy Woods, will listen to genuine amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Education and Science is here as my question for the Taoiseach relates to him. More than three months have passed since my colleague, Deputy Shortall, raised in the House the question of the 850 school buildings which are at various stages of application in the Department of Education and Science's building unit in Tullamore. The Taoiseach is aware from his many trips around the country that construction is one of the issues most often raised by associations representing pupils, teachers, parents, principals and school managers. They want to know where their applications stand in the queue in Tullamore and when they will hear whether refurbishment, an extension or a new building will be cleared to commence. The Minister for Education and Science gave an undertaking in the House at the end of January that he would publish the list so we could see the status of applications. If schools knew they had to wait for a few years, they would be able to proceed with the rest of their business. We accept there is a massive capital programme but, sadly, it has been brought to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" />Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Education and Science has reneged on his promise to publish the list? Does he intend to hold the Minister to account as regards the publication of the list? Does he agree there is a crisis of morale in the education system, part of which relates to the substandard physical working conditions tolerated by teachers? Does the Taoiseach believe the problem of morale, which will be strongly vented at the teachers' conferences next week, could be partly alleviated with a dose of honesty and transparency on the part of the Department of Education and Science? The list of schools should be published and accompanied by a timetable. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he intends asking or directing the Minister to publish the list, with its associated detail, including a timetable of provision, so school authorities know where they stand? I am aware that the list exists and that it is a matter of concern for all in the education system. Will it be published as soon as possible?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

      <P>In response to Deputy Noonan's point, as I understand it, allocations for this year are being made on an ongoing basis. There is no question of holding back as the Minister has been clearing the list and will continue to do so. Many allocations have been made for this year and resources have not been held back. The funds available to the Department are being distributed in many cases to meet contractual commitments. The point has been made that we should take into account the various stages of development, but it does not matter as long as a contractual commitment is in place. The Minister can outline the status of the 850 major projects, but it is important that we remember that thousands of schools are at different stages of development for smaller projects like computer rooms and science laboratories. It is not easy to clarify the status of all 4,000 schools, but the Minister intends to produce as comprehensive a list as soon as possible.</P>

A list has not been presented before but the Minister is endeavouring to produce a list that will give, to the best of his ability and that of the officials preparing it, the stages of development of the schools. The point I was making was that as architectural designs move on, as sites are achieved and work proceeds, that list is continually changing because the Minister has resources to spend. He has confirmed to me that he does not have a problem with using the resources which have been passed by the House. That is not his problem. He might have a problem if he did not have sufficient resources, which is always a problem for a Minister for Education.

This decision is based on the fact that ratification of the statute and the creation of the court enjoy cross-party support in the State as well as the democratic mandate as expressed in a constitutional referendum last year. We can therefore reasonably expect that the implementation legislation will be enacted before the court becomes operational, thus allowing the State to comply with any obligations under the statute. The legislation is being drafted. I do not have a date for its introduction but it will be done as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>&ndash;bearing in mind the serious public concern about allegations that members of the Garda Síochána in the Donegal Division engaged in unethical and criminal behaviour;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;noting the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in November, 2001, to request Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, to conduct an independent <Col N="927" /> review of all the relevant papers and the progress on the investigations into these allegations generally with a view to the Minister receiving expert independent advice as to whether there are measures that might now be taken to bring matters to finality sooner rather than later;</P>
    <P>&ndash;noting that having completed his review, it is the opinion of Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, that a tribunal of inquiry represents the only comprehensive method of inquiry to resolve outstanding issues of fundamental public importance;</P>
    <P>&ndash;mindful that a number of criminal proceedings have been instituted arising from some of these allegations, and mindful of the ongoing investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron, and not wishing to prejudice these or related criminal proceedings;</P>

    <P>(<i>a</i>) The making of extortion and hoax telephone calls to the home of Michael and Charlotte Peoples on 9 November 1996 and the subsequent Garda investigation into that complaint;</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) Investigations in relation to the death of Mr. Richie Barron of Raphoe, County Donegal on 14 October 1996 with particular reference to the arrest and treatment of persons in custody in connection with that investigation, the progress, management and effectiveness of the Garda investigation with particular reference to the management of informants;</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) Allegations of harassment of the McBrearty family of Raphoe, County Donegal and of relatives, associates and agents of that family by members of the Garda Síochána subsequent to the death of Mr. Barron including the issue and prosecution of summonses relating to offences alleged to have occurred between 28 October 1996 and 28 September 1998;</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) The circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of Mark McConnell on 1 October, 1998 and Michael Peoples on 6 May 1999;</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) Complaints that some gardaí in County Donegal may have been involved in hoax explosives and bomb-making equipment finds (in particular discoveries on 11 September 1993, 19 November 1993, 11 January 1994, 14 March 1994, 4 June 1994, 13 June 1994 and 18 July 1994) and a review of the <Col N="928" /> management and investigation of these issues;</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>) The circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of Frank McBrearty Jnr. on 4 February 1997 and his subsequent prosecution in the Circuit Criminal Court in relation to an alleged assault in December 1996 on Edward Moss with particular reference to the Garda investigation and the management of both the investigation and the role of the gardaí in the subsequent prosecution;</P>
    <P>(<i>g</i>) Allegations relating to the Garda investigation of an arson attack on property situated on the site of the telecommunications mast at Ardara, County Donegal in October-November 1996;</P>
    <P>(<i>h</i>) Allegations contained in documents received by Deputy Jim Higgins on 25 June 2000 and in information received by Deputy Brendan Howlin on 25 June 2000 that two senior members of An Garda Síochána may have acted with impropriety;</P>
    <P>(<i>i</i>) The circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of seven persons at Burnfoot, County Donegal on 23 May 1998 and the investigation relating thereto;</P>
    <P>(<i>j</i>) The effectiveness of the Garda Síochána Complaints inquiry process <i>vis-à-vis</i> the complaints made by Frank McBrearty Snr. and his family between 1997 and 2001;</P>
    <P>and to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters;</P>
    <P>and further resolves that&ndash;</P>
    <P>(I) the tribunal shall report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on an interim basis not later than four months from the date of establishment of the tribunal and also as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the tribunal on the following matters:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the number of parties then represented before the tribunal,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) the progress which will then have been made in the hearings and work of the tribunal,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) the likely duration (so far that may then be capable of being estimated) of the proceedings of the tribunal,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report (including any matters relating to its terms of reference),</P>
    <P>(II) the inquiry shall be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at <Col N="929" /> the earliest possible date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it;</P>
    <P>(III) all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the tribunal should, as far as it is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals;</P>
    <P>(IV) the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall within 14 days of receipt of any report from the tribunal either apply to the High Court for directions regarding publication of the report or arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to enable the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to examine the matters set out in the proposed terms of reference. I thank Members of the House for agreeing to deal with this matter before the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has served this country exceptionally well from the foundation of the State and the majority of members, including those based in Donegal, have done so in a professional way and with the greatest of integrity. This State owes a great deal to the Garda Síochána, which has stood as a bulwark of democracy, often in the most difficult of circumstances. Members of the Garda Síochána have been called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice in the service of the public. Despite the gravity of the matters we are discussing today we should not lose sight of that fact.</P>
    <P>In our discussions today, I am constrained in what I can say regarding aspects of the terms of reference because, as the House is aware a number of court proceedings remain to be dealt with and I do not wish to say anything which might affect those proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the early hours of 14 October 1996, the body of Mr. Richard Barron was found on a roadside in Raphoe, County Donegal. Once again I express my deepest sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Barron and express my particular regret that this case has not yet been brought to finality, despite the passage of time and intensive Garda investigations. The Garda investigation is ongoing. The finding of the remains of the late Mr. Barron set in train a chain of events which have led to today's draft resolution being laid before the House.</P>
    <P>I do not intend nor would it be appropriate for me to outline the details of the Garda investigations, the details of criminal proceedings, the details of civil proceedings, the details of disciplinary proceedings or the details of complaints made to the Garda Complaints Board. It is enough that I say that all of the papers held by various bodies were examined, at my request, by Mr. Shane Murphy, SC, who was nominated to me for appointment by the Chairman of the Bar Council, and following his examination, reported that &ldquo;a Tribunal of Inquiry represents the only comprehensive method of inquiry to resolve out<Col N="930" /> standing issues of fundamental public importance&rdquo;. I and the Government are grateful to Mr. Murphy for his work which will be of assistance to the tribunal in its work. I also again thank Judge Frederick Morris who has agreed to chair this tribunal.</P>
    <P>When dealing with parliamentary questions or motions in the Dáil on alleged misconduct by gardaí in Donegal, I have consistently stated that it is a matter of great concern that individual members of the Garda Síochána might be implicated in wrongdoing. It is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrongdoing by members is investigated thoroughly and, if well founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated. I have consistently pointed out that individuals have a constitutional right to the protection of their good name and a fair trial. An integral part of our justice system is the presumption of innocence and the right to due process and I would not be party to any attempt to breach those rights by arbitrarily condemning individuals or trying to prejudge the outcome of proceedings.</P>
    <P>I have not been against the principle of a public inquiry but establishing a tribunal of inquiry is not something to be undertaken lightly. On 7 February 2001, in response to a parliamentary question, I made it clear that I had an open mind as regards setting up a tribunal. I stressed that I wanted to see the truth of this matter determined. I said that I wanted to see public confidence in the Garda restored. However, the question I posed then went to the heart of the problem, how do we do this in an open and transparent way without interfering with potential civil and criminal proceedings? I also said at that time that I could understand the point that the completion of individual inquiries could still leave a concern that the bigger picture had not been addressed or that it had not been addressed in a way that deals with the issue of public confidence. I said I was of the view that the nature of the Donegal problem is such that it requires some form of comprehensive review that will examine and report on all aspects of the matter.</P>
    <P>I also said on that date that the current arrangements for dealing with complaints are not satisfactory and need to be revised. I said I was looking at the possible establishment of new processes which would not only deal with complaints against individual members but would address wider issues of the type raised by the occurrences in Donegal. I made it clear that I had not ruled out the option of a public inquiry but I was not convinced at that time that it would necessarily be the best way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>On 23 May 2001, I again referred to the problem of possible prejudice to criminal proceedings and advised Deputies that I was seeking the advice of the Attorney General. His advice confirmed that holding such an inquiry at that time could prejudice the civil and criminal proceedings which had been instituted as a result of the alleged misconduct and that, on the basis of the <Col N="931" /> information then to hand, the best course was to let the criminal and civil proceedings run their course. If matters were not fully ventilated during those proceedings, then a tribunal of inquiry could be set up.</P>
    <P>However, neither the criminal nor civil proceedings advanced very quickly and there was real concern, which I shared, over the length of time it was taking to bring the various inquiries and proceedings to finality. In addition, the decision of Mr. McBrearty and his associates to withdraw from the Garda Complaints Board a number of complaints they had made was a cause of concern. It is a matter of great concern to me that individual members of the Garda Síochána have been implicated in wrongdoing. In this regard, my guiding principle has been that it is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrongdoing is investigated thoroughly and appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings taken.</P>
    <P>I also want to see public confidence restored in the Garda, in so far as it has been adversely affected by the matter. We have an excellent police service. Let us be clear about that. The majority of men and women of the Garda Síochána daily carry out their job in the most exemplary manner. We should not forget this.</P>
    <P>When we debated this matter last November, I made the point that this is a complex matter. I stated that the law which provides for due process cannot be shaped or moulded to fit the mood of the time. Rights must be respected. Due process must be protected. These are the fundamental principles which are the foundation of our legal system.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry Acts, as amended by the Bill I introduced, provide the necessary mechanism to address these concerns. It is now a matter for both Houses of the Oireachtas to decide on the tribunal's remit, safe in the knowledge that the tribunal will be able to do the job it is called upon to do. I am absolutely convinced that to have tried to set up a tribunal without fully teasing out the very complex issues posed by the interplay of criminal trials, civil proceedings and the capacity of a tribunal to effectively operate would have resulted in a legal quagmire.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the proposed terms of reference which are both definite, as required by the legislation, and comprehensive. They include: the making of extortion and hoax telephone calls; the investigations in relation to the death of Mr. Barron; allegations of harassment of the McBrearty family; complaints that some gardaí in County Donegal may have been involved in hoax explosives and bomb-making equipment finds; the circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of Frank McBrearty junior; allegations relating to the Garda investigation of an arson attack on property situated on the site of the telecommunications mast at Ardara, County Donegal; allegations that two senior members of the Garda Síochána may have acted with impropriety; and <Col N="932" /> the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána complaints inquiry process<i> vis-à-vis</i> the complaints made by Frank McBrearty senior and his family between 1997 and 2001.</P>
    <P>I have already explained why I do not want to go into too much detail on the actual terms of reference. I urge other speakers to be careful when making their contributions on the issue. There are however one or two points I wish to make. The terms of reference are specific but they are carefully drafted to ensure that the tribunal of inquiry is not restricted in the scope of its inquiries. Furthermore, while the primary purpose of establishing the tribunal is to get at the truth, we must also look to the future. We must not only establish if something went wrong, but why it went wrong and what can be done in the future to prevent it happening again. For that reason, I emphasise the power of the tribunal to make recommendations as it sees fit. The recommendations of the tribunal may be of particular value in maintaining public confidence in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is asked to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I think it appropriate that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be the person to determine, in the first instance, whether the report contains material that might pose a threat of prejudice to criminal proceedings, making it prudent to refer the report to the courts for a direction regarding publication.</P>
    <P>Section (I) provides that the tribunal shall report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on an interim basis, not later than four months from the date of establishment of the tribunal and also as soon as may be after the tenth day of any oral hearings of the tribunal on the following matters: the number of parties then represented before the tribunal; the progress which will then have been made in the hearings and work of the tribunal; the likely duration, so far as that may then be capable of being estimated, of the proceedings of the tribunal; and any other matters that the tribunal considers should be drawn to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas at the time of the report, including any matters relating to its terms of reference. This is a standard provision and need not detain us.</P>
    <P>Section (II) provides that the inquiry shall be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest possible date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it. Section (III) provides that all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the tribunal should, as far as it is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals. Section (IV) provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall on receipt of any report from the tribunal either apply to the High Court for directions regarding publication of the report or arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The allegations that have given rise to this res<Col N="933" /> olution are matters of great public concern. We need to establish, once and for all, what happened in Donegal and to determine the truth of these allegations. I believe that the tribunal, as provided for in this resolution, will be able to effectively discharge this obligation without prejudicing various criminal proceedings which have already been instituted in relation to the alleged misconduct. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) The manner in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities carried out functional and statutory responsibilities in respect of the matters referred to in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>j</i>)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Should the Minister adopt amendment No. <i>a1</i>, it should then conclude &ldquo;in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>k</i>)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome this motion to provide terms of reference for a tribunal of inquiry to investigate matters of alleged Garda misconduct in the Donegal area. This motion should have been brought before the House by the Minister, and should have had support from the Government benches, at least three years ago. The Minister referred to the death of the late Richie Barron in 1996. He, as Members of the House have done on other occasions, expressed concern and condolences to the members of Mr. Barron's family. The family has been left in a position where the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Barron's death have been confused and produced no final result. Serious question marks stand over the validity of steps taken by members of the Garda Síochána. The McBrearty family has found that the Minister failed to take seriously allegations of Garda misconduct made by them. The Minister constantly obstructed and refused to agree to the type of tribunal that is now being proposed. I welcome that we have reached this stage, but I regret that we did not reach it a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of previous debates in this House, it has been emphasised by Opposition Members that we have the greatest debt to pay to, and respect for, the vast majority of the members of the Garda Síochána who undertake their work in an honest and proper fashion. Many gardaí frequently place their lives at risk in the <Col N="934" /> interests of the community. A shadow has been cast over the Garda Síochána by allegations of misconduct, made against a small number of its members, and it has been allowed to lengthen and grow dark by the Minister. He has failed to confront the issues that needed to be addressed as a consequence of an escalating series of allegations of Garda misconduct coming from one particular part of this State.</P>
    <P>The amendments I have tabled deal with two particular issues. I propose to deal with the second amendment first. There are serious issues that the tribunal should look at in the context of the manner in which the Minister, his Department and the Garda authorities dealt with the matters that are now the subject matter of inquiry by this tribunal. As long ago as October 1997, an application was made to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the exhumation of the body of Richie Barron. We know that within days of seeking the exhumation the Garda Síochána changed their minds. Despite the plethora of Dáil questions from the former Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Jim Higgins, Deputy Howlin and me, it was not until October 2001 that the Minister informed the House that these events had occurred. Serious questions need to be asked as to what the Minister and his officials did following October 1997. Did they ask the Garda authorities why they changed their minds? These matters became increasingly fraught. Serious allegations were brought to public notice, complaints were made to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board and court proceedings ground into the dust. Real difficulties arose indicating a credibility problem with the manner in which these issues were being dealt with by members of the Garda Síochána? Did it not occur to the Minister that there was something distinctly odd and unusual about the application for an exhumation order and its sudden withdrawal? This was an issue of great controversy and difficulty.</P>
    <P>That exhumation order, which was reapplied for and resulted in an exhumation in the summer of 2001, clearly provided some answers to some the questions raised. If the exhumation had been carried out in October 1997 it would have shone a light on the investigation being taken by the Garda into the circumstances surrounding the death of Richie Barron. It may have resulted in that investigation progressing in a manner that it has not yet done. It may have also resulted in a different perspective of some members of the Garda Síochana about whom should be investigated, avoided many of the difficulties caused to the McBrearty family and the many allegations that this tribunal may now have to confront.</P>
    <P>There are also issues about the extent to which the Garda authorities kept the Minister and his Department fully informed of the investigations being carried out into allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal. There are issues about the extent to which the current Minister, his departmental officials and the Garda took seriously the <Col N="935" /> allegations of misconduct, as there are about the integrity of the investigations conducted by the Garda Síochána into other members of the force. Those are important issues because, if those investigations were properly conducted, it is unfair to have questions hanging over the gardaí who conducted them. Any difficulties with the investigations, such as gardaí not co-operating with their senior officers, should be part of the tribunal's inquiry.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons the terms of reference brought before us by the Minister are inadequate in not addressing these serious issues, which are of fundamental public importance and must be addressed. This House should receive any recommendations made by the tribunal to ensure that similar difficulties do not arise again. I do not know why the Minister is unwilling to include these matters. I suggest to him that it is in his interests that they form part and parcel of what the tribunal should examine. If it turns out that the Minister was not kept adequately informed of these matters or was badly advised, then, in fairness to him, that should be known. If there are reasons the matters that arose in October 1997 were not pursued, or were pursued without the Minister being given satisfactory answers, then they should form part of the inquiry to bring them into public knowledge. It is usual that a public inquiry into matters of public importance encompasses the extent to which the Department and the Minister responsible were involved. This is particularly so in the context of a Minister whose statutory function, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, covers the Garda Síochána and is responsible to this House for the conduct of its members. Therefore, there is a major flaw in the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The second issue is that, for reasons the Minister has not explained, the allegations made about the prosecution of Frank Shortt are not included. He served more than three years' imprisonment and subsequently, on appeal, the State did not even attempt to uphold the conviction. There are serious questions about why the State took this course of action, and if allegations about Garda misconduct in this case have validity. There is no reason these issues should not be addressed by this tribunal and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins will address another issue we believe should be dealt with by the tribunal, but I am gravely concerned about two provisions in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill, which we debated last week. The first is the provision which allows for the indefinite suppression by the courts of the tribunal's report so that Members of this House may not know of its outcome or of the tribunal's recommendation for many years. My second concern is that the legislation provides for special investigators to be attached to such tribunals but fails to deal with that in the context of other provisions in the relevant Garda Síochána Acts. I am concerned that <Col N="936" /> this inadequacy may result in this tribunal facing huge difficulties in the courts should gardaí, who are brought before it, bring a court challenge. I hope I am wrong but I am concerned that the tribunal legislation and this motion are being processed with undue haste when they should have been dealt with in a more considered way at least three years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is a signal day in that we are at the beginning of the end of a saga that has continued for a long time and caused many questions to be posed and debates sought in this House. It finally resulted in a comprehensive Private Members' debate that was the first time that the Government came to within one vote of defeat, and, if there had been a free vote, an overwhelming majority would have voted in favour of establishing a tribunal of inquiry. The Minister set his face against an inquiry that night and established another trawling exercise, which proved to be useful nevertheless, but today we finally have the terms of reference for a tribunal, which is long overdue, to address matters of enormous importance to this State and our democracy. At last, there will be a proper, thorough investigation into matters that divided communities, caused enormous concerns for individuals and almost wrecked the McBrearty family.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge, as Deputy Shatter did, the position of the members of the Barron family, who lost a loved one, Mr. Richie Barron, and up to now had no adequate explanation of the circumstance in which he died. They deserve to be considered today and I hope the process, which we are putting in train, will bring satisfactory answers to them as well.</P>
      <P>The McBrearty family were virtually put under siege and suffered grievously. I do not intend to spend too many of my ten minutes on the issues to be addressed as we have spent a long time on them already and because they will finally be independently investigated by a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
      <P>The broader picture into which this inquiry fits concerns the issue of accountability. The hallmark of any democracy is transparent public administration, which is the most critical element in defending it. There is much cut and thrust in this House and occasionally political charges are made against Ministers or the Taoiseach, but our job is to ensure that the fundamental pillars, on which our democracy rests, work in a fair, equitable manner, that all citizens are equal under the law and that the State's instruments and agents carry out their duties in a transparent and open fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear we have been extraordinarily well served by the Garda Síochána since the foundation of the State. We have all said repeatedly that we are particularly grateful to them because they were the front line in defending the institutions of the State against a criminal conspiracy to destroy the State over many years. We are moving to more peaceful times, please God, and <Col N="937" /> I hope the foundation stones of the Good Friday Agreement will change the operational structures in which the Garda Síochána operates. Notwithstanding the excellent performance of the Garda on behalf of the State, however, a burden falls on us to hold its members accountable because of the particular powers these Houses divest in them. That duty falls in an onerous way on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has a particular responsibility to maintain the principle of transparency in public administration, but his actions in relation to this matter did not impress me. We are coming to the end of a Dáil term and I do not want to make any rancorous comments on this issue but the Minister should have acted with more alacrity. He should have established the inquiry and brought closure to this matter for people who have suffered for so long.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of inquiries. None of us, apart from the Minister, have seen the Carty report which has been available for a year or more. That was a comprehensive overview of the matter but where is the public information on it? An investigation was carried out by Assistant Commissioner Fachtna Murphy and Superintendent Pat Breheny into a narrow issue but we have not had a report on that. Where is that documentation now? Obviously they will now be subject to the tribunal but all these matters could have been dealt with more effectively on each step along this particular road.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke fine words in his contribution about due process, the rights of individuals and so on but rights were abused in this case and he did not move to ensure the issues involved were addressed effectively, efficiently and expeditiously. The Minister's words, therefore, ring hollow. I hope there is an acceptance now that we need to go further than simply inquiring into past events. We need to be sure about these matters for the future.</P>
    <P>In acknowledging the wonderful work of the Garda Síochána, we also acknowledge that its members work in a different environment in that the structures that were appropriate to the 1920s and the 1930s, or even to the 1970s or 1980s, are not appropriate to the rights and freedoms individual citizens now demand. The structures I proposed in my own Bill, which include a new Garda authority and a Garda ombudsman, are appropriate and I hope the Minister will accept them, even belatedly. I hope also that whatever new Administration comes to office in the coming weeks will have that proposal as part of its progressive agenda.</P>
    <P>I want to make some general points about the terms of reference, one of which relates to the McBrearty family. In every other tribunal of inquiry that primarily affected a group of individuals, those individuals had a particular burden in terms of the inquiry itself and since we have used the phrase &ldquo;the McBrearty affair&rdquo; throughout this entire matter, although it goes well beyond that family, they will also have a particular bur<Col N="938" /> den. I hope the Minister will acknowledge in his response today that a huge financial burden has been placed on the family to date to defend their name and that the role they will have to play in terms of virtually all the terms of reference will be recognised with a proper legal support base, acknowledged by the State, which has been the norm in tribunals to date. I regret the Minister did not see fit to send the draft terms of reference to the McBrearty family's legal team so that they could proffer any observations. That was inappropriate but that action would be appropriate now.</P>
    <P>Morale in the Garda Síochána has been damaged by recent events, the Minister is as attuned to that as myself, and this House must set out to ensure that morale is restored. Not only must there be full confidence of the public in the Garda but gardaí must have full confidence in themselves, their superiors and structures. That can be done now.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence)(Amendment) Bill brought before the House and the many issues we are dealing with in the dying of days of this Dáil, very little time has been provided for consideration of those measures. The terms of reference for this tribunal were faxed to us late the evening before last by the staff in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who are working very hard this week with a range or proposals going through Committee and Report Stages. We were asked to consider them and provide a response by midday yesterday, some few hours later, although we are busy in the interim. They are now before the House and it is unfortunate we did not have more time to be a little more reflective on all this legislation.</P>
    <P>Due to a change in the law, the report on the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence)(Amendment) Bill, which went through the House last week, will not go to the Clerk of the House, which has been the norm since the beef tribunal in that these matters are not instruments of the Executive but of the House, but to the Minister who may then apply to the High Court to stop publication if he sees fit.</P>
    <P>I welcome this day, belatedly, and I look forward to a speedy and comprehensive examination of these issues that have festered for too long. I hope the confidence people have in the Garda Síochána, whose members have served this nation so well, can be fully restored and that we can move on to a brighter day for public administration in this State.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>Like my two colleagues, I welcome this day. It has been a long and tortuous journey but at last the moment of truth has arrived. What we sought three years ago, a tribunal of inquiry into Garda misconduct in Donegal, has been delivered. It is three years too late, however, because it was obvious from the outset that the various Garda inquiries were going nowhere and that the <i>modus operandi</i> of gardaí investigating their Garda friends and colleagues <Col N="939" /> would not deliver anything. We have had a series of inquiries which produced nothing and what we predicted three years ago as being the only viable course of action, a tribunal of inquiry presided over by a judge to deliver the truth, has now come to pass.</P>
      <P>There are a number of glaring omissions in the terms of reference. The first concerns the way in which the matter was dealt with by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, his Department and the Garda. There was a breakdown in communications between the various instruments, agencies and personalities and the Minister, his Department and the Garda. An exhumation order was sought by Inspector Kevin Lennon, but that was subsequently countermanded by Chief Superintendent Denis Fitzpatrick, yet nobody in the Department, let alone the Minister, thought it worth his or her while querying why the order, first, had been sought and, second, countermanded. Had that been done at the time, it might have led to establishing exactly what was going on.</P>
      <P>The quality of the Garda inquiries also needs to be examined in terms of how serious, efficient and competent they were and why none of them led anywhere? Rather than suspending people on pay, gardaí were transferred, in some cases on promotion, and some to high profile positions, appearing on television once a week dealing with the issue of road traffic and road safety. That rather bizarre situation also needs to be examined. It is bizarre that people who were under investigation for Garda misconduct in Donegal were transferred and, in some cases, rewarded and promoted, while no definitive conclusion was arrived at in relation to how they carried on their duties.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied there is within the Garda Síochána a comprehension of the seriousness of this matter. For example, last Friday Bernard Conlon was convicted in court in Sligo. He got a hefty jail sentence. It was said in court by a series of witnesses that his house was more like a Garda station than a private dwelling because of the degree of interaction and conspiracy between the gardaí and himself. He said the gardaí used to refer to him as &ldquo;Detective Garda Conlon&rdquo;, yet the two gardaí who were named in court have still not been charged or brought before the courts. Why not?</P>
      <P>In relation to this Donegal saga, not a single member of the Garda Síochána is the subject of a charge into the manner in which they conducted their affairs. The only garda before the courts at present is Detective Garda John White for the illegal possession of a firearm, which has nothing to do with any of the matters that are the subject of the terms of reference before the House. There is still not, within the Garda Síochána at senior level, a degree of appreciation of the need to be upfront, frank, honest, transparent, effective and to act expeditiously when people have obviously abused their positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" />There is an omission in this motion, in that, as well as the Frank Shortt case the Gallagher family of St. Johnston has not been included. When the Labour Party and other Opposition parties brought forward their motion to set up a tribunal of inquiry last November, I highlighted the Gallagher case. I mentioned it again last week when a motion was before the House to set up the tribunal of inquiry. The Gallagher family has the same degree of grievance as the Divers family, the Shortt family or the McBrearty family. The Gallagher family is a law abiding family with deep roots in Donegal, a reputation for being upholders of law and order, good citizens, business people, farmers and some of its members have been previously in the Garda Síochána, yet for some reason some of its members were the victims of a conspiracy where wrong information was given to the gardaí about the alleged presence of arms or explosives on their land. I have no problem with the gardaí investigating tip-offs, but in their case, this was a red herring. It was not a tip-off given in good faith. The <i>modus operandi </i>of the gardaí in this case led to the devastation of the Gallagher family. The family's farm was surrounded; they were literally besieged. They were not allowed out even to go to the shop. There was a constant presence of a helicopter over the farm. Their sheep were driven into barbed wire fences with the result that sheep and lambs were lost. They were ostracised by the people in the neighbourhood. They lost their machinery contracting business and no apology has been forthcoming. That Gallagher family is as entitled as the McBrearty, the Divers and the Shortt families or anybody else concerned to be included in the terms of reference of this tribunal.</P>
    <P>Another serious issue that should be investigated, which I brought to the attention of the Minister, by way of a parliamentary question, are allegations that conversations between solicitors and their clients and between persons in custody and their visitors may have been electronically listened to at Letterkenny Garda station. My information is that a person with the necessary technical experience and ability was brought from Dublin specifically to do this job. My information, which comes from a member of the Garda Síochána, is that this did happen. That is a very serious breach of ethical and professional conduct in addition to civil rights. I want that matter investigated within the terms of reference of the tribunal and I want the Minister to address it when replying to these contributions. I want an assurance that these allegations of the bugging of conversations at Letterkenny Garda station will be dealt with and thoroughly investigated to ascertain whether there is any veracity to them. My information in this instance has come from a member of the Garda Síochána attached to Letterkenny Garda station.</P>
    <P>I look forward, with Deputy Howlin, to co-operating with the tribunal. I am very disappointed the information we gave to Fachtna Murphy and to Chief Superintendent Pat <Col N="941" /> Breheny has not been expeditiously acted upon. We will have no hesitation in appearing before the tribunal and telling all that we know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief statement. When this matter was dealt with in the Dáil last week I raised the issue of information I had received regarding a murder case and stated that I did not want to prejudge or prejudice any trial. I have since forwarded the information directly to the Minister and have seen a copy of a reply he gave to my colleague, Deputy Shatter, regarding the terms of reference for the forthcoming tribunal. In the letter I sent to the Minister when forwarding that file, I asked that when establishing the terms of reference of the tribunal that he consider allowing the tribunal to investigate senior gardaí involved in the investigation of the McBrearty affair and transferred to other Garda districts outside Donegal who were involved in further murder investigations. Unfortunately, the Minister's reply does not suggest that the terms of reference of the tribunal will allow those investigations to take place.</P>
      <P>If this case goes to court, the people involved will feel they have not been given a fair opportunity because of the question marks over senior gardaí who were involved in the McBrearty case. If that is allowed to continue, there will always be questions regarding the good standing of the Garda Síochána. This tribunal is an opportunity to, once and for all, try to clear the names of the members of the Garda Síochána who were involved in the McBrearty and other cases in the Donegal division. If a number of senior gardaí, who were in Donegal at the time of those investigations, were involved in other cases, a question mark will also hang over those investigations. This is an opportunity to have the matter resolved. Will the Minister reconsider the requests I have made? I do not want a witch hunt which includes every Garda in the force. There are a number of questions which I have raised specifically with the Minister. Will the Minister reconsider his reply to Deputy Shatter and broaden the terms of reference to allow the case of which I speak to be investigated? As the Minister is aware, some of the information has been of concern to me. This is an opportunity to clear up the whole matter once and for all and to reinforce our necessary respect for the Garda Síochána. I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision.</P>

I have no intention of turning this tribunal into a political football. It is about what happened in Donegal. If the tribunal wants answers from me about any point I will gladly provide them. The terms of reference as suggested by Mr. Shane Murphy SC, who reviewed all the relevant documentation, did not include any proposal along the lines of those now being put forward by the Opposition. In any event the proposed resolution as suggested by me and in particular the instruction to make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit in relation to these matters gives the tribunal the scope to address, if it wishes, any issue which contributed to or failed to address Garda misconduct found to have taken place in Donegal.</P>
      <P>I will not be party to any proposal directing the tribunal to look for fire where there is no smoke simply because the Opposition is desperate to gain political advantage. There are far more serious issues for the tribunal to focus on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference are specific but they are carefully drafted to ensure that the tribunal of inquiry is not restricted in the scope of its inquiries. Furthermore, while the primary purpose of establishing the inquiry is to get at the truth, we must also look to the future. We must not only establish whether something went wrong but why it went wrong and what can be done in the future to prevent it from happening again. For that reason I emphasise the power of the tribunal to make recommendations as it sees fit. The tribunal is asked to report to the Minister <Col N="943" /> for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is appropriate that the Minister be the person to determine, in the first instance, whether the report contains material that might pose a threat of prejudice to criminal proceedings, making it prudent to refer the report to the courts for direction regarding publication.</P>
      <P>The allegations that have given rise to this resolution are matters of great public concern. We need to establish what happened in Donegal and to determine the truth of the allegation. The tribunal provided for in this resolution will be able to discharge this obligation effectively without prejudicing the various criminal proceedings which have already been instituted in relation to the alleged misconduct. I have take advice from Mr. Shane Murphy SC on the Shortt case. Mr. Murphy had advised that my Department should monitor proceedings in the Court of Criminal Appeal, before which this case is due in May. I accept his advice that at this stage the case should not be referred to a tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, could the Minister clarify his last point? Mr. Shortt brought this appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the State indicated that it was not now opposing the appeal. The Minister should clarify the State's position. If there is some incidental matter left to be dealt with at the Court of Criminal Appeal, that is no reason for not including the Shortt case. Perhaps the Minister could indicate whether it is his intention that the matter be included following completion of the matters in court? To be fair to Mr. Shortt that matter should be clarified to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, I have taken advice from Mr. Murphy in this matter and I accept his advice. As regards what happens afterwards, it all depends. His advice has been to monitor proceedings of the court.</P>
      <P>The matter of exhumation will arise in connection with term of reference (b). A specific reference is therefore unnecessary. I have already dealt with the issue in the House on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter commented on section 3 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, which provides for the recipient of the report of the tribunal to apply to the High Court for directions about publication. This applies if the Minister considers that publication might prejudice criminal proceedings. On application the High Court may direct that some or all of the report not be published and can hear on this subject the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the person who is the subject of criminal proceedings. It is in the hands of the court. The Minister cannot suppress the report as Deputy Shatter has alleged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in having section 2 of the Bill provide for the hearing of evidence in private if the report could be published. The report will contain the evidence heard in private, or at least a summary of it, and the tribunal's findings on that evidence. Thus, in some circumstances, it <Col N="944" /> could have an even greater potential to prejudice criminal proceedings than would be the case if the evidence in question had originally been heard in public.</P>
    <P>The Sergeant White situation, which relates to the circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of seven persons at Burnfoot, County Donegal, on 23 May 1998 and the investigation relating thereto, is covered. The tribunal is free to investigate the case of the Gallagher family under point (e) &ndash; allegations relating to hoax explosives &ndash; and possibly under other headings. However, this case has not been identified as being central to the main allegations of Garda misconduct. The question of bugging may be investigated under (b), which pertains to the investigations regarding the death of Mr. Barron. I will seek a report from the Garda Síochána about the matter raised by Deputy Reynolds but without a detailed review, as was carried out in the Donegal matter, I could not contemplate its inclusion in terms of reference at this time.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate there has been a futile pursuit of a political smoking gun. There is no smoke because there is no fire.</P>

      <P>During the discussion of this matter in the Seanad last Friday the Minister for Education and Science made a number of incorrect statements regarding the process to date. I make one final plea to him to deal satisfactorily with the matter of those persons who were abused in day schools, particularly those concerned in my constituency. Officials from his Department have been in contact with them and the Minister met a deputation. His predecessor was also in touch with them for a long period. This is the Minister's final opportunity to address this issue in a satisfactory manner. I do not accept that either the Minister or his Department fully understand what is involved or the level of unfairness demonstrated in the Bill. I ask him to make a positive commitment in the next half hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Deputy Flanagan's comments. This is the last opportunity for the Minister to bring closure on this very difficult issue to the people currently excluded from the terms of the Bill. It is three years ago this month since the Taoiseach offered an apology on behalf of the Irish people to all who were abused in institutions <Col N="950" /> as children. He did not distinguish between those who were in residential institutions and those who were in day schools. It is disingenuous in the extreme for the Minister to suggest that people who were in day schools and suffered abuse at the hands of people who were paid by the State to work in institutions it regulated and inspected should be excluded from the compensation scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, many of them paid an initial visit to the commission and conveyed their concerns about the fact that, on the one hand, the commission is carrying out the investigation and listening to people's stories while, on the other, there is a selective compensation scheme. The people currently excluded from the terms of the Bill made it clear to Ms Justice Laffoy that they are not prepared to participate in the commission while the Minister continues to deny them the right of redress. If the Taoiseach's apology is to mean anything to people who were sexually abused in day schools, the Minister must meet his serious moral obligation to include them in the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has expressed concern about opening floodgates. This was recognised in the proposal he received which would allow at least those former day pupils who were abused and have been involved in court cases in which convictions were secured against the perpetrators to benefit from the compensation scheme. There is no justification for excluding them. One must bear in mind that, in addition to the extreme damage, hurt and trauma they experienced as a result of suffering abuse as children, these people have also been through the very difficult process of a criminal court case where they have shown the bravery and strength to give evidence which in many cases secured lengthy sentences for the perpetrators. By denying them access to the redress board, the Minister is leaving them no option, but to go through the same harrowing experience again, this time by taking civil cases through the courts.</P>
      <P>This is the Minister's last opportunity to provide justice and fairness to these victims. They have contacted him on several occasions and made numerous pleas. Having given them clear commitments that the Minister would include them in the terms of the Bill, a series of Government backbenchers made the case for doing so on Second Stage. As we approach the end of the process, the Minister has forgotten these people by excluding them and leaving them to their own devices. The refusal of the State to take responsibility renders the Taoiseach's apology meaningless.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to one further matter.</P>

I implore him to reconsider the matter and include these people within the terms of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because the two previous speakers made the case well. The Bill should be inclusive, not exclusive. It is appalling that we are enacting legislation that discriminates against day school pupils who have been sexually abused and does not extend to them the same compensation rights as are being extended to those who were abused in residential institutions. It is extraordinary that it is still not recognised that many of the people concerned have been to hell and back and had damaged relationships in their adult lives as a consequence of their experiences as young people and teenagers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall referred to those who have already been before the courts as witnesses. These people have suffered great trauma, yet they have shown extraordinary courage in providing information to the Garda Síochána, appearing as witnesses before the courts and having to cope with the rigours and stress of cross-examinations conducted by lawyers defending, and acting on the instructions of the people accused and ultimately convicted of their sexual abuse, people who denied their guilt during the court case.</P>
      <P>They have done an enormous public service to the State and I question the extent to which this has been understood. There are people behind bars who otherwise would continue to prey on young people. They have been imprisoned for no other reason than the courage of their previous victims to come forward and cope with the stress of a criminal trial and the 18 month to three year lead in period between complaint first being made to the Garda Síochána and the trial taking place. They should be given the same rights to compensation as victims of abuse in residential institutions. I have no doubt this issue will return to the House after the next election and I hope we are opposite and in a position to deal with it. A gross injustice is being perpetrated by this legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that it will provide compensation rights for the victims of institutional abuse but I deplore the fact that it excludes those who suffered abuse in day schools and who have had the courage to come before the courts to tell their stories. They have contributed to keeping behind bars many people who abused children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the three previous speakers. It has been inferred, if not attributed directly to the Minister, that the State's reluctance on this issue is cost driven. Will the Minister comment in that context on the extension of the statute of limitations and the fact that many victims are pursuing the State anyway through the courts for compensation? The <i>raison d'être</i> of this legislation apart from compensating victims, is to do so in a non-adversarial and out of court fashion. Does the Minister accept that even from a financial point of view if he were to extend the scope of the Bill to people who were day pupils and who have sexual abuse cases before the courts, limited though that might be, it would go some way towards resolving the one significant outstanding issue raised in the legislation. Otherwise that issue will divide the House if the Minister does not yield at this late stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the last opportunity to speak. It is the eleventh hour and notwithstanding the technical nature of the amendment there are outstanding issues on which the Minister should comment.</P>
      <P>Is it not the case in respect of the women who worked in a Magdalene laundry that we now have two categories of women who worked side by side in those laundries? One of them will now be entitled to compensation by virtue of the fact that she came from an industrial school to a Magdalene laundry while some unfortunate woman who was incarcerated &ndash; and that is the reality &ndash; in a laundry for being pregnant out of wedlock is not entitled to compensation.</P>
      <P>Surely we are on very thin legal ice. I do not claim to be a legal expert but this seems a rather invidious distinction to draw, that if a woman came from an industrial school to a Magdalene laundry she is entitled to compensation for abuse suffered, while if a woman was incarcerated in such a laundry for being pregnant out of wedlock but had not been in an industrial school she is not entitled to compensation.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also comment on day students, where we now have a somewhat similar situation to that which pertained in the Magdalene laundry. Of two students who sat side by side in a school, if one went home in the evening while the other was resident, one is entitled to compensation. The Schedule lists one particular day school for Traveller children where entitlement is being established. What is the legal advice available to the Department? Will that ring-fencing, that artificial distinction, stand the test of judicial scrutiny? It appears to me to be very unfair and I ask the Minister to consider those issues at this late stage. Apart from our moral obligation to deal inclusively with all victims, even from a financial point of view this is a false economy of the Minister's.</P>

      <P>In fairness, I have to rule on this. The amendment provides that reference to a Minister of State be deleted. I let the first speaker off so I had to let the others off but we cannot have a general discussion on this amendment. Does Deputy Enright want to address the amendment?</P>

      <P>Regarding the amendment, whether it is a Minister or Minister of State involved, I am unhappy because what the Minister is deciding here is very wrong. I spent a great deal of time on Second and Committee Stages on this issue, when I made an appeal to the Minister similar to the one which Deputy Creed has made. We must have redress for people who attended day schools and primary schools. I refer to those who suffered sexual abuse, as physical abuse is more difficult to establish. If people were sexually abused in primary or post-primary schools they should be entitled to compensation.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the Bill. I have said all this in the Seanad. I stepped ahead of the commission, which is looking at the situation, and established a specific group. The Residential Institutions Redress Bill is for people who were in residential institutions and for whom the State had a clear and definite responsibility. There is no point in going back over all the issues involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the suffering of those to whom Deputies have referred. I said clearly that this is not the end but relates to one group which could be specified very clearly. As we saw during <Col N="954" /> debates on the Bill it was not easy to specify it clearly and people have raised questions about what I have done already and suggested there may be challenges. This Bill will at least do something specific for people who were in a tight corner as the State had taken them away and locked them up and their parents were not involved  &ndash; the Kennedy report gave a full account of the situation. In that sense this is a clear and important group.</P>
    <P>There are other groups and in the first instance I thought it might be a good idea to include the victims of those who had at least been convicted in the courts. However, the more I looked into this the more complications arose because of problems with equity and with people who could not maintain a court case because people who could give evidence were not available. This is a much wider issue and should now be examined by whoever is in my position after the election &ndash; there is no question about that. In the meantime the commission will look at this issue and may be able to give some guidance in its interim or full report. It is looking very widely at this matter and one of its functions is to recommend how issues of past abuse can be addressed in the interests of the victims. Strictly speaking, I should have waited for that, but Deputies are familiar with the reasons the Government did not want to wait. I wanted to specify a particular group&mdash;</P>

I would have had to go back to Cabinet and to the Attorney General and other legal advisers. That will have to be done after the passage of this Bill, which is being expedited to do something for a specific group. We have discussed the Magdalene institutions on previous occasions, but I wish to make clear again that those for whom the State was responsible, who entered such institutions because the State was responsible for their welfare, comprise a distinct group. This Bill is the first important and major step in this process and should be welcomed as such. It has been alleged that I am wrong in what I am doing, but I do not believe I am as this is a right and good measure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend to the House the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, which addresses important issues relating to the registration of medical practitioners. It represents a <Col N="957" /> first step in the ongoing programme of updating and revising the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. The public health service is dependent, above all else, on the staff who provide a high quality service week in week out. The 1978 Act regulated the practice of medicine in Ireland through the registration of medical practitioners, to ensure that the service had access to doctors of the highest quality and that the interests of patients were paramount. The Medical Council, which was established under the Act, is the statutory authority that oversees the registration and regulation of doctors and evaluates the suitability of medical education and training provided by bodies in the State. The council's constitution and additional functions are outlined in detail in the Act.</P>
    <P>Almost 25 years have passed since the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, was enacted. The provision of health services in Ireland and throughout the world has moved on considerably in the intervening period. The need for doctors to keep abreast of new developments, the rights of patients to be informed about their treatment and public expectations have greatly increased since 1978. It has been recognised for some time that the Act no longer meets the needs of a modern health service and, in this context, the need for a comprehensive review, aimed at developing legislation to meet current and future requirements, was acknowledged. The Department of Health and Children has undertaken a thorough review of the Act in the past year, involving widespread consultation with the key stakeholders in the health service: patients, doctors, the Medical Council and health service agencies. The message from those consulted is that the 1978 Act needs to be updated. My Department has used the information in the submissions to prepare a structure for the development of the draft heads of a new medical practitioners Bill, to be published in the autumn.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I wish to inform the House that new legislation to provide for the regulation of nursing and midwifery is under preparation and the draft heads of a Bill to govern the regulation of the professions allied to medicine is at an advanced stage. When passed, these Bills and the Bill to update the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, will provide a legislative framework for the regulation of the health professionals and will ensure the highest level of competence among those who provide our health services. The national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for You, launched by the Minister for Health and Children in November 2001, contained a commitment to undertake an independent audit of functions and structures in the health system.</P>
    <P>The results of the audit of the Medical Council, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board will have to be taken into account in drafting the heads of the new Bill. The Minister launched the national task force on medical staffing last year to examine the implementation of the medical manpower forum report <Col N="958" /> and the Hanley report on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and provide an overview of medical education and training. The work of the task force will have significant implications across the public health service. Any recommended changes will affect hospital doctors, general practitioners, nurses, hospital and health board managers, the training bodies, the Medical Council and, in the final analysis, the patient. It is for the purpose of delivering better, safer and higher quality health services for the patient that the Government has adopted this integrated approach.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council has also brought forward a number of proposals for change. The council wants to improve its efficiency and delivery of services. It has also undertaken an exercise to set out a scheme of competence assurance for doctors. The proposed scheme will encompass continuous medical education, continuous professional development and clinical audit and peer review. The purpose of competence assurance is to ensure that doctors maintain the highest levels of competence and awareness of developments in their field of expertise.</P>
    <P>The new Act will also address issues surrounding the area of fitness to practise procedures. The streamlining of procedures and the appropriateness of the committee structures will be examined. The provision of relevant information to the Minister, employers and the public will be provided for.</P>
    <P>There are a number of priority issues that cannot wait until a new Act is passed and which must be addressed urgently to avoid any potential disruption to service delivery. It is for this reason that I present this Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, to the House today.</P>
    <P>The most important of the amendments being proposed today is the amendment of section 27(2) of the current Act. We have, at present. approximately 3,600 non-consultant hospital doctors employed in the health service. Of this number approximately 1,600 are temporary registered doctors who come from outside the European Union. These doctors provide essential services in our hospitals and in some rural areas these doctors constitute more than 60% of the non-consultant hospital doctors cohort. They may have lived and worked here for extended periods and may, in some cases, have taken out Irish citizenship. I wish to publicly acknowledge the quality and quantity of their contribution to the Irish public health service. We owe these doctors our gratitude and should value their expertise and experience.</P>
    <P>As many of these doctors joined the Irish health service before the implementation of the temporary registration assessment scheme they have not sat the temporary registration assessment scheme exam. This has affected their ability to move from the temporary register to the permanent register. Under the 1978 Act, only qualifications and training can be taken into account when considering applications for the permanent <Col N="959" /> register. The current legislation, whilst recognising the training element, does not permit the Medical Council to give due regard to the relevant experience gained while working in the public health service by doctors applying for permanent registration despite the fact that some temporary registered doctors can have spent up to seven years working in the Irish public health service. At the same time, graduates of Irish medical schools who have completed just one year of postgraduate internship can apply for permanent registration.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that employers and regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions are only too happy to recruit and permanently register these doctors based on the experience they have gained while employed in the Irish health service. At a time when the Irish public hospital system is undertaking extensive recruitment initiatives to ensure that all medical posts are filled we must ensure that every effort is made to retain the complement of doctors currently within our hospital service. Many of these temporary registered doctors are reaching the end of the period of temporary registration and may be lost to the Irish health service if we do not take action.</P>
    <P>In addition, changes in European Union law and a recent ruling of the European Court of Justice require us to take account of relevant experience gained within the EU when assessing applications from EU citizens for permanent registration.</P>
    <P>The resultant benefits will mean that fewer recruitment and retention difficulties will be experienced by hospitals in relation to non-consultant hospital doctors. The temporary registration period for some doctors, especially those from non-EU countries, which lasts a maximum of seven years, will begin to expire from next June onwards thus requiring the doctors concerned to leave the Irish public health service system and potentially causing some hospitals to experience difficulties in securing their required number of junior doctors. This Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, will ensure that doctors who may otherwise have had to leave the country will be able to remain here and to apply for permanent registration. This will result in continuity of staffing and the maintenance of service delivery in the public health service, while at the same time tackling certain inequities with regard to access to permanent registration on the register of medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>We must also look to address anomalies within the current Act which prevent EU citizens who have graduated from European medical schools from completing their internships in Ireland. In 1978 it was not envisaged that there would be any interest from amongst EU citizens for internships in Ireland. The 1978 Act, therefore, restricted internship, or as it was called at the time &ldquo;provisional registration&rdquo;, to graduates of Irish medical schools.</P>
    <P>Nowadays more and more Irish students have <Col N="960" /> decided to study medicine abroad within the EU. Many of these students would wish to return to Ireland for the purpose of completing their internship in an Irish hospital. In order to facilitate these and other EU citizens we propose to take the necessary steps to amend the current legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has also been requested to address how the current Act might be amended to provide for both internship and temporary training to be carried out in a variety of health care settings. At present such training is restricted to training in the acute hospital setting. This requirement has the impact of restricting both the location and nature of training which can be undertaken and reduces the ability of the doctor in training to gain the widest possible experience. It is now accepted that there are a number of health care settings, such as community-based services and general practice, in which a doctor in training could and should gain very valuable experience.</P>
    <P>It has also been brought to the Minister's attention that there is a requirement, in certain circumstances, for an appropriate form of temporary registration to be available where a doctor is in this country on a short-term basis, for example to demonstrate his or her skills to medical colleagues or to provide professional support at a sporting event.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, is concerned to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place in certain areas of health care, such as cosmetic surgery for example, where doctors may be entering the jurisdiction for short periods in order to carry out such procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Which did the Minister say, cosmetic surgery or cosmetic policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Cosmetic surgery. The Deputy does not need it.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of some concern to the Minister and it is our intention to deal with it in some detail in the comprehensive Bill to be brought forward later this year. It is accepted, however, that some urgent steps must be taken at this time and these are addressed in the amending Bill.</P>
      <P>The main proposal in the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, is to allow validated professional experience to be taken into account in the assessment of applications for permanent registration on the Register of Medical Practitioners. Under current legislation. only training and qualifications can be acknowledged when considering such applications. This Bill will enable the Medical Council to make rules regarding applications for permanent registration in which relevant, validated experience will be taken into account as well as, or instead of, prescribed courses of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amending Bill will now allow doctors in training under intern registration and temporary registration to work in a variety of health care settings, to be specified by the Medical Council, <Col N="961" /> whereas the current legislation confines these doctors to the acute hospital sector. The council will be enabled to make rules to regulate they type of health care setting where such training can be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for any EU citizen who has obtained a primary medical degree within the EU to be granted internship registration in Ireland. At present only graduates of Irish Universities can undertake their internship registration in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the indefinite extension of temporary registration for a doctor who has made application for permanent registration. The period of temporary registration, in this instance, is extended until such time as a final decision is made with regard to the doctor's application for permanent registration. The Bill also provides for the Medical Council to make rules regarding temporary registration for doctors entering the jurisdiction to work for short periods. The council will also be enabled to make rules regarding those who employ or contract the services of such doctors.</P>
    <P>The staffing requirements of hospitals and the deployment of staff within hospitals is primarily a matter for local management having regard to the services which hospitals are expected to provide. Particular staffing difficulties have been faced by the health services in recent years across a wide range of areas, particularly in the medical, paramedical and nursing areas.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children, in conjunction with the Health Service Employers Agency, assists at national level with the development of a policy framework which will enable employers to identify vacancies, to locate, recruit and train suitable candidates for the vacant posts, and to retain the staff in whom they have invested significant time and resources.</P>
    <P>In the health strategy, under the Action Plan for People Management, the Government set out its plan for the health service to become an employer of choice. In this regard the strategy commits the Government to investment in training and education for health sector staff; implementation of best practices in employment policies and procedures; building and enhancing tile management function; improving the quality of working life for our health service staff; developing performance management; promoting improved industrial relations in the health sector; and developing the partnership approach further. Work on the action plan is already under way and is being undertaken in the context of partnership and consultation. This amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act represents yet another measure to improve the working arrangements for non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>An intensive series of negotiations held in 2000 under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission concluded with agreement on all of the major concerns of non-consultant hospital doctors. The proposals for settlement included a very significant improvement in the overtime <Col N="962" /> rates paid to non-consultant hospital doctors. In addition a senior manager has been appointed in each major hospital with specific responsibility to manage non-consultant hospital doctor hours. A concerted effort has been made to improve working conditions and to reduce non-consultant hospital doctor working hours with particular attention to long periods of continuous duty.</P>
    <P>Significant increases in overtime rates have been implemented. A substantial training programme has been put in place. New procedures have been introduced to deal with NCHD grievances at local level. Relocation expenses are also being paid to NCHDs who have to move residence as part of formal rotation schemes. A programme of refurbishment of medical residences is well advanced. These enhanced terms and conditions are summarised in the Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors Agreement, 2000, and will cost in excess of &euro;100 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>In relation to non-consultant hospital doctors staffing, health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the filling of NCHD posts. Current occupancy levels are in excess of 98% and initiatives are ongoing to ensure that vacancies are kept to a minimum. Hospitals are exploring different options in an effort to ensure that all medical posts are filled. With the full co-operation of all concerned and a commitment to making the best use of available resources, occupancy levels will be optimised.</P>
    <P>On a broader front, the issues relating to the medical staffing of hospitals were addressed by the medical manpower forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors, the forum sought to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to look at the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to reducing the number who leave medicine.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues which affect NCHDs' working conditions cannot be resolved immediately. Among these are the twin issues of working hours and the restructuring of the medical career hierarchy. The working hours of NCHDs have been the subject of negotiations at European level in the context of the proposed extension of the 1993 EU Directive on Working Time to doctors in training. In this context and to provide for a smooth transition and the least possible impact on service delivery, I am glad to note that EU agreement was reached on a formula that provided for a nine year transition period to apply the directive to junior doctors. The directive requires each member state to reduce the working hours of doctors in training to more acceptable, and safer, levels within a specified, legally binding timeframe. Subsequently a major study of NCHD working hours was conducted with the Irish Medical Organisation at eight hospitals by <Col N="963" /> PA Management Consultants, called the Hanley report.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the national task force on medical staffing was established by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to prepare and cost an implementation plan for a new approach to hospital services, based on appropriately trained doctors providing patients with the highest quality service. The task force will prepare detailed implementation programmes based on the two key reports already mentioned and published last year: the Hanley report on the phased reduction of the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the report of the medical manpower forum. The implementation programme will be addressed in the context of the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, which was published last November. The key work of the task force will be to oversee the implementation of detailed strategies for reducing the working hours of NCHDs, so that a 48 hour working week is achieved by 2009; to address the associated medical staffing needs of the Irish hospital system; to analyse the practicalities and estimate the costs that would arise if a consultant-provided &ndash; rather than consultant-led &ndash; system was in place; and to consider the medical education and training requirements arising from any changes to the current model of delivering services.</P>
    <P>The inaugural meeting of the task force took place on 21 February and the steering group met again on 14 March. The Minister for Health and Children has asked the task force to devise and cost a suitable model of delivery within nine months. I am confident that, with the full co-operation of the profession and with other measures such as the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, we can achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>Every analysis to date comes back to the same key point &ndash; we are over dependent on junior doctors who, while still in training, are required to provide 24-hour, seven day medical care, formally under the supervision of individual consultants. A number of factors affect consultants' ability to be present on site at weekends, evenings and during the night. Patients in turn may have limited access to appropriate levels of senior clinical decision making, with implications for safety of diagnosis and treatment, on the one hand, and efficiency and cost-effectiveness, on the other. As an independent entity, the task force is in a good position to develop a suitable cost-effective model which best meets patient safety and quality concerns, as well as contributing centrally to the two fundamental principles reflected in the title of the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You. It also addresses some of the key national goals of the strategy, which relate to responsive and appropriate care and high performance.</P>
    <P>Public health systems, demographics and lifestyles, technology and expectations are exhibiting an international pattern of unprecedented change <Col N="964" /> and challenge, which urgently demand new methods. In preparing the new strategy, it was necessary to look critically and constructively at service issues such as the length of the working day and how we provide cover over this longer period; the redrawing of professional boundaries; organising care and service delivery around the patient rather than <i>vice versa</i>; and a much more dynamic and committed approach to managing quality. The health service will continue to make the case for additional investment, provided we can work collaboratively in making the necessary reforms to yield improved results.</P>
    <P>The message from the medical profession expressing its willingness to be more flexible, while maintaining admirably high standards under pressure, is very much welcomed by the Government. Where there is a clear willingness to jointly reassess in a fundamental way some of the assumptions attached to the inadequate <i>status quo</i>, the Government's response can also be flexible. By adopting an open approach together to face change and modernisation, implementation of the strategy will ensure the best use of resources, the sharing of best practice across all disciplines and the provision of significant additional funding.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations within the health sector has been a matter of concern and much comment. Both health service unions and management can draw many valuable lessons from the comprehensive audit carried out by the Labour Relations Commission into the industrial relations situation within the Irish health service. It provides a unique opportunity for a new departure in relation to how we conduct our business and highlights the need for better communication, more transparency and partnership among all stakeholders. The renewed emphasis on a people-centered approach must be as applicable to staff working within the health services as it is to the ever-growing number of people accessing these services, towards the delivery of high quality health care for all. This approach will be strongly reflected in the forthcoming action plan for people management to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>In addition to the steps already outlined, the Department of Health and Children has been in contact with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs. The purpose of these contacts is to explore ways in which the processing of visas and work permits can be streamlined to assist health service employers with their recruiting drives. In this regard, the possibility of extending the working visa-work authorisation scheme, which already applies to nurses, to other health service staff is being examined by the departmental group. The scheme would provide a more flexible mechanism for regulating the entry of non-EU and non-EEA citizens into Ireland for the purpose of working in the health service. It is hoped to progress this initiative in the very short-term.</P>
    <P>Both health service providers and members of <Col N="965" /> the public would like to have the best quality and range of services available. This is a worthy aspiration, since service demands are triggered largely by issues such as demographic change &ndash; an increasing population that is living for longer &ndash; and the continuous and rapid developments in health technology. It is part of the role of the Minister for Health and Children to measure the real need for additional services, taking account of public expectations as well as the expert view. A second and subsequent demand of that role is to bridge the gap between current provision and what is needed, as speedily and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic and well-documented increase in the provision of funding to the health service over the life of this Government. Gross non-capital expenditure has risen by 129% from 1997 to 2002. This Government is committed to maintaining sufficient support to empower professionals to continually improve the services in our hospitals and in the community in general. On the capital side the high level of investment by the Government will continue over the period of the national development plan, demonstrating a considerable increase in capital investment relative, historically, to any previous period. Again, examining the level of capital funding provided over the life of this Government, 2002 boasts a capital funding allocation to the health sector that equals a 260% increase on the 1997 figure.</P>
    <P>The commitment this Government has given to provide the funding required to implement the health strategy has been crucial. There is little point in producing health strategy documents which map out the path to quality health services if we are not committed to following through with the investment, reform and modernisation to make this a reality over a reasonable period of time. I believe that the public demand and deserve the best health services that our economy can now afford and sustain, and initiatives such as this legislative amendment to advance recruitment and retention of requisite staff are among the significant measures to achieve this. Through collaborative work effort and effective change management, the health strategy will ensure the best use of resources in delivering a health service based on quality and fairness for all this country's citizens and its health service staff.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am seeking the co-operation of this House in amending the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to allow for further revised registration arrangements for doctors. Whether originating from Ireland, Europe or beyond, there is no doubt that medical personnel are a major and key resource to the Irish health services, deserving of acknowledgement and support. This amending Bill, in conjunction with the main Bill later this year, will be key factors in ensuring that in five years' time, there should no longer be shortages in those crucial disciplines which are currently holding back the development of much needed services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" />I hereby commend the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2002, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McManus and I facilitated taking this Bill at the request of the Minister because he indicated its urgency as a technical matter in relation to registrations that would run out in July. I do not agree with taking Bills in this manner. To some extent, we are taking in good faith the contents of the Bill and the assurances we have received regarding the technical nature of the Bill and that there are no substantial changes to which the Oireachtas should give detailed consideration. Having facilitated the Minister, I am disappointed that he has not paid us the courtesy of coming into the House but that is not to take from the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, who has already explained to us why he is not here today even though Deputy McManus and I made ourselves available.</P>
      <P>I will return to some of the contents of the Bill and the Minister of State's speech in a moment but I will first make a few points on the Bill. To some extent, a golden opportunity in relation to steps that could be taken to radically change the supply side of Irish medicine is constantly being missed. Irish consumers are not, in the main, complaining about the cost of health care but about inefficiencies and lack of services. These problems arise not only because insufficient resources are being put into the health services but because the health services are controlled by a series of monopolies which are highly inefficient.</P>
      <P>In Europe, we share with the United Kingdom the major problem of waiting lists, lack of services and no measure of output or outcomes. The most important step which the Minister can take in resolving the log jam is probably to relinquish control over the supply of doctors. The number of Irish students allowed in medical schools is ridiculously small. Foreign students with fewer qualifications are allowed in because they are a source of funds for the colleges. Comhairle na n-Ospidéal has a restrictive role, as does the Minister, in the supply of consultants. What is a consultant? Professional qualifications as a doctor, time served and experience are what should determine who is qualified to take a position as a consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are we restricting numbers so tightly? Even the Irish Hospital Consultants Association agrees that we need more consultants. The IMO agrees we need more GPs. Why should hospitals not recruit directly? Once the standard is set, qualified persons should be allowed to apply just like accountants and others. There are many qualified Irish candidates living here and abroad who could be encouraged to apply. There are many non-Irish candidates well qualified professional people who could be recruited. Certification of standards should be the measure and not where someone lives or where they got their qualifications once the qualifications are certified. There are many countries in which there are <Col N="967" /> many highly qualified unemployed doctors. We should open Irish medicine to them. We need more doctors, and they are available.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom has actively gone out recruiting these doctors to deal with its supply problem, and we should do the same. I would like to read an extract from <i>The Guardian </i>Weekly of 7 to 13 March 2002 headed &ldquo;German doctors to &lsquo;aid' NHS&rdquo; by John Carvel. It states:</P>
    <P>A radical plan to use German doctors to eliminate the huge National Health Service waiting list for day-case surgery before the next election is to be presented to Tony Blair this week by the former Labour minister, Frank Field.</P>
    <P>He will tell the Prime Minister that hundreds of freelance German medical teams &ndash; including consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and theatre nurses &ndash; can be made available at short notice to treat more than 500,000 patients waiting for quick operations that do not require an overnight hospital stay.</P>
    <P>The patients would not have to travel abroad. Mr. Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, will present a business strategy from German Medicine Net, a healthcare company based in Schleswig-Holstein, which is offering to set up prefabricated surgery units across England to treat all these patients at an approximate cost to the NHS of £725m.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can transform the NHS debate by dealing with the entire waiting list for straightforward operations such as cataracts, hernias and varicose veins,&rdquo; Mr. Field said.</P>
    <P>The German company will present costings that will show how the NHS outpatient waiting list could be eliminated using foreign doctors on temporary assignment in Britain.</P>
    <P>Its managing director, Hans Finck, said the latest figures showed that more than 1.8 million people were waiting for a first outpatient appointment in England, including nearly 400,000 who had been waiting for more than 13 weeks. This work could be handled by 261 German consultants working flat out for a year at an approximate cost of £155m, he said.</P>
    <P>The reason I read that out is that I am not too sure we need to replicate exactly what Mr. Field has in mind for the NHS but the British Minister for Health is out there looking to recruit German and other doctors, and we are not. The biggest problem we have &ndash; I will come to the Spanish example in a moment &ndash; in the health services is not so much the beds, which are needed but which will take time to come on stream, but qualified staff. Where there are qualified staff and competition, throughput will increase and a quality service will be provided. We have a series of monopolies and the Minister has allowed this to go on unchallenged.</P>
    <P>There is a surplus of doctors in Spain, Germany <Col N="968" /> and the eastern bloc. Why are we not recruiting them? Our medical schools are turning out insufficient numbers of doctors even to replace those who are retiring or moving on. This cannot be allowed to continue. What is even a greater scandal is that our medical schools are taking in thousands of paying students from abroad who would not have reached the standard of many of our own leaving certificate students. This problem must be addressed. Even if it was addressed in the short term, it would take many years for the supply of doctors to come into equilibrium with demand and consumer requirements and preferences.</P>
    <P>The experience elsewhere &ndash; I have in mind Spain, in particular &ndash; is that once control over the supply of doctors and consultants, other than fitness to practice in the chosen speciality, is relinquished, then market forces take over and have a dramatic impact. What happened in Spain was that after Franco, the state relinquished control over the supply of doctors and throughput and quality improved as the numbers of doctors increased, especially in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>In my research, I found that a visit to a consultant in Spain can cost &euro;10, one tenth of what it costs here. I am not advocating these rates but it shows what the market will bear in another EU state compared to what we are paying through the nose in this State. The waiting times in Spain in the public system for major items are shorter than those in the private system in Ireland, yet the percentage of GNP spent on health in Spain compares well to Ireland. According to the World Health Organisation Report 2000, Health Systems: Improving Performance, the <i>per capita</i> health spend in US dollars was Ireland $25, Spain $24. That is a comparable level of expenditure. The economic cost of an overnight stay for some of the private hospitals in Spain is lower than the charges for semi-private beds in public hospitals in Ireland at around &euro;100 per night. The advent of the euro has made this much more transparent.</P>
    <P>The cost of CAT scans and MRIs, which are paid for by insurers in Spain, are a fraction of the charges levied in Ireland. However, I note that the two insurers in Ireland have begun to compete in terms of tendering for MRI services and this is to be welcomed. Again in Spain, the public contracts for consultant services cost about half what they do in Ireland and the consultants are within the public hospitals for the first seven hours of the day.</P>
    <P>The changes the Spanish have succeeded in making to its system have been driven mainly by supply reforms. We see no sign of such a move here. The patient's needs come fifth after the Minister's political needs and the bureaucratic, providers and practitioners needs. When are we going to put the patient first? It is our job as legislators to do that but we are not doing it. The death rate in Ireland is above the EU average, and the EU average is greater than that in Canada. Not putting patients first means that people <Col N="969" /> will die sooner. We must take steps to end these monopolies.</P>
    <P>The major reform in Spain was the relinquishing of the control over the supply of doctors. Doctors in Spain now compete on grounds of quality, customer service and price. This has had the impact of driving efficiencies within hospitals and reducing the need for expected increases in bed capacity. Do we really need 3,000 more beds? We certainly need more beds. I do not have a team of economists, accountants or productivity specialists available to me to determine how many additional beds we need. If this House was to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if the problem is one of the supply of doctors or a bed shortage of 3,000, I would be surprised if he did not tell us we need only 2,000 beds because an increase in the supply of doctors would create the necessary competition and throughput to deliver a reduction in patient numbers. Of course that would be too much to do as it would upset the apple cart for some very powerful people.</P>
    <P>Hospitals in Spain also compete on quality and price. This is good for the patient. The fundamental question for the control and processes for the supply of doctors and consultants must be immediately overhauled. I know the Minister has said she will return to this in another Bill later in the year. We do not know who will be Minister later in the year. It may be Deputy McManus or me. We must return to this issue. Perhaps it is being left until after the election because the issue is going to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are many anecdotes about approved consultant posts that have remained unfilled for years. Even if some of these posts were filled, the lack of doctors would merely shift the problem elsewhere. We know the Spanish health system is regarded as being in the top six in the world. It is on a par with the health systems in France and Germany. This country has a modern image but in terms of its health system it is rated 19th and is not improving. Pushing more money into a flawed system would merely use up more of our national resources. Reform of supply is the key issue in delivering a world class health service to the people.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us appears to be technical amending legislation seeking to regularise the position of foreign doctors in Ireland. I have not tabled any amendments. Foreign doctors provide a valuable and worthwhile service to the Irish hospital system. I welcome this Bill in so far as it will enable us to overcome problems which have arisen regarding their position and length of service in the Irish system. However, we must be honest and admit that the reason we need foreign doctors in such numbers is young Irish doctors are unwilling to remain within our system. We need to examine the circumstances in Irish hospitals and address the fundamental problems which are discouraging Irish doctors and require us to bring in foreign doctors, to whom we should give a more permanent status.</P>
    <P>We must address the shortage of consultants. <Col N="970" /> Junior doctors do not get the quality of training they deserve because they often have to carry the burden in hospitals rather than spend their time in learning. The shortage of consultant posts means the prospects for advancement for junior doctors is not what it should be. Junior doctors see their colleagues go abroad to get better experience and improve their skills. In many cases they see them return for promotion to one of the limited senior posts. We have talked for long enough about a consultant-delivered service. When will it become a reality? I know the introduction of such a system requires hard negotiations with consultants about the nature of the new service. These discussions cannot be allowed to drag on indefinitely just because the Departments of Finance and Health and Children do not want to fund such a system. Irish patients, their families and those working in our hospitals deserve better.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to encourage and develop the amount of clinical research carried out in Ireland. This could increase the number of Irish doctors who remain in the Irish hospital system while also improving the quality of patient care. I know the health research strategy is committed to increasing funding for research but more needs to be done if we are to see an increase in clinical research. Clinical research helps to improve the skills of doctors and promotes the use of new and effective procedures to the benefit of Irish patients. However, I am sure the Minister is aware that there are serious indemnity issues which currently prevent the scale of research we would like. The Department of Health and Children needs to become actively involved in seeking the solutions to these indemnity issues if we want to retain our best young doctors and provide patients with the best possible treatment.</P>
    <P>I am disgusted that no journalist or newspaper has taken up the issue of the recently extended apartheid in primary care. We know there has been apartheid in secondary care for some time. Last year, on the eve of a by-election, the Minister wilfully and deliberately extended apartheid into the area of primary care. The average medical card payment was £50. Some payments were as low as £30 while others were more than £70. There is an existing agreement with the IMO that up to 40% of the population can be covered for medical cards. Last year, the Minister got the IMO to ignore its campaign of extending medical card cover to poor people. Some people who live alone receive only &euro;128 per week but no longer qualify for a medical card. The Minister persuaded the IMO to extend medical cards to those aged 70 and over. The Government offered £245 per head, plus a deal on secretaries. There was no further mention of the poor.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with 70 year olds having medical cards. Fine Gael policy calls for the doubling of income limits for medical cards. It also calls for the extension of a free GP service to everyone up to the age of 18 and beyond that for those in full-time education, to the lowest paid <Col N="971" /> 60% of the population and to everyone over 65. The Minister said that the extension of the medical card to 39,000 people aged 70 and over would cost the Exchequer £14.95 million. The poor would have to wait.</P>

      <P>We are on Second Stage and I am entitled to say what should be included in the Bill, as well as referring to elements of it with which I do not agree. It was expected that 39,000 people would apply but more than 70,000 did and the cost this year will not be £14.9 million but £30 million, or about &euro;40 million. This means the number of people covered by medical cards has fallen from 37% when the rainbow coalition was in Government to 29% because the Department of Finance refuses to pay for medical cards. Deputy Martin did the deal with the IMO and is being left to solve the problem. Sick poor people are left at home on &euro;128 a week&mdash;</P>

      <P>These people, therefore, present themselves at the accident and emergency wards. The ESRI says that for males aged 55 and over the death rate is 11 per 1,000 for the well off, who got medical cards, 22 per 1,000 for those on middle income and approximately 32 per 1,000 for those on the lowest income, who die earlier and harder. They are discriminated against, clog up accident and emergency wards, and are ignored because they live in areas where older people vote and the turn-out at elections is 30%. Apartheid such as that went down well in the American Deep South where there were two waiting rooms, one for the blacks and one for the whites. That is happening here and no bishop's encyclical or sermon from the pulpit, no newspaper editorial or journalist's investigative article mentions it. Perhaps apartheid in primary care is not sexy enough to sell newspapers, but it is the greatest scandal in the health services in my time in this House that people are deliberately discriminated against in this way without a murmur from the so-called pillars of society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that &ldquo;nowadays more and more Irish students have <Col N="972" /> decided to study medicine abroad within the EU. Many of these students would wish to return to Ireland for the purpose of completing their internship in an Irish hospital.&rdquo;  I made that point already myself, but ask the Minister to explain to the House why so many Irish students decide to study medicine abroad when we allow students, who do not have the required same, or equivalent, leaving certificate results to study here. It is a question of money as they pay £15,000 per year in fees. When we need doctors here, why are we forcing our students to go abroad to do medicine and return to do their internship here?</P>
      <P>She also stated that &ldquo;hospitals are exploring different options in an effort to ensure that all medical posts are filled. With the full co-operation of all concerned, and a commitment to making the best use of available resources, occupancy levels will be optimised.&rdquo;  Will they? I do not agree. That will not happen until we increase the supply side, as the Department of Health and Children must know.</P>
      <P>I must now correct the record as I used it to accuse the Minister of having more fora, committees, inquiries, tribunals and standing groups than there are varieties of Heinz products. I estimated it at about 65, but was shocked to find out in reply to a parliamentary question that there are 107 such bodies. All the vested interests are represented except the patient's, which is why the supply side is not being addressed. The Minister of State also said in her speech that &ldquo;the possibility of extending the working visa and work authorisation scheme, which already applies to nurses, to other health service staff is being examined by the departmental group.&rdquo;  We have had a health crisis for all of the Government's term of office, but it is only being examined now. Meanwhile, the British minister is recruiting staff from here. We have 107 different committees examining, but when we will get decisions? What do Minister's get paid for? She talks of examining while poor people wait in pain for treatment.</P>
      <P>She also spoke of &ldquo;rapid developments in health technology,&rdquo; but the teaching hospitals have cardiac scanning machines, which are vital to their work, for which they did not receive any money, last year or this year, for essential repairs or restoration. It will have a catastrophic effect when these machines break down and what happened recently in the accident and emergency wards will be minor in comparison, as this equipment is the difference between life and death. This is how we treat the health services at a time of abundance. We will not pay for the machines we have now, but the Minister of State talks of future developments. I am assured by reliable sources that people will die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also stated, &ldquo;On the capital side the high level of investment by the Government will continue over the period of the national development plan, demonstrating a considerable increase in capital investment relative, historically, to any previous period.&rdquo;  What a claim. We have had a time of unprecedented <Col N="973" /> growth in wealth and resources yet we keep our spending relative to historical previous periods when we were a poor country. There is no greater indictment than the Minister's own words. We are about to enter the fourth month of the year and still there is no budget for any of Dublin's major teaching hospitals. Their chairmen and chief executive officers recently met the EHRA and the Department because they cannot run these multi-million euro hospitals without knowing what their budgets are. They have no budgets because the Minister does not want anyone to know the true situation until the election is over. Will the Minister for Health and Children tell us why this is so? Why has St. John of God's in Islandbridge no budget agreed? We cannot run a health service like this.</P>
    <P>In concluding, the Minister of State said: &ldquo;This amending Bill, in conjunction with the main Bill later this year, will be key factors in ensuring that in five years' time there should no longer be shortages in those crucial disciplines which are currently holding back the development of much needed services.&rdquo;  These shortages were there five years ago but what has the Government done? If there are no shortages in five years' time, it will be because Deputy McManus, myself and others will be in Government taking the decisions we are paid to take. Why has this Government allowed this situation to continue for five years? The operation of the health services is appalling and what passes for good ministerial action is Ministers spending their time holding the hands of journalists, leaking information to curry favour with them, and setting up forums and committees to keep people in the hospital services happy but not taking into account the needs of the patients, especially poor patients.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reply to some of the points I raised and in particular to the question of the supply side and why the Government wilfully extended apartheid to the primary care services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the last debate in the House for this term, and possibly for this Dáil, is on a health issue. Clearly, health is the most important issue as far as the electorate is concerned, and all the research shows that. Health is also the most deficient area as far as Government policy is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that in the past five years, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have little to show for themselves in the area of health care, leaving aside the various crises that have occurred, the most recent of which was in the accident and emergency departments, a dispute which is still unresolved and may lead to further industrial action by nurses; the ongoing staff shortages in nursing; the growing shortage of doctors; the plummeting morale in our hospitals which, sadly, is being experienced by many people trying to deliver a good quality service; and the ongoing shortage in hospital and rehabilitation beds which has not been alleviated even <Col N="974" /> though the Government has been in power longer than most previous Governments.</P>
    <P>It is worth examining what this Government set out to achieve when it was formed. The programme for Government made clear commitments in the area of health. It promised to tackle the crisis surrounding hospital waiting lists, to review medical card eligibility for large families, to introduce value for money initiatives in the health service and to create a customer focused health care service. It is clear now, almost five years on, that none of these commitments has been delivered on. Approximately 26,000 public patients are still on hospital waiting lists, with many more thousands waiting to see a specialist. That figure has more than likely increased because of the industrial action which prevented elective procedures being carried out when the accident and emergency departments were affected by the nurses' industrial action. Families on low incomes, whether large or small, have had no alleviation in terms of the cost of attending a doctor. Medical card eligibility was not extended to poor families but rather to the most well off of the over 70s.</P>
    <P>A recently published Deloitte &amp; Touche report highlighted that the Department of Health and Children, and the health boards, are poorly organised, resourced and managed. The Minister for Finance decried the inefficiencies in the health service and pointed out that he put more money into the health service, even though he was a little aggrieved about it. There is now growing public dissatisfaction with the service, which is experiencing major problems. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report indicated clearly the limitations of the Department of Health and Children in terms of strategic planning and economic management. The report states:</P>
    <P>We are concerned that the remit of the Department is too broad, spanning a range of health and social service issues. The Department has been continually asked to do more; this arises in an environment where 20% of the positions within the Department are currently vacant.</P>
    <P>Furthermore there are a whole range of skill sets where the Department is either under-resourced or has no resource at all, for example financial, statistical, social analysts, strategic planning, QS, health economics, personnel with direct experience of working in the health services.</P>
    <P>When a Department is so restricted in terms of what it can do, but managed in such a hierarchical way, fundamental structural reform must be delivered on. We have not seen that. There is a saying that in politics, perception is reality. The Minister for Health and Children has created the perception that he is being effective but the experience of patients on a daily basis is different, whether in trying to get the money to go to their general practitioners or waiting for long periods in an accident and emergency department, some<Col N="975" /> times in conditions that are substandard or even dirty, sleeping on trolleys, sitting in wheelchairs or standing trying to access care. That is the reality as opposed to a perception that has been carefully spun by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In 1997, the Government's legislative programme promised a new medical practitioners Bill and a health and social care professionals regulatory Bill. We were also promised a nurses' Bill. That legislation would assist in modernising the law on the registration of health professionals and provide an appropriate supportive framework within which vital and increasingly scarce health professionals can operate, but we are still waiting for it to be brought forward. This Government is going out of office but none of these three important legislative measures has been published &ndash; not even the heads of the Bills. They have been promised for some time this year, and in that regard I am reminded of the song &ldquo;What's Another Year&rdquo;. The programme is renewed every Dáil session and the same commitment is given, only the year changes.</P>
    <P>This Bill, the purpose of which is to resolve a problem of registration, mainly for medical practitioners, cannot be considered controversial. I am sure everybody will support its passing because most of us are familiar with doctors caught up in excessive bureaucracy and with the blockage that threatens their professional futures here beyond 1 July if the problem is not addressed. The Bill deals with a problem that essentially is not new. Our over-dependence on foreign doctors to man our hospitals is long-standing and the least we owe them is a better registration system. For many years, the majority of our 2,500 junior hospital doctors came from non-European Union countries without whom our hospital service would have ground to a halt. At times doctors applied to fill a range of posts but were unable to do so because of restrictions here.</P>
    <P>Statements were made by one Government Deputy in particular, which were essentially racist in nature, but it is important that we acknowledge the debt we owe to thousands of people who came here from Asia, India and Pakistan to work in our hospitals and care for our loved ones, sometimes in conditions that were less than favourable to them. Some of these issues are still not resolved but the conditions in which these young doctors lived and worked were not good, particularly when one takes into account that most of them were far away from home and did not have family support. We took advantage of them. It was a form of exploitation and we must acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>The Bill arises out of a medical manpower crisis which goes far beyond the issue of non-EU doctors. It is a manpower crisis that is real and growing. If we are to encourage more Irish doctors to commit themselves to our health service and increase specialist and general prac<Col N="976" /> titioner numbers, a sea change must take place. Currently more than half the places in our medical schools, in effect, are reserved for non-nationals. Non-nationals bring in money. That is the reality of why this is occurring and why we do not produce enough Irish doctors. Even among the doctors who graduate from our schools, 20% of them do not engage in medical practice. We know why we are catering for foreign doctors, but we need to ask why we are losing so many precious medical graduates. If one were to ask any general practitioner about the future and health status of general practice, he or she would inevitably give a view that is, at worse, negative, and at best, mixed. There are concerns about the pressures of work but also about the difficulty in attracting young doctors into general practice. There is a famine in terms of young doctors coming into areas of disadvantage, particularly in urban areas but also in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason areas of disadvantage are experiencing difficulty in attracting young doctors or any doctors relates to the decision by the Government to favour doctors who treat wealthier patients under the medical card scheme. Deputy Mitchell was right in saying that apartheid has been introduced into primary care. This has a knock &ndash; on effect in terms of difficulty in attracting GPs to certain areas. The proportion of GPs to patients is very different in the poorer areas of our towns and cities than on, what some people refer to as, the gold coast, the east coast, where doctors are awarded and given incentives to care for private patients over the age of 70 who are better off. There is an active disincentive to care for poor families under the GMS. That must change.</P>
    <P>Whoever will be Minister, following the forthcoming election, will have to create a grant system, an incentive driven system, to encourage doctors to practise in areas where there is greatest need. We all know that poverty is an indicator of poor health, yet the Government's record ensures that reality of low health status connected to poverty is exacerbated by a policy that rewards care for the better off and negates the chance of developing better care for the poor.</P>
    <P>There is also a manpower problem in our acute hospital service, the low number of specialists compared to the high number of NCHDs. This imbalance was highlighted recently by the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board in its latest statement on the problem. This is not a new problem. We have all been aware of it for some time. It is interesting to note what the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board say about it. The board states that based on current training career requirements, there should be only 850 NCHDs above intern level as opposed to nearly 3,000 junior doctors in place at present. Its report stresses the need for radical reform in career structures if an equitable balance is to be struck between those in training and the ultimate numbers of career opportunities available.</P>
    <P>This imbalance is impacting on the care of pub<Col N="977" /> lic patients. It is not the experience of private patients that their care is being delivered by doctors in training. They have a consultant provided health service. Public patients, however, have a consultant led health service that depends greatly on NCHDs, who often work in stressful and difficult conditions. Essentially, they are doctors in training and should not be expected to carry such a burden, even though that burden has been there historically for many years. There should have been a significant shift in the imbalance over the past five years because the Government had the resources to make decisions to address the changes that were evident in our acute hospitals, but that change has not occurred and the imbalance continues.</P>
    <P>The medical manpower forum trundled on for years and now a task force is in place, but there has been no real change on the ground. That is worrying in terms of how the Minister is operating and how the Department of Health and Children, which has such power in terms of the nature of its position with regard to the hospital sector, does not recognise the changes required. Unless these manpower issues are addressed, no strategy will work and the service will continue to creak on trying to meet increased demand without being able to manage its manpower in a way that more effectively meets the needs of patients.</P>
    <P>It is worrying that the Minister thinks it is an achievement that 98% of vacancies in our hospital service are filled. How can he think that? We can only say it is an achievement when 100% of the posts are filled and can guarantee, as a matter of course, that all the posts will be filled and there would be competition for them rather than the current position of struggling to achieve the filling of 98% of posts. A new manpower drive is needed. Attention needs to be given the fact that more graduates now are women. We all know that women doctors, like women in any other sphere, will set different characteristics for their profession. They have other priorities. They are not like the traditional male doctor who seemed to be willing to work 24 hours a day and allow his spouse to carry the attendant burden of child rearing. Women doctors are bringing a difference into the profession, but the profession is not shifting and changing in accordance with what is happening on the ground.</P>
    <P>I talked to a medical student recently who spoke of his internship here compared to a friend of his, who, having trained here, will return to Norway to a similar internship programme and there was no comparison. Interns' pay is substantially higher in Norway, their conditions are substantially better, their choices are wider and their training is much more comprehensive. More and more young doctors who want to be in training will leave Ireland because they will be attracted elsewhere and meanwhile we have a difficulty in filling our posts. It takes around ten years to produce a doctor, even a GP. Where is the planning and change in policy? Leaving aside all the consultation and the myriad number of commit<Col N="978" /> tees and working groups that have been established, where is the hard concrete evidence that we will be able to produce sufficient medical practitioners to meet the needs of our population? This is not a big country, it is small one, yet it is one of the wealthiest in the world. How have we so little to show at the end of a five year period in office when the Government presided over such prosperity? </P>
    <P>Even in its own terms, the Bill is disappointing because it should have been part of a bigger Bill, a new medical practitioners Bill to amend the Act of 1978, which has outlived its usefulness. By now we should have enacted a Bill that would have dealt with the issues outlined in reply to a parliamentary question, as far back as 27 May 1999, by Deputy Cowen as Minister for Health. He stated:</P>
    <P>During previous discussions with the council and other interested bodies a number of proposed changes emerged, many of which will be non-controversial and will easily be incorporated in a new [Medical Practitioners] Bill. A number of areas which need to be changed are as follows: registration, fitness to practice, establishment of a health committee, membership of the council, and the role of the Minister. The council has also brought forward discussion documents in relation to the following items: reform of the intern year, health procedures and competence assurance standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that it was his intention to circulate draft heads of a Bill in 1999. He said he would need to prioritise these proposals in line with the relative priority of a new Nurses Act. Neither of these proposed Bills have been published in any form at all. All we have is an amendment to the current Bill which deals with a very specific and immediate problem.</P>
    <P>Several issues that should be in the Bill were listed by the Minister. It has happened on occasion that British doctors have been practising here who may not have been fully qualified or were operating in a way that was undesirable. It was clear that the overseeing role of the council and the health boards was not sufficient to protect patients from danger. For example, a report was issued about a doctor, Dr. James Ellwood, who worked as a locum consultant in various hospitals, quite a number of whose diagnoses had to be reviewed subsequently as a result of concerns about his practice. People who come to practice in Ireland are very welcome but a system of checks is needed so that the Medical Council, which is charged with this duty, can ensure good quality care for all our patients.</P>
    <P>Speaking to anybody who has gone to the Medical Council to make a complaint one learns very quickly that it is a very difficult and rather unfriendly process. I have talked to the women, for example, who were involved in a case about their experiences in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda which was discovered to have had a very high level of caesarean hyster<Col N="979" /> ectomies over a period of 20 years. Some of these women were very young when they had hysterectomies, without due consultation or, it would appear, any real need for one. Some of these cases are extremely distressing. However, when one talks to the women about their experiences at Medical Council hearings it seems that the process can be unnecessarily harsh and confrontational. This is something that needs to be reformed if we genuinely want a patient-focused health service and if we are to accept the idea that patients have rights and that there is such a thing as empowerment of patients. Otherwise it is simply a case of being fortunate enough to afford care or being grateful for access to care without payment.</P>
    <P>The lack of legislation coming from the Department of Health and Children may be explained by the fact that its officials' energies and concentration have been diverted into the production of the health strategy. The latter has just been published, within months of the Government's leaving office, yet it is already fraying at the edges. I suspect that the lack of legislation may also be explained by the referendum on abortion which divided the country and was fortunately defeated by the common sense of the people. All this has been diverting energy from the real work of any Department, which is the production of legislation. We have long been waiting for a proper and appropriate Medical Practitioners Bill which has been talked about all through the lifetime of this Government. As yet we have had neither sight nor sound of it.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill about which I have no complaints. Like Deputy Mitchell, I must take this Bill on faith. My faith in the parliamentary drafting system has been damaged by the experience of the Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, during the course of which so many errors came up that the Minister was obliged to produce amendments constantly. The Opposition had its own amendments but the Minister certainly outflanked us. This was due to mistakes in drafting. I must accept, because I have no choice, that technically this Bill is sufficient for its purpose and is not flawed. We are debating Second, Committee and Report Stages now and the Minister for Health is not even here to deal with any issues that arise on Committee Stage. I hope this Bill will sort out problems with non-EU doctors and Irish doctors training abroad. Time will tell whether it has done so.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, we need a proper Medical Practitioners Bill and a decent, effective medical manpower policy. We have seen neither. We have seen rows between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance about funding &ndash; even the funding of the health strategy has been an issue. We have also seen a row about medical manpower in the exchange of letters that was published in <i>The Irish Times</i>. Some of the points made by the Minister for Finance are valid but once again it is reinforced that the Govern<Col N="980" /> ment does not appear to have a clear direction even though it has had five years to figure out what is wrong with our health service and how to fix it. We have no commitments on funding for the future. The Minister for Finance says it is unsustainable to continue the current rate of growth in funding.</P>
    <P>At our recent conference the Labour Party made very clear how we would, over the next five years, provide an additional &euro;1 billion in capital funding. We have explained where we will find the money to meet these capital needs. However, we are still waiting for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to explain where they stand and how they see the future. The record has been one of failure. Rather than making decisions we set up a committee, a task force or a working group. Rather than having a strategic approach from day one we invent a strategy at the eleventh hour. That is not the way to develop a health service, particularly one which is under stress because of a growing population, limited resources and staff numbers &ndash; lack of beds, nursing shortages and so on. Ultimately the relationship between the patient and the doctor is the most important thing and if there are not enough doctors or if they are not at the right level and do not have the proper training, we will experience problems. We can see these problems all too clearly in the health service at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their consideration of this Bill and for agreeing to take all Stages today. I reassure them that it is a necessary technical amendment and it was important that it was taken today. I appreciate the willingness of Deputies to do that.</P>
      <P>A number of issues have been raised, some specific and others general. In the general context, the implementation of the national health strategy will bring a sense of quality and fairness to our health service, ensuring that everybody can benefit from the improved service which is backed up by investment and legislation. This minor amendment is just one of those elements of legislation. However, more major legislation is in the pipeline, including the amendment to the main Act, the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, which will be introduced in the autumn. Other legislation which is currently being prepared will provide for the regulation of the nursing profession and the health and social care professions. All that will add to the legislative basis of the national health strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was criticism today of the lack of investment in the health strategy. However, there has been a huge increase in investment in our health service, including in the level of capital investment. By any standard, an increase of 260% since 1997 is significant. In planning for our future and the health service, we as a party do not believe raiding the pension fund is the way to raise the money. We acknowledge that the success of our <Col N="981" /> future health service and strategy requires more investment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It also requires flexibility in the service so that it can respond not just to the needs of those working in the service, but particularly the needs of the patients and those who access it.</P>
      <P>A key feature in the context of what we are talking about today is the important role of non-consultant hospital doctors. I reiterate our acknowledgement and appreciation of the contribution of doctors from within the EU, and particularly doctors from outside the EU, who continue to work here and who make a major contribution. These are the people we are specifically dealing with here in terms of the amendment being put forward. It obviously would be nice if we trained all our Irish doctors at home. However, perhaps all our Irish students do not want to be trained at home. A number of people now go to other colleges by choice. This Bill will facilitate them returning from colleges abroad to do their internship here and then perhaps keeping them within the system. That is one of the values of this Bill and the number of places for students in our medical colleges is being examined by the medical education and training projects group of the national task force, in consultation with the Department of Education and Science. That group is also looking at the quality of the education and training and I agree with comments to the effect that this must be of the highest calibre.</P>
      <P>Our recruitment of doctors from abroad is very extensive. The Department and the health service employers' agencies have undertaken a range of recruitment initiatives, some of them in consultation with FÁS in Germany. We have also recruited in Australia and New Zealand and doctors from these countries are already working here. Deputy Mitchell mentioned Spain. A number of initiatives, particularly in relation to nurses, have been finalised there. Again, the facilities that this Bill allows will attract other people to come to work here. It will then be up to the Medical Council to lay down rules and regulations governing that.</P>
      <P>The supply of consultants is one of the issues that was raised. We recognise that a significant number of new consultants are needed. The precise numbers needed, facilities, time frame and costs are being looked at by the national task force on medical staffing. It is not just a case of putting in the money and recruiting all the staff now. In return for the benefits to our health system to patients, we want greater flexibility, greater management involvement and new approaches being adopted to ensure that not only is there value for money, but value for the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the consultant ratio was raised. At the moment the ratio between non-consultant hospital doctors and consultants is two to one. <Col N="982" /> We are working towards a ratio of one to one which would improve the situation for everybody involved. Again, there are differences across the system and people are needed in all parts of it. However, if we are comparing Ireland to other countries, we should compare like with like. Deputy McManus talked about Norway which has a completely different GDP and a different system. Its standard of living, for example, is different. It is therefore important that we should compare like with like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not have a system where Ministers take decisions. It is completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions in relation to health, health strategies and health systems should be based on evidence and on the advice of working groups and people in the system, not on a political perspective. Deputies criticised the legislation on the basis that it did not involve consultation with the various parties involved. Now they are saying we should go ahead with investment and legislation without consulting the various groups. There are so many stakeholders in the health system that it is important they are all kept on board. That is how the health strategy was devised, bringing those people on board and bringing together a system that can be implemented. That is why there are so many different working groups. They are the people who will have to implement the strategy in the end. It is not just a political decision, but it will be backed up by political commitment. To attract other doctors, a working visa scheme is being examined. I understand that the Minister is hopeful of having positive news in this regard in the near future. This is something that has been worked on for the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>Other issues were raised in relation to the common contract. Negotiations have recently commenced in the context of the recommendations of the national task force. This legislation is just one element of a legislative programme to back up our national health strategy. It will make a real difference to people who are currently coming to the end of their temporary registration. It will make a real difference to the health service by ensuring that we will be able to keep the services of professional people. It will also ensure that their experience can be taken into account. It will reduce the period of temporary registration for them and it will also ensure that doctors who might have had to leave the country can now remain here and apply for permanent registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Issues about doctors have been raised. One with which I particularly sympathise relates to women doctors, not so much the numbers entering the profession but the numbers leaving. What that shows above all else is the need for flexible working arrangements. That is something that must and will be worked out in order to ensure that we keep the calibre of women who <Col N="983" /> come into the profession. The system must be such that it enables them to carry out their work. This Bill will result in continuity of staffing and maintenance of service delivery. It will tackle the inequities that exist in relation to permanent registration. As the Taoiseach said this morning, the Bill, in many ways, is a first step which had to be taken immediately to enable the Medical Council to make rules regarding applications for permanent registration in which relevant validated experience would be taken into account. It is an element of our legislative programme and of our health strategy. It is also proof of the Government's commitment to making whatever changes and investing whatever moneys are necessary to make sure that we end up with a system from which inequalities have been removed and that can give important and necessary care to patients. All of us recognise the need to develop, reform and modernise but, in doing so, we are dependent on those who provide the service. We need to ensure the structures are put in place at all levels to facilitate those people and they, in turn, will provide the flexibility that is needed to deliver the service.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí as ucht na gcabhrach a thug siad inniu chun dul ar aghaidh leis an mBille seo. It is an important Bill and the Minister appreciates the willingness of Members to take it today.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister accept that we are dealing with a financial scandal? The Spencer Dock saga makes the mini-CTC project which led to the establishment of a special inquiry by a committee of this House pale into insignificance. In 1998, the Minister told the then chairman of CIE that it must choose a private sector partner for the development of 51.5 acres at Spencer Dock. CIE entered a legally binding agreement to lease the land to Treasury Holdings with a value, according to CIE, of between &euro;300 and &euro;354 million in 1998. Land in the immediately adjoining area, however, was fetching double that. CIE got no upfront payment and it has been estimated that the deal with Treasury Holdings for State owned property could be worth in the region of £2.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Did CIE commission three different estate agencies to advise it on the deal to ensure best value for the company and the taxpayer? If these reports are available, will the Minister put them into the public domain so we can see exactly what happened?</P>

      <Quest>if the RPII has received information from the British authorities to satisfy it that the high level liquid radioactive waste stored in tanks at Sellafield can withstand a major terrorist attack; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to the broadly similar Question No. 54 on 12 February 2002, in which I pointed out that while the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland did not receive any evidence from British Nuclear Fuels that the high level liquid waste storage tanks can withstand a major terrorist attack, BNFL assured it that the tanks are robust enough to endure such an attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following approaches made to the UK authorities on behalf of my Department seeking infor<Col N="987" /> mation on the consequences of a major terrorist attack on Sellafield, the UK Department of Trade and Industry recently conveyed an offer whereby the director of its Office for Civil Nuclear Security is prepared to meet the RPII in London to explain the processes which that office follows to assess the terrorist threat, evaluate the vulnerabilities and develop effective counter measures. In conveying this offer, the UK Department of Trade and Industry emphasised that it is not in a position to provide details of security measures being taken at nuclear sites as it is not British Government policy to disclose such details. My Department is considering the offer. While it falls short of what we sought, I regard it as a welcome development and my Department intends to respond positively to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the progress indicated by the Minister of State. However, we should continue to raise this issue in support of the Minister of State's actions. Does he agree that while the pernicious drip-drip of radioactive pollution into both the atmosphere and sea from Sellafield is entirely unacceptable, the very real danger of a catastrophe arises from the unnecessary storage at the plant of large amounts of highly active liquid waste in over ground tanks connected to one another by overhead pipes? Does he agree that an additional danger arises from the fact that these tanks must be continuously cooled, failing which they would explode probably causing a chain reaction? The effect of such an explosion would be in the region of 1,000 times stronger than the Chernobyl explosion.</P>
      <P>Does he further agree that we must persist in pressing the British authorities to hasten the vitrification process whereby this highly radioactive liquid waste is turned into a form of glass which can be stored safely without the risks associated with the highly liquid gas? What further action beyond that outlined does he propose to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with the Deputy's comments and I will be happy to comply with his exhortations to continue to press the UK authorities to ensure these tanks of high level radioactive waste in liquid form are vitrified. We have repeatedly informed the UK authorities of our major concerns about the storage of this liquid waste in tanks, most recently this week at an international journalists' seminar in London where I met the British Minister responsible for energy, Brian Wilson, and emphasised our demands in this regard. We will continue to demand the completion of the process of vitrification which renders this very dangerous material into a safer mode for storage. It is taking too long and we have exhorted the UK authorities to expedite the process in order that the entire contents of their storage tanks will be vitrified long before the deadline date of 2015. We have urged them to introduce extra lines with a view to <Col N="988" /> expediting the process and we will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State press the British authorities to set a date for the removal from the Sellafield site of reprocessed waste given that this has not been done despite the obligation of the British authorities under an international agreement to return it to its country of origin &ndash; in this case primarily Germany and Japan? Does he agree that the Sellafield issue is a persistent bone of contention between two otherwise friendly countries? Will he, therefore, exert political pressure on the British authorities to close the plant as a senior Norwegian Government Minister recently demanded and thus remove this bone of contention between our countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's comments almost exactly match my words in London earlier this week. I informed my British colleague that the friendly relations between our two countries act as a global role model in terms of the peace we achieved on the island through the Good Friday Agreement and all that has emanated from it in terms of interaction and the other great work that is being done. Sellafield is the one area on which we are in disagreement. This must come to an end and through the UK realising the severity and seriousness of our concerns and responding to our demand to cease activities at Sellafield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Both I and my officials remain in constant contact with Aer Lingus on matters relating to its survival plan. I met the chairman last week for an update. He advised me that while a degree of stability has emerged, market conditions continue to be difficult in the international aviation sector and the airline remains vulnerable to external shocks. The challenge to remain competitive is ongoing and unrelenting in this difficult sector.</P>
      <P>The chairman also advised me that significant progress summarised as follows has been made in relation to the plan: the 25% reduction in capacity came into effect with the introduction of the winter flight schedules and will continue into the summer season; the voluntary severance/early retirement programme is proceeding satisfactorily; extensive work practice and other changes as set out in the survival plan are being implemented to yield the required cost savings; and a number of non-essential assets have been sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the survival plan has been assisted by aggressive cost management and a <Col N="989" /> recovery in the volume of sales due to fare promotion initiatives and the upgraded Internet facility. The board will consider the 2001 accounts at its meeting today. I understand that due to the progress on survival plan measures outlined earlier, the results for the year will show an improvement on the projected substantial loss at the operational level in the survival plan. However, I am also advised that significant exceptional costs arose in 2001 with the result that a large overall loss will arise for the year.</P>
    <P>In relation to performance in 2002, I am advised that there has been a recovery in traffic volumes on the transatlantic route, but yields are considerably below budget projections and previous year levels. In addition, market conditions on some European routes are reported as difficult. On the other hand, notwithstanding the current difficulties, Aer Lingus continues to monitor opportunities for new and more profitable services within the constraints of existing resources.</P>

        <i>Additional information.</i>It was in this context that the company recently decided to introduce new services to Malaga, Barcelona, Alicante, Nice and Faro through the redeployment of aircraft from other European routes where the number of daily services had been reduced due to lack of demand. There is no doubt that considerable management action and initiative will be required in 2002, both to fully implement the very significant changes envisaged in the survival plan in the timescale required and to continue to meet revenue and operating targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of external investment, there is no question, given the company's vulnerability, in particular, the weak balance sheet, that such investment is necessary to support its future development and the Government decision of 23 October 2001 to facilitate private sector and staff investment in the airline still stands. Considerable <Col N="990" /> progress has been made on the increased staff shareholding in the company and I expect talks to resume on this matter shortly after Easter.</P>
    <P>Arrangements to give effect to the private sector investment will not be activated pending resolution of the pilots' dispute. The dispute is the subject of arbitration and facilitation processes, as proposed by the Labour Relations Commission, which are expected to be completed shortly.</P>

        <b>: </b>I thank the Minister for bringing the House up to date on the rescue plan. One of the key and integral components of the survival plan was that a strategic partner was to be found for Aer Lingus. What is the current position in this regard? How many contacts have been made about prospective partners and with which companies? What has been the outcome of these contacts, in other words, is there a strategic partner on the horizon?

A facilitator was appointed to examine ways of dealing with the 80 pilots and it is understood that the reports of both Phil Flynn and John Russell are to be circulated by the Labour Relations Commission after Easter. The Deputy is right in that the Government decided to facilitate private sector investment but until the survival plan is fully implemented that cannot happen.</P>

      <P>Also, was one of the difficulties highlighted about the company the fact that, regarding transatlantic traffic, there has been a decline in front of plane passengers who are paying top dollar?

Regarding the transatlantic routes, it is the higher paying passengers who are not there because companies have cut back on staff travel. Clearly that has had an effect.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by Iarnród Éireann that the Kingscourt line is open to traffic. The only traffic up to recently was freight &ndash; gypsum &ndash; from Kingscourt to Drogheda and Limerick cement factories. This traffic was discontinued last year following a decision by the customers of Iarnród Éireann to transfer their business to road hauliers as a proposed increase in charges by Iarnród Éireann to part finance capital investment on the line was unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Arising from the report &ldquo;Iarnród Éireann: The Way Forward&rdquo;, I recently announced a major strategic study which will provide a strategic framework for future Government decisions on rail development over the next decades and will provide priorities for investment. The study will include a particular examination of the future potential of rail freight in contributing to economic development and environmental considerations and the funding issues arising, including those raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the information he sent me recently on European ideas on corralling funding for rail subventions.</P>
      <P>The study will also take account of the recent EU Commission White Paper on European transport policy towards 2010 which aims to promote the revival of the rail network in the EU and particularly the rail freight network.</P>

Similar lines have also been put into disuse, to use the terms the Iarnród Éireann spin doctors now use for closure. I asked a specific question about this line so the Minister could answer: this line is closed and while Iarnród Éireann acknowledges it is, the Government said no lines would be closed.

      <P>When I was dealing with this question yesterday I spoke to the assistant secretary in charge of this and he got straight back to Iarnród Éireann because I agree with the Deputy: there seems to be a distinct contradiction between the reply as written here and the actuality.</P>
      <P>The Kingscourt line is open to traffic but there is no traffic on it because Iarnród Éireann sought a 25% price increase from its only two customers on the line. A £3 million investment was required at the time and Iarnród Éireann sought a 25% increase in its charges. I agree that this matter has occasioned much correspondence. My remark that more and more heavy freight will have to be carried on the rail network rather than the roads, which are congested with huge trucks, has also occasioned a great deal of correspondence.</P>

        <b>: </b>Following the Minister's comment that a report on freight is awaited, has she contacted Iarnród Éireann with a view to a deferral of its proposal to decrease its freight handling business? Such a move would mean the loss of 400 jobs and a huge increase in the volume of heavy traffic, leading to further congestion on our roads which are already clogged with articulated trucks. Coillte has decided to transfer its freight to Limerick and Waterford by road rather than continuing to use the rail network. There is an urgent need to defer this disastrous plan to move away from transferring freight by rail, especially as the rest of Europe is encouraging such transport where possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with such a perception. The contributions of many Ministers last Tuesday in Brussels during the discussion on the rail freight industry made clear that there is an expectation that rail freight customers should pay their way, as distinct from being heavily subsidised. I have told the chairman, to answer Deputy Higgins's question, that the Government wishes to see an increase in the quantity of freight carried on our rail lines. The Taoiseach and I have made this clear in the Dáil <Col N="994" /> and it continues to be our position. I imagine that the study will show clearly the financial aspects of Iarnród Éireann's considerations. I hope there will be a ring fencing of income, as proposed by Deputy Stagg on a previous occasion, to allow rail freight to continue to be carried. The customer must pay, however, as freight cannot be carried inexpensively.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament recently concluded discussions on a draft directive amending Directive 97/67EC with regard to the further opening to competition of community postal services. The weight limits in the reserved area will be reduced to 100g in 2003 and 50g in 2006 with corresponding price limits of three and two and a half times the standard tariff. Outgoing international mail may continue to be reserved within the same weight and price limits to the extent necessary to ensure the provision of universal services. A study is to be completed by the Commission on the impact of full liberalisation on the universal service in member states, leading to a report to the European Parliament and Council of Ministers by the end of 2006 and a proposal confirming the date of 2009 for full liberalisation of the market, if appropriate, or determining any other step in the light of the conclusions of the study. There is no firm date as yet for these matters to return to the Council after consideration by the Parliament. I will not finish the reply as I fear I will be halted by the Acting Chairman.</P>

      <P>These measures have no implications for the provision of postal services in rural areas. An Post, as the designated universal service provider, will continue to be obliged to provide a nationwide service at a common tariff. While it is clear that further liberalisation of the letter post market will have an impact on An Post's core business, it will also present opportunities. I am confident that An Post, which <Col N="995" /> remains competitively positioned in the European Union in terms of price and quality of service, will meet the challenge of an increasingly liberalised market. The Deputy is aware that a significant part of the postal sector is liberalised. An Post competes with reasonable success in this part of the market. A significant number of private operators in the courier and express carrier sector, which are in competition with An Post, are important in their own right in the provision of critical services to the economy.</P>

        <b>: </b>Has the Minister discussed with An Post the consequences of the full liberalisation of the postal market? Is the recent announcement by An Post that it plans to lay off 1,100 or 1,200 of its postal staff, without adequate consultation with the Communications Workers' Union of Ireland, related to liberalisation? What deadline or target date has been set for full liberalisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post made clear that the proposed staff severances were to be achieved by the end of 2003, which is 21 months away, and were to be of a voluntary nature. The European Commission's study into the impact of full liberalisation on the universal service in member states is to be completed by the end of 2006, which is over four years from now. If it is appropriate, a proposal will be made confirming 2009 as the date of full liberalisation of the market or determining any other step in light of the conclusions of the Commission study. To answer Deputy Higgins's question, the Council of Ministers will receive a report from the European Parliament by 2006 and it is proposed that there will be full liberalisation by 2009.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if further liberalisation of the Irish postal market is possible and I ask the Minister to tell the House what is envisaged. Couriers deliver all types of messages and people communicate via e-mail, so I do not see what more can be done. I read that in terms of units of delivery, e-mails outstripped ordinary post in the United Kingdom last week. Will the Minister guarantee that the system of equal charges for the delivery of an item of post, regardless of the part of the country in which one lives, will remain? Will an equal level of service be maintained in all areas? Is it a policy objective of the Government to ensure that guaranteed next day delivery continues?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a policy of the Government that An Post should retain its designation as Ireland's universal service provider. An Post does not guarantee next day delivery in all areas, although it strives for such a service where possible. The Government favours a gradual and controlled movement towards the liberalisation of the postal market, subject to certain safeguards in relation to the universal service, and its current relatively modest proposals reflect that view. Full liberalisation is not envisaged before 2009. I understand the mayhem in the United Kingdom at present has been caused by a declaration of liberalisation five years too early.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I published my policy framework for the regulation of the communications, energy and transport sectors, Governance and Accountability in the Regulatory Process, in March 2000. As the title indicates, that policy framework embraces the governance and the accountability aspects of regulation for the economic sectors within the scope of my Department.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, to which the Deputy refers specifically, I would point out that, the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, is to be updated by the Communications Regulation Bill, 2002. Under the provisions of the 2002 Bill, the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation will be replaced with a commission for communications regulation. Under the new measures the commission will be accountable to committees of the Oireachtas, will present its strategy statement to the Minister and to such committees of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas as the Minister may, from time to time direct, and adopt a code of financial management and the publication of the code.</P>
      <P>As regards regulation in the other sectors for which I have responsibility, my policy, as articulated in Governance and Accountability in the Regulatory Process, is now being implemented through the various legislative documents that my Department has been bringing forward for the regulation of the individual sectors. It is interesting to note that the OECD in its recent document on regulation and governance quoted from that policy document which I published in March 2000.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister assure the House, when reviewing the matter of regulation gener<Col N="999" /> ally, that the system as established by the Government consists mainly of existing regulators? Will she agree it would be desirable to get some agencies from outside the State, who have experience of being regulated, to examine the system of regulation rather than regulators looking at how they should regulate which, effectively, is what the review of regulation consists of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not consist mainly of that. The policy document certainly did not consist of that. The OECD issued a strong policy document, which was launched by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and I about a month ago, in which it commented on regulation within all the countries it had studied. In it, it mentioned, with some appraise, the policy document which I published in March 2000. I agree that a shape needs to be put on regulators. I hope the telecommunications regulation Bill, which has passed through the Seanad, will be taken in the House on 16 or 17 April. I hope we can reach some agreement on it. Deputy Stagg and I have often discussed the whole issue of regulation which is required by the EU. Deputy Stagg worked on telecommunications regulation while I worked on regulation in the aviation industry.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister accept that we are over-regulating? In most other European countries regulation applies only to those who have more than 20% of the market, in other words, significant market providers. In Ireland, certainly from the point of view of the ODTR, the smallest entrant into the market is being regulated. Therefore, the kind of competition that should take place at the bottom end of the market with the new entrants being allowed scope to compete among themselves is not happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In comparison with other European countries Ireland has been slower to introduce regulators. Regulation is required under an EU directive and is introduced here by statutory regulation. While it might be said politicians interfere too much, under the system of regulation they have no role. One wonders which is the better method. However, regulation is beginning to balance out in various areas in which it is evident.</P>

On the other hand, some of those areas have become so complex and weighted down with huge financial considerations. We have been particularly lucky here with the system <Col N="1000" /> of regulation and certainly in the areas of telecommunications, electricity and aviation very fine people are running them.</P>

      <P>I read, as did Deputies Stagg and Jim Higgins, various newspaper reports about Connex. Indeed, Deputy Higgins brought these reports to our attention. As this was prior to the contract being allocated I attributed these to a dirty tricks campaign by people who feared they would not get the contract. Since then, officials in my Department and in the Rail Procurement Agency have gone to London and Sweden to look at how Connex is doing business there. In parts of the UK the outcome is not very desirable but in those places the company did not take over a greenfield operation. In Sweden and another Nordic country the company's operations have received accolades. The reports on Connex <Col N="1001" /> are mixed, as Deputy Stagg says. I did not allocate the contract to Connex. That was done by an independent outside group.</P>

      <P>The consultation paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, which I published in September 2000, outlined the Government's proposals for institutional and regulatory reform of the public transport system, including independent regulation. Recognising the scope and importance of the proposed changes, the paper has been the subject of extensive consultation with the social partners through the public transport partnership forum. At the request of the forum I extended the consultation period to allow it to carry out independent research to assist it in making a formal response to the consultation paper. The consultants engaged by the forum have reported and I expect that the forum will shortly conclude its consideration of the proposals and submit its response.</P>
      <P>In the meantime proposals for a new strategic land use and transport authority for the greater Dublin area were published in April 2001 in the Government consultation paper, Institutional Arrangements for Land Use and Transport in the greater Dublin area. Legislation to establish this authority is being prepared and a consultancy study on the regulation of the bus market outside the greater Dublin area is nearing completion.</P>

        <b>: </b>Who will the regulator be? There are ongoing court challenges by private companies against Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath and these lead to the courts becoming the regulator. There was a recent landmark judgment in the High Court in the case taken by the Nestor bus company in Galway against Bus Éireann. These cases have opened up a certain amount of competition. Who will the regulator be and who will have the final say? Would the Minister favour the appointment of an independent regulator to oversee the market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a regulator would be very desirable, particularly in public transport. The recent decision in the Nestor case is being studied in my Department. The idea of a regulator is a good one but I would not want to deal with the question of competition with too heavy a hand. The work we have done in the forum, the preparation and introduction of the legislation and the changes resultant in the 1932 legislation form an agenda for whoever comes into my office after the general election. He or she will have a packed agenda in that regard. What we have done has led up to that. The appointment of a regulator would serve everyone in the bus market but competition must be introduced properly and legally, in line with the updating of the 1932 Act.</P>

      <P>On 8 March I announced a major drive to bring high speed broadband access to 67 priority towns around the country. I launched phases one and two of a regional broadband programme which will, ultimately, see investment of up to &euro;160 million in delivering town fibre-optic networks in key locations regionally. Both phases involve investment in each of the 26 counties.</P>
      <P>Phase one of the broadband programme will see 19 towns, many in the Border, midlands and west region, targeted immediately. Metropolitan area fibre-optic networks will be built in these towns to link up with the backbone network in the country. I sent the details of this to all Deputies.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide &ldquo;always on&rdquo; low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda.</P>
      <P>The first phase is being conducted in association with local and regional authorities which will receive 90% funding from the Exchequer. A total of &euro;44 million is allocated this year in the Department of Public Enterprise Vote for this measure, which should be completed in full next year at a full cost of &euro;60 million.</P>
      <P>Phase two will witness the expansion of broadband networks in the remaining 48 towns. This will be completed through a public private partnership and involve a total investment of approximately &euro;100 million. Phase two should be completed within three years.</P>
      <P>Phase three, which is contingent on the success of the first two phases, will involve rolling out the programme to cover all 123 towns in the State with a population of 1,500 or over and the target date for completion is five years.</P>

        <b>: </b>I thank the Minister for her reply. We do not have any broadband in this country. What we purport to be broadband is, in fact, ISDN which only downloads at about one third the speed of the ordinary, standard telephone. In that context, we would welcome broadband. Does the Minister accept that because of the system of charging that operates in this country, that is, one is charged by the minute rather than at a flat rate, broadband or the benefits of broadband will be largely outside the scope of the majority of people and small companies? It can cost up to &euro;2,000 per month, for example, for continuous access to the Internet, whereas in the United States it costs $35, in Iran it costs the equivalent of &euro;35 and the UK it costs about £40 sterling &ndash; flat rate &ndash; per month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what the Deputy purports is correct. The provision of the fibre optic cable is 90% funded by the Government and 10% funded by local authorities. Over the next few weeks, my Department will draw up and sign the contracts with the local authorities. I think Mayo put in one for Ballina in the first phase which has been agreed. It is our wish &ndash; I have no doubt it will be fulfilled &ndash; that the provision of the infrastructure, that is, the broadband which is massively grant aided, will enable competition to come in and to deliver the last mile. Already it seems that is what will happen. Competition will drive the price down &ndash; that is what has happened in other countries. Last Tuesday when I was in Brussels and later that night at the dinner with Hillary Clinton, there was huge interest in this matter. The Deputy's premise is right but the application of the grant aid for the infrastructure will enable the companies to come in and provide the last mile at, I hope, competitive rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the privatisation of the telecommunications industry has been an unmitigated disaster which has led to a situation which she has described where the local authorities and the State have to get directly involved in rolling out broadband around the country because the privatised industries controlled from abroad have told the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government where to go? Even with serious grants available, they simply were not interested. Will there be permanent ownership of the infrastructure she is providing or does the Minister propose to use taxpayers' money to provide the infrastructure and then hand it over to private operators to satisfy this need for competition and the duplication that comes with the competition?</P>

      <P>The realisation of £4 billion, which has gone into the pension fund and which I am glad neither Fine Gael nor Fianna Fáil <Col N="1005" /> intend to raid, is surely a good thing. The provision of broadband access for the first 19 towns, the first metropolitan fibre ring areas, will be leveraged on to phase two. The fruits of phase one will form the bedrock for phase two and so on to phase three. We all know &ndash; although we close our eyes and are very blinkered &ndash; that telecommunications stocks plunged from 1999 and onwards and are only now beginning to tread water again. Ownership of the fibre of the broadband infrastructure will be put through on a public private basis. We are now working out the legalities of these matters that will be worked into the contract which we will sign with the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports that a shipment of MOX fuel from Japan to Sellafield is due to take place later this year. I understand that the proposed shipment will contain the MOX fuel pellets produced at the Sellafield MOX demonstration facility which was at the centre of the safety data falsification incident in 1999. I understand that the plutonium in the MOX fuel being returned from Japan may be recovered and manufactured into new MOX fuel and then returned to Japan. If this is the case, and depending on the timing of the shipment, the United Kingdom may be in breach of the terms of an undertaking given by it to the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea. I have written to the United Kingdom on this matter seeking full details of this shipment and confirmation that the returned fuel will not be returned to the MOX plant. Once I receive a reply from the United Kingdom, I will consider further the options available to us.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Does he agree the transportation of large volumes of radioactive materials on the Irish Sea is highly undesirable? Is he aware of the recent incident where the<i> Atlantic Osprey</i>, a ship which carries fuel to and from the MOX plant and the other facilities at Sellafield, went on fire while it was leaving the docks there?

      <P>The incident to which Deputy Stagg referred serves to highlight the concerns we have and which Ireland voiced in regard to the transportation of nuclear materials by sea. It certainly justifies our protestations regarding this undesirable practice. As regards the<i> Atlantic Osprey</i>, the vessel to which Deputy Stagg referred, a fire occurred in the Manchester ship canal earlier this week. Fortunately, the vessel was unloaded at the time but it could have been otherwise. We have sought a response and explanation for this. We have asked the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to investigate this matter and to try to discover the implications for the marine environment, and human life, had this vehicle been loaded.</P>

        <b>: </b>Is the Minister of State frustrated at the lies, deceit and misinformation that constantly flow from the British, despite numerous court judgments that have obliged them to provide accurate information? Is he frustrated at the arrogance, contempt and total disregard for the rightly held views of countries, such as Ireland, who would feel the effects of any incident at Sellafield? What is the position regarding the establishment of a coalition of international non-nuclear countries that could really take on the British? Norway has a common interest. As a cohesive force such a coalition might be in a position to face down the contempt and arrogance of the British.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to answer this question. I have been in this job for almost five years and I became annoyed and frustrated after a year. My predecessors must also have felt frustrated and annoyed. I have endeavoured through meetings with UK Ministers to resolve this but have achieved nothing. That is precisely why I called in a Queen's Counsel to work with our experts. I also called in economic experts. I called them in to prepare as well as possible for a case to be taken in the international courts. That preparation went on for two and a half years. It enabled me to go to Government in May of last year seeking authorisation for taking the case. That was borne out of the frustration that I and my predecessors felt. The Government is resolved to proceed with these cases in the international courts to ensure these installations are brought to an end.</P>

      <P>A community has been devastated by an unforeseen flood. Many of the people <Col N="1009" /> involved had insurance but have not had much experience in dealing with insurance companies or loss adjusters. They are of the considered view that they are being badly and oppressively treated by the insurance companies because of the nature of their community. My colleagues and I support that view. Were this a strident and self-confident middle class part of Dublin, the insurance companies would not treat them with such a superior and bullying attitude.</P>
      <P>These companies apply for licences from the Minister to provide insurance. They are abusing their positions in the manner in which they are treating this vulnerable and devastated community.</P>

      <P>When disaster hits an area the story soon moves off newspaper front pages but the hardship and difficulty remain for the people concerned. That is the case in Ringsend and Irishtown in particular. People have had to leave their homes. Last night more than 200 people met in the latest of a series of meetings. Residents expressed their concern and there was unanimous agreement that they were suffering serious difficulties in the speedy and effective processing of their insurance claims. So great is the concern about this that the four TDs from the constituency issued a joint statement calling on the insurance companies to fastrack the applications. We called on them to look at the overall picture and to see that the area has been devastated. The insurance companies should be conscious of this in their individual responses to each applicant. They should also be conscious that people have had to leave their homes and that their lives have been totally disrupted. They have lost their belongings and their community has been seriously affected by this dreadful flooding.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to call on the insurance ombudsman to examine the overall position in an effort to fastrack the claims.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to intervene on behalf of the Government seeking a more comprehensive, faster and more effective response from the insurance industry than we have seen to date. It would make a difference to people who could get on with rebuilding their homes and lives.</P>

      <P>It is terrible to have to look on and see friends and neighbours affected in this way by floods. As the waters receded, so too did the media interest although the situation is worse now as the area is a building site. Houses are literally gutted and people's lives turned upside down because of the floods. It is an intolerable situation which is made worse by the behaviour of the insurance companies. I am tired of their pettiness and ask them to behave with decency, humanity and not like cowboys. They adopt a superior, dismissive attitude which is unacceptable. There are many individual stories and people cannot understand the ping-pong between the loss assessors and adjusters leaving the ordinary person as piggy-in-the-middle. Some of these are elderly and they suffer great stress. The ball is in the Minister's court and he must take these people to task. We must have regulation of insurers. I know <Col N="1010" /> that they also feel under stress and that insurance claims have gone through the roof because of 11 September, but, at the end of the day&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to insurance matters, my role relates to the authorisation and prudential supervision of insurance companies with head offices in the State and to the monitoring and evaluation of insurance cost trends and the key contributory factors. Insurance cover is provided by individual insurance companies and I am not in a position to interfere in their underwriting or claims settlement procedures.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies have their own procedures in place for investigating, handling and processing claims. From a prudential point of view, it is important that full information on claims made against insurance companies is available to them, so that genuine claimants may receive payment appropriate to the particular circumstances of their case. While I would not have information in relation to claims made arising out of the flooding referred to, it may be that in some cases insurers required further information from claimants before settlement of those claims. Indeed, some cases may have required more detailed investigation.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that I do not have a role in relation to the processing and settlement of claims by insurance companies, at the request of my Government colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, I raised this matter with the Irish Insurance Federation and with representatives of the main insurers today. I asked that the processing of such claims be dealt with as expeditiously as possible by the companies in a fair manner that is consistent with prudential requirements. I was assured that there has been no undue delay in these cases. If there are any individual difficulties and the Deputies refer them to me, I will in turn refer them to the IIF for immediate attention.</P>
      <P>I was given guarantees by the chief executives of the main companies, whom I met today, that where loss adjusters, claims adjusters and assessors made recommendations, there was no difficulty in responding to them and that delays were the result of some information being outstanding. I am prepared to take to the IIF every individual case that comes to my attention from Deputies, just as I acted immediately today.</P>

      <P>Inevitably, another Deputy has to raise again the issue of schools building projects and I raise the case of Mount Bruis, County Tipperary. It has 58 pupils, three full-time teachers, a shared remedial teacher and a part-time resource teacher. It is a 40 year old cold, damp building, which is unsuitable for modern teaching. The classrooms are inadequate and only half the size <Col N="1011" /> needed by today's standards. The five foot by five foot cloakrooms double as classrooms for the remedial and resource teachers. The toilet, which is shared by male and female staff, doubles as an office and a person can hardly get into it because of the presence of a photocopier. Rooms reek of dampness.</P>
      <P>The school awaits approval to move to the design team phase, but the committee to nominate one has not been allowed to meet by the Minister since April 2001. I ask that a team be appointed immediately. I do not want to know how much the Minister spent in the last 12 months or any other month, but to know when he will grant approval to the building project for this small, rural school. I also do not want to hear that it will start as soon as possible. The parents, pupils, clergy and people of west Tipperary want a date on which the design team will be appointed and I hope that the Minister will tell me.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department's current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Mount Bruis national school, County Tipperary. At present, the school has a staffing level of a principal, two mainstream classroom teachers, a shared remedial teacher and a shared resource teacher, which is two extra appointments. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 56 pupils. The school's current facilities consist of two permanent classrooms, a prefab and limited ancillary accommodation. The Department has received an application from the management authorities of the school for grant assistance towards the provision of additional accommodation.</P>
      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools, such as Mount Bruis national school, Tipperary, under its expanded school building programme. Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>A proposed major building project for Mount Bruis national school will proceed to architectural planning as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>I am aware that 850 schools are held up, although I have some letters assuring me that there is no postponement. I raised on the Adjournment that I was misled by the answers I got because I was in direct contact with schools.</P>
      <P>This school in Carlow, Scoil Eoghain Uí Thuairisc, was founded 20 years ago. It started off with temporary, prefabricated classrooms and, 20 years later, that is still the position. The school now has 18 teachers and 440 pupils who do not have permanent accommodation. Fiche bliain ag fás, agus ag fás go tapaidh.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, three prefabricated classrooms were added on to the school. They did not bother putting in toilets because they presumed the new building project would commence on the site which they had purchased for &euro;500,000. The school pays rent of &euro;2,000 per year for the current site and &euro;2,000 for the rental of the three prefabs which they decided not to buy because it was a temporary measure. I tabled a question to the Minister and the reply was that the work would go ahead as soon as possible, which means nothing.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to skip most of his reply, which I presume outlines all the money the Government has spent in this area, and say what he intends to do for these 440 children who are accommodated in prefabricated, temporary classrooms, three of which have no toilets. Getting in and out of these classrooms can also be a problem on rainy days. That is an impossible position for such a large school and I hope the Minister will outline some progress on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to again raise this important issue in the House, and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House at this late hour before the Easter recess to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue, which I first raised in the House last November, concerns 190 farmers whose animals were taken from their farms by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and slaughtered in Henshaws meat plant. Payment in respect of a total of 125 animals has not been made because the Henshaws cheques bounced. Twenty-one of those animals were bought under valuation and I thought at that stage that pay<Col N="1014" /> ment had been made on those animals but I have since learned that some of the cheques are still with the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>I will tell the Minister of State about one old age pensioner who sold the last of his cattle to Henshaws, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This man did not have a clue where these cattle were being taken. He put the last of his animals in the hands of Department officials to dispose of them under the disease eradication programme but the cheque for those animals is still in that man's house some five months later. It is totally unacceptable that farmers should be left out to dry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development advised me that this is a difficult situation and that he cannot speak for meat factories. I am not talking about that. I am talking about animals which were removed from farmers by the Minister's officials. Those farmers had no choice in how the animals were sold. They were not given any indication where the animals were going until the lorry arrived.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised at that time, and I hope I hear something positive from the Minister of State now, that the Attorney General would deal with the problem. I realise the Attorney General has been busy but it only took him ten days to deal with the problem of the Taoiseach's own project. He has had five months to deal with this problem. This problem needs to be dealt with quickly and the farmers paid.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that many farmers have not been paid moneys due to them since last October by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The excuse given for the delay is that the computers are not compatible and the area aid section and other sections are not able to sort it out.</P>
    <P>I bring two cases to the attention of the Minister of State, one of which I raised in the House last February. The reply I received at that time was to the effect that the problem would be sorted out under the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, that the details regarding the purchase of the animals had been inputted and that the cheque would be issued in February. That money still has not been paid.</P>
    <P>Another case was brought to my attention today by my colleague from west Cork, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who was delighted to get the news that one of his constituents will soon receive a cheque for almost &euro;11,000, which was due to him last October.</P>
    <P>Is it acceptable that money owed to so many farmers is not being paid because of difficulties with the computer system in the Department? The Minister of State will tell me that payments are made in 95% or 98% of cases but if a farmer or a farmer's wife is not paid the money they expect to get &ndash; and one figure is &euro;11,000 &ndash; what do they tell their bank manager or suppliers? Banks are being extremely strict with farmers at the present time; I have been shown some letters from them.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make payments on the basis of necessity. The beef farmers will not run away but they will be gone if they cannot get the <Col N="1015" /> necessary funding to pay their bills and other expenses on a daily basis. Six months is too long to wait and while the numbers involved may be small, there is no excuse for the delay in payment to these farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for accepting this matter and Deputy Crawford for raising it. I fully appreciate the seriousness of the two issues he raised.</P>
      <P>As regards the first aspect, the position is that the procedure for disposing of reactor animals under the TB and brucellosis disease eradication schemes operates on the basis that meat factories tender on a weekly basis for the slaughter of these animals. The Department selects the meat factories on the basis of the prices they offer for different types of animals.</P>
      <P>Under current arrangements, compensation for reactor animals comprises the salvage value of the animal which is paid by the factory directly to the farmer and a reactor grant, or live valuation less the salvage value paid to the farmer by my Department. The Deputy will be aware that the reactor grant regime will be discontinued when the valuation system is extended to all breakdown situations from next month.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that at all times the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer and, therefore, the contract for the salvage value is a matter between the farmer and the meat factory involved. My Department's responsibility is to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and to pay the appropriate compensation.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances where a factory goes out of business, such as happened in the case in question, the recovery of any moneys due to losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between themselves and the company's liquidators. The Deputy said this matter has been referred to the Attorney General. I will pursue it and try to get an update on the position because there is no reference to that in this reply. As the Deputy raised this issue, he is entitled to a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second issue, the position is that over the past four years my Department has made major strides in the timely and efficient delivery of payments to farmers. We have set quality of service as an integral part of all our operations. We acknowledge the importance of providing services in an efficient, effective and user-friendly manner. In the period since 1 January 2001 to date, in excess of &euro;1.286 billion has issued to farmers under the various premium and area based compensatory allowance schemes of which about &euro;875 million relates to payments made under the 2001 schemes. Over the past month alone, over 103,000 payments totalling <Col N="1016" /> almost &euro;112 million have been made. The process of introducing a new mapping and area aid processing system has raised some issues in clearing a small number of payments. The first and main phase of that redevelopment has now been completed and every effort has been made to keep any delay to a minimum, including the use of manual payments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the schemes for which I have direct responsibility, the rural environment protection scheme and the area aid scheme, I monitor where problems arise in regard to them by way of parliamentary questions and I also keep in contact with my officials. It surprises me that when many farmers are written to, they do not reply and many of them do not reply to a second letter. When information is needed for audit purposes, it is important that farmers reply to us.</P>
    <P>My Department has been making progressive use of the CMMS database in processing applications since 1997-98. In line with EU requirements, cross-checks against the CMMS have intensified since January 2000. The relevant regulation stipulates that premiums can be paid only in respect of an animal which is properly recorded on the CMMS. For example, under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme, over 1.1 million animal tag numbers have been cross-checked in this manner and difficulties arose initially in respect of 30,000 tags or 2.7% of animals. These difficulties mainly relate to farm-to-farm movements where, unfortunately, the buyer or the seller, or both, fail to notify the movement to the CMMS. We are also experiencing difficulties with birth and death notifications to the database. In a number of cases, animals being applied for as cows were, according to the CMMS, heifers at the time of application. A further difficulty arises where farmers dispose of animals on which they have applied for premium during the retention period. My Department, through contact with individual farmers, is making every effort to have all these outstanding problems cleared as quickly as possible. I have dealt with a large number of cases through my constituency office and non-notification of animal movement is a major issue.</P>
    <P>My Department's fundamental objective is to serve the citizen in a proper, fair and impartial manner which will ensure a high degree of farmer and public confidence. Raising the quality of services and responding positively to customer needs is and will continue to be an operational priority for my Department.</P>

      <P>On 8 March 2002, I announced a major drive to bring high speed broadband access to 67 priority towns around the country.</P>
      <P>Phase one of the broadband programme will see 19 towns, many in the Border, midlands and west region targeted immediately. Metropolitan area fibre-optic networks will be built in these towns to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide &ldquo;always on&rdquo; low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda.</P>
      <P>The first phase is being conducted in association with local and regional authorities which will receive 90% funding from the Exchequer. A total of &euro;44 million is allocated this year in the Department of Public Enterprise Vote for this measure, which should be completed in full next year at a full cost of &euro;60 million.</P>
      <P>Phase two will witness the expansion of broadband networks in the remaining 48 towns. This will be completed through a public private partnership and involve investment of approximately &euro;100 million. Phase two should be completed within three years.</P>
      <P>Phase three, which is contingent on the success of the first two phases, will involve rolling out the programme to cover all 123 towns in the State with a population of 1,500 or over and the target date for completion is five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 20, 21, 34 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consideration by the Government last month of the report by Professor Rigas Doganis on aviation-tourism issues for the Department of the Taoiseach, I asked Aer Rianta to proceed, at the earliest possible date, with the provision of a rapid turnaround facility for aircraft at Dublin Airport, having particular regard <Col N="1020" /> to the planning permission already secured by the company for the proposed Pier D. Such a facility is to take full account of all carriers operating at the lower fares end of the market and the aim is to have the facility operational in time for the 2003 tourist season.</P>
    <P>Consultations are under way between Aer Rianta, the airlines and the relevant regulatory agencies to ensure the earliest possible provision of this new facility to appropriate standards, including security and immigration requirements.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these latter requirements in particular, it is clear the original Pier D specification will need some modification. All parties are discussing ways of minimising any delay in having the facility operational, but I cannot be more specific at this point.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to meet the chief executive of Ryanair. Senior management of Ryanair, along with other airlines and interested parties, are participating fully in advancing this issue in compliance with the recent Government decision on the matters.</P>
    <P>The question of further terminal capacity at Dublin Airport is kept under constant review by Aer Rianta which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the State airports and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers.</P>
    <P>The recent completion of the major extension to the terminal building at Dublin Airport has provided sufficient capacity to properly and safely handle up to 20 million passengers per annum compared to a throughput of 14.3 million passengers in 2001. Dublin Airport has, therefore, sufficient main terminal capacity to cater for growth for some years ahead. The additional pier to which I have referred above is designed to give greater turnaround flexibility to airlines as distinct from providing additional passenger terminal capacity.</P>
    <P>The concept of a second, independent terminal at Dublin Airport to compete with Aer Rianta's terminal facilities has been raised a number of occasions in recent times. As the Deputy is aware, I have stated on a number of previous occasions that I have not adopted any particular ideological position in relation to that concept. There are a number of complex considerations for and against this concept on which my Department has had advice on more than one occasion in recent years. Generally speaking, that advice did not confirm the value of a competing second terminal as a viable, proven concept.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Alan Dukes, while not ruling out the concept of separate terminal operations within Dublin Airport, decided in May 1997 that the proposal of Huntstown Airpark Limited relating to a private terminal development was not in the interests of the future development of the airport. He was persuaded that, from both an airport planning and economic point of view, the existing terminal complex should be developed to its maximum capacity <Col N="1021" /> before a second, remote location terminal is considered.</P>
    <P>In the most recent report of Professor Doganis, the latter stated that any suggestion of separating the management of one part of Dublin Airport from the rest is likely to create more problems than it would solve.</P>

      <P>BGE is obliged to ensure that extensions to the gas distribution network meet commercial viability criteria. While the closer a town is to the main transmission network the better are its chances of getting a gas service, BGE continuously reviews and evaluates towns at longer distances.</P>
      <P>BGE has announced that, within Connaught, Ballinasloe, Oranmore and Galway will get gas from the Ringmain. BGE has also confirmed that the board is actively considering connections to Castlebar, Westport, Tuam and Athenry from the proposed Mayo-Galway line.</P>
      <P>To the extent that towns might be supplied on the basis of an Exchequer grant, as in the case of Sligo and Ballina, this raises issues about EU State aid and procurement rules. My Department has already been in touch with Commission officials about this. The right to construct the line to Sligo, for example, will be established in a tendering process and this will be a precedent for any other grant-aided extensions.</P>

      <Quest>the number of times she has met the chairman of Aer Rianta, giving times and dates, since 11 September 2001; if she discussed the issue of a budget airline terminal at Shannon Airport; and, if so, the outcome of these discussions.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met the chairman of Aer Rianta, both formally and informally, on a number of occasions since 11 September, 2001. I have also had telephone conversations with him on,<i> inter alia,</i> matters concerning the State airports, the difficulties in the aviation sector generally and related matters. The issue of a budget airline ter<Col N="1023" /> minal at Shannon Airport was not the subject of discussion with the chairman.</P>
      <P>With the new terminal extension in Shannon Airport, which I opened in April 2000, Shannon now has capacity to cater for 4.5 million passengers per annum. Passenger throughput at Shannon last year was 2.4 million. Facilities now in place at Shannon can cater for passenger growth, both in relation to budget airlines and conventional carriers, for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Due to its high dependence on transatlantic traffic, the events of 11 September had a more immediate impact on traffic levels at Shannon as carriers responded to the US terrorist attacks with retrenchment and rationalisation programmes.</P>
      <P>To assist in stimulating the development of new routes following the events of 11 September, Aer Rianta increased the period for zero airport charges for new routes at Shannon, and at Cork, from three to four years. Aer Rianta has also offered to provide marketing support for route development promotional activities.</P>
      <P>New services are already coming on stream at Shannon which will assist the recovery of traffic levels at the airport. A new Ryanair service to Paris began on 14 February this year and Aer Arann commenced a Shannon-Dublin daily service on 11 March which it plans to increase to a twice daily service on 1 April. In addition, Skynet is scheduled to start a new Shannon-DublinWarsaw service at the end of April, while Air Canada will commence a Shannon-Dublin-Toronto service on 1 June.</P>
      <P>Despite the current difficulties for the aviation sector, I am confident that the future viability of our three State airports, including Shannon, is secure and that once confidence is fully restored in air travel, particularly among US citizens, our airports will continue to grow and prosper continuing their valuable contribution to national economic and regional development.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, a provision of &euro;200 million is available to support the communications and e-commerce measure. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. These include delivery of service in the south-east region by Chorus, ESBT and ESAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chorus project proposes a southern and eastern broadband communications corridor to <Col N="1024" /> provide broadband access to much of Leinster and Munster. The ESBT project proposes to install a national 48-fibre optic network, most of which is concentrated in the southern and eastern region. The Esat project proposes to extend its existing broadband fibre optic network from Cork to Clonakilty.</P>
    <P>A total of 31 submissions were received under the second call for proposals on the 19 October 2002. These submissions were independently evaluated and the results of evaluation were finalised at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>On foot of the evaluation a number of local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place in the next two months. These proposals involve the construction of metro area fibre optic networks in 19 towns around the country. Networks in other towns are under discussion with the relevant local authorities. Wexford, Waterford, Dungarvan, Carlow, Clonmel and Kilkenny are included in these 19 towns.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Government strategy which I announced on 8 March last, a second phase of 48 additional towns will be pursued through a public private partnership model. Phase 1 and phase 2 encompasses 67 towns throughout the country, 37 of which are in the south and east region. Phase three will involve rolling out the programme to cover all 123 towns in the State.</P>

      <P>I fully support the major development programme planned by Aer Rianta for Cork Airport which, the company informs me, will cost in excess of &euro;100 million. It is recognised that the facilities at Cork are stretched, particularly at peak periods, and that further investment to cater for current passenger throughput and for future growth in passenger numbers is now urgently required.</P>
      <P>This major investment programme consists of a terminal building with capacity to cater for three million passengers per annum, a multi-storey car park with covered access to the terminal, airbridges, the provision of hold baggage screening facilities and a control tower, which will be equipped by the Irish Aviation Authority. I understand that consultants are preparing the detailed design specifications and the project is expected to go to tender in May with the work expected to commence in the autumn.</P>

      <P>It is accepted that renewable energies need special support to operate successfully in the internal electricity market. In Ireland the support measure is a power purchase agreement, PPA, between a producer and the ESB obliging the latter to purchase the output from nominated new renewable energy based electricity generating stations at guaranteed prices for up to 15 years. Possession of a PPA enables producers to raise the necessary finance to build projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1999 I published a challenging target to increase electricity generating plant using renewable energies by an additional 500 <Col N="1026" /> MW by 2005. The European Commission has determined the necessary PPAs constitute state aid. A requirement of the state aids clearance is that successful projects be selected by competitive tendering to ensure the state aid is the minimum necessary.</P>
    <P>In February last I announced the results of the most recent competitive tender round, AER V. Originally I had signalled my intention to support up to 255 megawatts, MW, of plant. Due to the quality of applications submitted I increased the support to 363 MW.</P>
    <P>In the wind energy categories the original target was 240 MW. In the event, I conditionally accepted 40 projects, amounting to 354 MW, of which approximately 330 MW was bid below the price cap offered to the market. I do not accept, therefore, the maximum price offered is too low where I am bound by EU rules to accept the lowest compliant competitive bids for the award of state aid.</P>

When the remaining 12 DART cars are in service, which will allow the operation of all six car DART trains at peak hour, the capacity of the DART system will have increased by almost 50% since 2000. The next phase of the DART upgrade project will be works to facilitate the operation of eight car DART trains at peak hour. <Col N="1027" /> This phase will involve an upgrade in the overhead power capacity, platform extensions and the purchase of a further 36 DART cars.

      <P>Under the airports measure of the national development plan, a sum of &euro;13.97 million, at 1999 prices, was allocated to assist with necessary infrastructural upgrades and improvements at the six regional airports. This amount was apportioned as &euro;10.16 million in respect of the four airports in the BMW region, namely Donegal, Galway, Knock and Sligo, and &euro;3.81million in respect of the two airports in the south and east region, Kerry and Waterford. A further &euro;3.81 million was subsequently allocated to the south and east region, bringing the total allocation for that region to &euro;7.62 million and the overall total under the measure to &euro;17.78 million.</P>
      <P>Expenditure to date under this measure amounts to less than &euro;1 million of which Waterford Regional Airport received approximately &euro;55,000 towards the cost of fire and safety equipment. Following a number of queries raised by my Department on their initial proposals, the authorities at Waterford Airport have submitted further information and clarification on their project proposals, which include proposals in relation to hangars, an apron extension, navigational aids and airfield lighting, fire safety and rescue equipment, screening equipment and car-parking improvements.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for my Department to undertake a very thorough assessment of the requests for funding from all the regional airports, as the overall amount sought exceeds the total amount available under the NDP. My Department is finalising this assessment and I expect to be in a position to make decisions in this regard in the coming weeks.</P>

However, I am informed by FÁS that when it funded the third course run by this company, there were only three participants from the north-west region with the majority of participants mainly from the Dublin area. As the Dublin region has extensive drug rehabilitation projects supported and run by FÁS, including a number of equestrian type projects which would be willing to take additional people, FÁS has recommended that the clients involved should be referred to similar projects in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>I travelled to New York on 9 December 2001 to promote Ireland's largest international craft and gift fair, Showcase 2002, at the request of the Crafts Council of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. The purpose of the visit was to promote Showcase 2002 among North American buyers. I returned to Ireland the following day, 10 December.</P>
      <P>In 2001, 550 North American buyers visited Showcase 2002. Following the foot and mouth disease crisis last year and the atrocities of 11 September in the US it was felt that an even greater effort than usual was required to promote attendance at Showcase 2002, as it was feared that fewer Americans would travel to visit or to buy from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2002, 485 North American buyers attended Showcase &ndash; down 12% on 2001. The quality of the buyer was reported to be high and the expec<Col N="1029" /> tation is that the revenue generated for Irish companies and the new products bought by the American shops will be similar to 2001, notwithstanding the reduction in the number of buyers attending.</P>
    <P>The following people accompanied me on board the Government jet: Mr. Oliver O'Connor, special adviser; Ms Catherine Dardis, personal assistant; Ms Bridget Flynn, private secretary; Dr. Frances Ruane, chairperson, Crafts Council of Ireland; Ms Renagh Holohan, journalist, <i>The Irish Times; </i>Mr. Gerry O'Connor, journalist, INN; Mr. Gene McKenna, journalist, <i>Irish Independent; </i>and Ms Carol Coleman, journalist with RTE, joined the delegation in New York.</P>

    <P>As can be seen from the table the counties located in the eastern part of the country have traditionally out-performed counties located in the BMW &ndash; Border, midlands, west &ndash; region in terms of job creation. However, in recent times IDA Ireland has placed a greater emphasis on developing and creating new investment in the BMW region. The establishment of the MBNA project in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, is a direct result of this renewed focus and is reflected in a significant increase in the level of new jobs created in County Leitrim in the year 2001.</P>
    <P>As part of IDA's strategy on regional development, the agency is committed to placing 50% of all new investment in the BMW region, which means doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for this region. IDA is focusing particularly on attracting medical devices, ICT, engin<Col N="1030" /> eering and internationally traded services-software sectors to the region.</P>
    <P>IDA has headquartered national responsibilities for health care property and regional development in Athlone, bringing the total staff complement to 35 people. The agency has also relocated staff from international services and consumer products divisions from Dublin to Sligo, bringing the staff complement there up to 15. The purpose of these moves is to drive growth from within the regions, and to develop the BMW region as a magnet for growth and investment.</P>
    <P>The changes in policy which have occurred have also involved intensive and radically changed marketing approaches by the IDA team working in close partnership with the local authorities and the third level colleges and universities across the country. Despite the ongoing retrenchment in the US economy, which is the source of a significant proportion of overseas investment, IDA continues to strive towards maintaining this level of investment in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>However, improved access is crucial to attracting new overseas investment to the regions and in this context the importance of improved air and road access cannot be over emphasised. This has been recognised in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which includes plans to bring our roads, railway and air services up to a standard consistent with a modern economy within the next four years. Availability of high quality telecommunications and energy supplies are also essential. IDA Ireland will keep in close contact with relevant infrastructure providers to ensure they are aware of IDA's priorities.</P>

      <P>Applications for work permits in respect of the persons concerned were received on 5 March 2002. It is the policy of the Department to process applications for work permits strictly in the order in which they are received. Assuming the applications are completed correctly and are otherwise in order, processing time will take approximately ten weeks from the date of receipt of the applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The processing time for work permits is directly related to the number of work permit applications received. The number of applications increased from an average of more than 350 per week in 2000 to more than 825 per week last year. The level of applications climbed during the year and in December alone, an unprecedented 5,690 applications were received. New procedures were introduced with effect from 2 January 2002 and <Col N="1031" /> this has resulted, at least temporarily, in a reduction in the number of applications received.</P>
    <P>While the staff numbers in the work permit section was increased by 50% last year in an effort to reduce processing time, the very large increase in applications meant the waiting period could not be reduced. Nevertheless, the staff in the section issued 36,436 permits in 2001, compared with 18,000 in the year 2000.</P>

The corresponding outturn for 2001 was &euro;3.474 million. There were no cutbacks impacting on departmental consultancy expenditure plans for 2002. Estimate allocations approved for agencies operating under the aegis of the Department do not identify specific amounts for consultancy projects. It is a matter for each agency to determine its programme spending priorities having regard to its Estimate allocation and any other income.</P>

      <P>In August 2000 I indicated my intention to increase the statutory financial limits on deposits with, and loans by, specially authorised loan societies, SALS, subject to each society agreeing to the terms of a supervisory agreement on a voluntary basis. The supervisory agreement was considered necessary given the limited regulatory powers available to the Registrar of Friendly Societies in regard to SALS and the proposed increase in the financial limits.</P>
      <P>The delay in proceeding with the regulations giving effect to the increased limits is due to the delay in one of the registered SALS agreeing to the terms of the supervisory agreement and the heavy workload of the Parliamentary Counsel's office. The draft regulations increasing the statutory financial limits were sent to the Office of the Attorney General for settling in September 2001. I received the settled draft regulations from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel last week.</P>
      <P>The draft regulations were laid before each House of the Oireachtas earlier this week. Under the provisions of the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Act, 1977, each House must pass a resolution approving the regulations in draft form. It is my hope that the necessary resolution will be passed by each House before the Easter recess. When both Houses pass the resolution, I intend to sign the regulations bringing the increased limits into effect.</P>

      <P>The special scheme to which the Deputy refers was approved by the EU Commission as a once-off measure to regularise the position of fishing vessels which were part of the Irish fishing fleet prior to 1990 but which for various reasons had not been licensed and registered. To date tonnage has been approved under the scheme in respect of 762 vessels, involving a total of 2,169 gross registered tonnes. Some 500 of these vessels so far have been entered on the Irish and EU fishing boat registers. This information is not readily available on a yearly basis. There are 170 further applications which have not provided evidence of full compliance with the relevant conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Only vessels which complied with the terms of the special scheme, which closed in February 1995, could be granted tonnage from what was a provisional overall allocation provided by the EU Commission in this regard. The Commission decision on the multi-annual guidance programme, MGP, for Ireland provides that when all applications under the scheme have been processed, the capacity objectives of our polyvalent fleet segment will be revised accordingly.</P>
      <P>All fishing vessels engaged in commercial sea fishing, including those under 12 metres in length, are legally required to be licensed and registered. For Ireland to comply with its binding MGP fleet capacity limits the current legal position is that 100% replacement capacity must be provided before a vessel can be licensed and registered. The Deputy will be aware, however, that I am seeking EU approval for amendments to the scheme for the licensing of inshore vessels so that owners of vessels under 12 metres would have to provide only 50% replacement capacity in the context of the possible creation of a separate new inshore segment.</P>

    <P>The core objectives of the programme are to enhance the safety, quality and competitiveness of the whitefish fleet and to improve working <Col N="1036" /> conditions and product handling and quality through the following schemes: the introduction of new vessels; the introduction of modern second-hand vessels; the modernisation of existing vessels; the purchase and installation of safety equipment and the special assistance for young fishermen and women acquiring their first vessel.</P>

      <P>In developing its priorities for the national development plan, my Department, in consultation with the Marine Institute, has identified the lack of an adequate coastal infrastructure provision as a key development constraint to water-based tourism and leisure, and the most serious obstacle to development as being the lack of service infrastructure in coastal regions in terms of serviceable harbours, piers, slipways and moorings.</P>
      <P>As a result, the improvement of access infrastructure in coastal and estuarine areas has been targeted by my Department as the primary focus for development under the marine tourism sub-measure which will be implemented by my Department as part of the two regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. In pursuing this policy, it is intended that investment in infrastructure will concentrate on providing facilities in coastal areas which have suffered from under-investment in the past and which have the potential to provide either new, or enhanced, recreational infrastructure to facilitate activities like general boating, angling and water sports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the primary responsibility for development of the inland waterways now rests with the North-South body, <Col N="1037" /> Waterways Ireland, and the provision of grant aid for such development would be a matter for that body in the first instance. </P>

      <P>Details of Ireland Aid spending over the years, including specific locations and amounts of grants allocated, are outlined in the Ireland Aid annual reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. These reports, the latest of which is for 2000, also give a comprehensive outline of the overall sectoral and geographic focus of the aid programme. It should be noted that, under UN and OECD guidelines, grants for projects in a number of eastern European countries, including Romania, are classified as &ldquo;official aid&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;official development assistance&rdquo;; aid given by Ireland to Romania is not taken into account when calculating the total amount of ODA disbursed.</P>
      <P>For convenience, I am forwarding separately to the Deputy the last three published reports. The Annual Report for 2001 will be published later this year. Provisional outturns for 2001 indicate that &euro;184,112 was allocated in direct bilateral aid for projects in Romania. The breakdown of this allocation was as follows. Under the stability pact process, Ireland Aid has funded the International Organisation for Migration, IOM, counter human-trafficking programme in Romania since its inception in 2000. The programme builds on assistance provided by the international community to victims of human trafficking by providing an inter-agency referral system offering reintegration options. The programme is focused primarily on the trafficking of women and girls, many of whom are in their early teens. Ireland Aid support for this programme in 2001 amounted to &euro;158,717.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" />Funding of &euro;25,395 was approved in 2001 in support of a European Women's Foundation democracy project aimed at women in Latvia, Romania, and Moldova. The overall aim of the project is to build civil society and democracy in these countries, by bringing to groups of motivated women knowledge and skills of: building civil and political society; using the free media; the rights of citizens in a democracy; and founding and running self-help organisations.</P>
    <P>In addition to this direct assistance, Ireland also allocates resources to a number of trust funds which operate in the region. In 2001, &euro;431,710 was allocated to the Irish general consultancy trust fund, CTF, of the World Bank for activities in the countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS. Also, in 2001 Ireland contributed &euro;253,948 to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, trust fund. These funds were used to finance work by Irish consultants and firms on technical assistance, training and advisory activities and to further the economic transition process and development of the institutional infrastructure within eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Aid to Romania has at all times been allocated in line with Ireland Aid aims and objectives. Built-in reporting requirements for projects supported by Ireland Aid have indicated that Ireland's bilateral assistance to Romania has been effective and of a high standard.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a number of representations about this case. We have raised our concerns about the matter with the British Government through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on a number of occasions. In October 2000, we were informed by the British authorities that the individual to whom the wallet belonged was a serving member of the Royal Irish Regiment and that he had been subjected to internal disciplinary proceedings. According to the information received, the matter was investigated by the military police who reported that the individual in question had no subversive links. As a result, the RUC was not asked to become involved in the case. We were also informed at that stage that the investigation had been concluded.</P>
      <P>In light of further representations, we have once again raised this matter with the British authorities. We have been informed that the Police Ombudsman is investigating a complaint about the police action in this case and that the British Government will not comment further until this investigation is complete.</P>

      <P>An allocation of &euro;279, 000 is provided under subhead A7 in respect of consultancy for the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Vote 38, for 2002. This is slightly less than the allocation for 2001 which included a once-off provision of &euro;32,000 in respect of the upgrade of the Department's payroll system.</P>
      <P>Funding of &euro;12.44 million and &euro;3.83 million has been provided in this year's Estimates for the development of a new and more secure passport production system and the upgrade of the Department's IT and communications networks, respectively. Included in these provisions are amounts to cover the cost of consultancies in respect of each project.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, the sum of &euro;23,900 as fees and &euro;15,650 as expenses was approved for 2002 for a consultant engaged by my Department as a programme manager for the Irish College in Paris. There is no cutback as compared to 2001.</P>
      <P>The contract of a cultural programme co-ordinator who in 2001 received &euro;45,766.44 as salary and &euro;12,584.36 as expenses, has not been renewed in 2002 as a consequence of budgetary cutbacks.</P>
      <P>It has not been necessary to postpone any capital projects as a result of budgetary cutbacks.</P>
      <P>The development co-operation division commissions a significant number of consultancies, funding for which is provided for under subhead A7 of Vote 39. The approved budget for this subhead for 2002 is &euro;1.893 million, comprising fees of &euro;1.580 million and expenses of &euro;313,000. There have been no cutbacks, postponements or cancellations in the programme of consultancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultancies cover a broad range of disciplines, with particular emphasis on appraisal and evaluation of development programmes.

    <P>A number of entities operate under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs. These include the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, the National Committee for Development Education, NCDE, and the Irish Aid Advisory Committee, IAAC.</P>
    <P>In the case of APSO, provision was made in their 2002 estimates for &euro;126,974 for research and evaluation consultancies to take place during 2002. APSO consultancies have not been impacted by any cutbacks. The consultancies under consideration by APSO at present are routine evaluations of overseas aid programmes.</P>
    <P>The NCDE has made provision of &euro;393,858 for consultancies in their 2002 Estimates. These consultancies planned for 2002 include the following areas: education, research, training, capacity building, communications, information and evaluation. NCDE consultancies have not been impacted by any cutbacks.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent television programme concerning the orphanage in Negravoda, and the distressing conditions there which the film revealed. My officials have been in contact with the European Commission Directorate General for Enlargement, which is responsible for pre-accession funding for Romania, regarding allegations that EU funds are being provided to orphanages in which children are not treated properly.</P>
      <P>As regards the adequacy of controls, the Commission noted in its response that it is aware of the situation and is monitoring it closely. As part of the pre-accession process, the Commission conducts an ongoing review of the progress made by each accession country based on a number of economic, social and political criteria set by the European Council, and publishes regular reports based on concrete measures which have actually been taken by the state. In its most recent regular report on Romania's progress towards accession, published in November 2001, the Commission outlined a number of important steps which have been taken by the Government of Romania to improve the child welfare system. These include the establishment of a national agency for the protection of children's rights; the adoption of normative standards and levels of care for child care services; the adoption of a national strategy on the reform of the child care system and an increase in the level of funding provided in the national budget for child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" />In addition to the steps outlined above, an important element of the overall approach is that a number of older orphanages will be closed this year, and children will be moved to smaller-scale facilities with better conditions. The Commission's view is that, in general, conditions in Romanian orphanages have improved in the past few years, and the Government of Romania has shown a political commitment to address the situation in orphanages as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>The Commission has provided considerable funds to support child welfare in pre-accession countries. The 1999 PHARE Programme for Child Welfare Reform, which has a budget of &euro;25 million, is supporting over a hundred projects on child welfare in Romania that are being implemented by local authorities and non-governmental organisations. A further &euro;10 million in funding for child welfare will follow under the 2001 PHARE programme.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that EU funds are being used effectively to support the reform of the child welfare system, and to deliver permanent improvements in the conditions of children resident in orphanages in Romania.</P>

      <P>Under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 2000, Bord Gáis Éireann has statutory responsibility to develop and maintain an efficient and cost effective gas transmission and distribution system. Extensions to the transmission system require my consent whereas extensions of the distribution network fall exclusively within the day to day responsibilities of the board.</P>
      <P>The commercial criteria that BGE apply to potential new connections to the natural gas network are primarily driven by the distance of the town from the transmission network and the projected gas load from housing and industrial-commercial customers. The company endeavours to ascertain the current and future projected gas load for the towns, and regularly update these figures by liaising with interested local parties such as building contractors and the county councils.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by Bord Gáis that it is actively considering connections to towns from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline, which include Castlebar and Westport. As the Deputy is aware the Government decided in principle in September 2001 to extend the gas transmission system to Sligo via Ballina. Crossmolina is one of a number of towns being looked at afresh in this context.</P>

      <P>Policy on public transport for greater Dublin area in the period 2000-16 is set out in the Dublin Transportation Office's long-term transportation strategy, A Platform for Change. This strategy aims to reduce growth in the demand for transport, particularly for private transport, and to reduce the need for car commuting by improving the reliability, availability and quality of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress to date is as follows. The Railway Procurement Agency, established on 28 December 2001, is responsible for the procurement of the Luas and metro projects. Construction of the light rail lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green is progressing. The lines are still on target for completion by end 2003. The depot at Red Cow is now completed and fitting-out is taking place. Seven trams have been delivered so far and are at the depot undergoing initial testing. Work on laying a test track from the depot to Kingswood in Tallaght has begun and it is expected that track testing will commence next month. The trams are continuing to arrive at the rate of two per month. Connex has been selected as the preferred bidder to operate the system and the contract for <Col N="1046" /> operating the system will be finalised shortly by the Railway Procurement Agency.</P>
    <P>In January, the Government approved the commencement of the procurement process for phase 1 of the Dublin metro. The metro is being developed as a public private partnership and the Government has approved a policy framework for rail-based PPP, which will be used in the implementation of the metro project. The Railway Procurement Agency is carrying out passenger modelling and route alignment studies on the proposed metro route. The procurement process commenced yesterday with the Railway Procurement Agency issuing a notice seeking expressions of interest from potential partners in the private sector.</P>
    <P>In regard to DART and suburban rail, maynooth service commenced in early August 2001 using 20 new diesel rail cars purchased specifically for the route; this represents more than 100% increase in service. Some 26 new DART cars are in service since November 2000 and 12 DART cars delivered in October 2001 are to enter service in the coming week; increasing capacity of the DART by almost 50% in two years. Design and geotechnical work is in progress in relation to the Kildare corridor and DART upgrade projects. Work on upgrading of Heuston Station has commenced and extra platform capacity has been provided. A new station at Monasterevin station opened in October 2001. Platforms at suburban rail stations have been lengthened and all Dublin outer suburban stations can now cater for eight-car trains. Some 80 diesel rail cars for suburban services will begin to be delivered later this year. Further construction work on Heuston Station track and signalling project, at a cost of &euro;117 million, is continuing. Construction work has commenced on a new Drogheda diesel rail depot.</P>
    <P>Nine QBCs are now in operation &ndash; Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, North Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght and Swords and Blanchardstown &ndash; resulting in bus journey times being cut in some cases by up to 40%. The Stillorgan QBC has shown that buses can attract people out of private cars, with peak period passenger numbers up by 150%. The Ballymun QBC is to be launched shortly and will provided increased and improved services to commuters on the northside of Dublin. Extension of the Stillorgan QBC is planned and six of the existing QBCs have already been reviewed in order to identify areas for improvement to provide improved services. To speed up implementation of quality bus corridors, a QBC project team led by the director of traffic, Dublin Corporation, is being established to speed up the QBC delivery.</P>
    <P>An additional 242 buses and 194 replacement buses were delivered up to end of 2001. A further 53 replacement buses are proposed for 2002. In 2000, 40 new buses were deployed in the greater Dublin area and a further 34 in 2001. Further <Col N="1047" /> development of Bus Áras and passenger facilities is planned for 2002.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that better integration of public transport in the city is of major importance. To this end, a total of &euro;63.5million has been set aside to promote integration in a practical way. This will be used to provide an extra 3,700 park and ride places. This is in addition to around 2,700 places, which will be provided under existing Dublin Transportation Office plans, by the end of this year. These are mainly at suburban rail stations where sites are more readily available. I twill also be used to develop interchange facilities which will make it easier to transfer from bus to bus or from one mode to another, and to introduce integrated ticketing based on a contactless smartcard based system. The new Railway Procurement Agency has been mandated with the delivery of a national scheme of integrated ticketing for public transport, initially in the greater Dublin area. Approximately &euro;3.7 million will be earmarked specifically for integrated ticketing in the current year.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus and Irish Rail are in the process of upgrading ticketing equipment that will allow for the use of smartcard technologies on the basis of smartcard technology, so that, in addition to the interchangeability of tickets between bus and DART, there will also be interchangeability with Luas.</P>
    <P>The following will also be used to develop real time passenger information systems as part of a wider strategy in providing accessible and quality information to the public on the actual movements of bus and rail mode public transport vehicles. At the request of the Department, the Dublin Transportation Office has also established a committee to develop real time passenger information.</P>

      <P>I have recently signed a statutory order, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, requiring the Railway Procurement Agency to procure a national scheme of integrated ticketing for public transport services with initial deployment in the greater Dublin area. In addition, I have made up to &euro;3.7 million available to the agency for the project in the current year.</P>
      <P>Integrated ticketing for all public transport modes is to be introduced by way of contactless smartcard technology and is being developed in consultation with the general public and transport operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of the project will be introduced in conjunction with the new Luas services in 2003. Commuters will be able to switch effortlessly between some Dublin Bus and Luas services without the need to queue to purchase extra tick<Col N="1048" /> ets. The rest of this integrated ticketing system will be rolled out within two years thereafter.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, there have been a number of ticketing initiatives and improvements introduced by CIE to improve customer service. For example, intending passengers can now purchase Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and Bus Éireann tickets over the Internet: benefit-in-kind provisions for prepaid annual commuter tickets have been introduced for public sector workers and highly flexible bus and rail rambler tickets have also been introduced. Irish Rail, with a view to further facilitating customers, will be installing new ticket vending machines at a number of suburban rail stations later this year.</P>

      <P>It is accepted that renewable energies need special support to operate successfully in the internal electricity market. In Ireland the support measure is a power purchase agreement, PPA, between a producer and the ESB obliging the latter to purchase the output from nominated new renewable energy based electricity generating stations at guaranteed prices for up to fifteen years. Possession of a PPA enables producers to raise the necessary finance to build projects. Under this support measure there are 22 wind farms in commercial operation around the country with a total installed capacity of 124 megawatts.</P>
      <P>In February last I announced the results of the most recent competitive tender round, AER V. Originally I had signalled my intention to support up to 255 MW of plant. Due to the quality of applications submitted I increased the support to 363 MW. In the wind energy categories the original target was 240 MW. In the event I conditionally accepted 40 wind energy projects amounting to 354 MW.</P>
      <P>AER V was the first occasion where planning permission for the proposed project was a condition of entry. This must increase the likelihood of projects proceeding to commercial operation. In addition I have already indicated I will shortly announce a further competition, AER VI, to deliver my overall demanding target of an additional 500 MW of new generating plant based on renewable energy technologies by 2005.</P>
      <P>The work I have set in train will see historic levels of progress in the wind energy sector over the next two years.</P>

      <Quest>the level of State and private invest ment in broadband infrastructure to date; the likely investment over the next five to ten years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In a fully liberalised market it is a matter in the first instance for the private sector operators to invest in appropriate broadband infrastructure and services. Arising, however, from initiatives introduced by me since 1999, the following is the estimated level of public and private investment in broadband infrastructure over the next five to ten years.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, &euro;26 million was made available to support the rollout of broadband to the regions. This measure resulted in a total investment of &euro;70 million in communications infrastructure. The amount available for investment in communications infrastructure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. Under the first call for proposals &euro;55 million was made available resulting in a total investment of &euro;130 million, now under way.</P>
      <P>On 8 March 2002 I announced a major drive to bring high speed broadband access to 67 priority towns around the country. Phase one of the broadband programme will see 19 towns, many in the Border, midlands and west &ndash; BMW &ndash; region targeted immediately. Metropolitan area fibre optic networks will be built in these towns to link up with the existing backbone network in the country. The town links will facilitate consumers, educational establishments, industry and business and provide always on low cost and high speed Internet access which will drive the Government's e-commerce agenda.</P>
      <P>The first phase is being conducted in association with local and regional authorities which will receive 90% funding from the NDP. A total of &euro;44 million is allocated this year in the Department of Public Enterprise Vote for this measure. The estimated cost of phase one is &euro;60 million. Phase two will involve the expansion of broadband networks in the remaining 48 towns. This will be completed through a public private partnership and involve a total investment of approximately &euro;100 million. Phase two should be completed within three years. The Government will seek to maximise private sector involvement in this phase.</P>
      <P>Phase three, which is contingent on the success of the first two phases, will involve rolling out the programme to cover all 123 towns in the State with a population of 1,500 or over and the target date for completion is five years. It is estimated that phase three will involve an additional investment of &euro;100 million. The Government also intends to maximise private sector involvement in this phase.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of studies have been carried out which have looked at the prospects for developing or upgrading rail services in the Limerick, Shannon, Galway and Sligo areas. In addition, I am aware of proposals for developing a western rail corridor which would link Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Cork. These rail proposals will be examined in the context of the strategic rail study which I recently announced. The study is designed to provide the Government with a basis for a strategic framework for the development of rail services over the next 20 years and establish priorities for investment. As part of a public consultation process on the subject matter of the study, I have recently invited the general public and interested parties to make submissions to my Department in that regard. I have received no proposals from CIE or Iarnród Éireann for the closure of any part of the railway network.</P>

      <P>On 27 July 2001, the Government approved an equity injection of &euro;12.7 million to An Post, spread over two years, to ensure that a network of post offices can be maintained throughout the State, delivering a range of services, particularly access to Government services. The approval of the European Commission was requested to the equity injection under Article 86(2) of the treaty which provides that competition rules shall not be used to obstruct the performance of undertakings providing services of general economic interest. The provision of working capital for An Post by the State is permitted in national legislation under section 31 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. The European Commission recently indicated that it is proposed to approve the equity injection on the basis of the submission by the State.</P>

      <Quest>her plans to change the rule requiring all regional airport flights to be routed through Dublin to qualify for PSO funding in view of the congestion which is growing in Dublin and the need to abandon plans to build another runway at Dublin Airport.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no rule, as such, which requires our public service obligation flights to be routed to Dublin. As I pointed out on Friday last at the Select Committee on Public Enterprise, our six PSO routes link the regional airports in Kerry, Galway, Sligo, Knock, Donegal and Derry with Dublin because most of the people using these services, including business and tourism interests, want fast, reliable access to the capital city either to do business in Dublin or to connect with onward flights from Dublin Airport to overseas destinations. The PSO regime, which is supported by the Exchequer, exists to serve the needs of the travelling public and to promote the development of the regions concerned.</P>
      <P>The recent completion of the major extension of the terminal building at Dublin Airport has provided sufficient capacity to handle up to 20 million passengers per annum compared to a throughput of 14.3 million passengers in 2001. The optimisation of movements on the runway at Dublin Airport, particularly at peak periods, is now a matter for the Commission for Aviation Regulation which has engaged Airports Co-ordination Limited to co-ordinate landing and take off slots at Dublin.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the State airports, including Dublin Airport, and provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers. Notwithstanding the very welcome increase in traffic at Shannon and Cork airports in recent years and to a lesser extent at the regional airports, Dublin Airport is the country's main airport serving the needs, not just of the travelling public in our capital city and surrounding areas, but of the country's tourism, business and freight sectors generally.</P>
      <P>While the nature and timing of any additions to infrastructural capacity, including runway capacity, at Dublin Airport is subject to ongoing review by Aer Rianta, it is prudent for the company to continue to plan for the future, particularly given the long lead times for major projects. Any proposal to proceed with another runway at Dublin Airport will, of course, be subject to planning permission being obtained.</P>

      <P>In March 1999, London Economics published Irish Energy Efficiency Policy for the period 2000 to 2005, a report to the Energy Advisory Board. Included in this report was an econometric analysis of comparative energy efficiency among OECD countries, allowing for factors such as differing income levels and energy prices in each country. Based on the results of this analysis, the report authors &ldquo;find no evidence that taken as a whole any sector of the Irish economy is inefficient in its use of energy by international standards&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the past decade Ireland has made considerable progress in reducing its primary energy intensity, which provides an indication of the energy productivity of the whole economy. This is due largely to structural changes in the economy and energy efficiency measures. Primary energy intensity is defined for a given year as the ratio between total energy consumption and economic output &ndash; GDP.</P>
      <P>The figures in the following table are quoted in TOE &ndash; tonnes of oil equivalent &ndash; per 000 95US$. The GDP data have been scaled up or down to the price levels of 1995 and then converted to US$ using average yearly 1995 rates.</P>

      <P>The report which appeared in the 24 March edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> referred to BNFL's response to the recent UK consultation document on radioactive waste management. According to the report, BNFL, in its response to the consultation document, informed the UK authorities that in order for BNFL to deal with the high level liquid waste stored in tanks at Sellafield and render it safe in the long-term by a process of vitrification or solidification, it will be necessary to increase discharges into the environment in the short-term.</P>
      <P>The Government is totally opposed to radioactive discharges from Sellafield. It is also concerned from the safety viewpoint about the storage of the high level waste in liquid form in tanks at Sellafield and has been pressing the UK authorities for some years now to accelerate the current process of vitrifying the waste. This waste arises from the nuclear spent fuel reprocessing activities at Sellafield to which we are also totally opposed.</P>
      <P>Any increases in radioactive discharges would be contrary to the commitment entered into in 1998 by the OSPAR contracting parties when they adopted the OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances. That strategy has as its objective the virtual elimination of radioactive discharges by the year 2020 and commits the contracting parties, which include the UK, to progressive and substantial reductions in such discharges for meeting this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the storage tanks themselves, the RPII concluded in its report, published in February 2000, of its examination of the safety related documentation relating to the storage tanks that &ldquo;the risks associated with the storage of waste in liquid <Col N="1054" /> form be minimised as soon as possible by increasing the rate of vitrification or decreasing the output of the Magnox or Thorp reprocessing plants, or by a combination of both&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I reject any suggestion that an increase in the rate of vitrification justifies an increase in radioactive discharges. The liquid waste arises from BNFL's reprocessing activities and BNFL's current vitrification capacity is not capable of keeping pace with the volume of liquid waste arising. As far as the Government is concerned, BNFL, in order to implement the speedy vitrification of the backlog of liquid waste and prevent further hazardous waste, should cease its reprocessing activities immediately. The Government will continue to pursue all realistic means, both diplomatic and legal, to bring about the cessation of operations at Sellafield, including the reprocessing operations.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>the extent to which targets including costs set by her Department in the context of the national development plan have been achieved or are achievable; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10852/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position in relation to allocations and the achievement of targeted expenditure under the national development plan in the transport, energy and communications areas.</P>
      <P>During the seven years of the national development plan, it is proposed to invest &euro;2.8 billion in public transport. The greater Dublin area will benefit from a &euro;2.03 billion investment and &euro;825 million has been allocated under the NDP proposals to address regional transport requirements. Significant progress has already been made in achieving these targets. More than &euro;570 million in Exchequer funding has already been spent on projects since the commencement of the plan and a further &euro;424 million has been allocated to public transport projects in 2002. This investment has already resulted in additional capacity on both bus and rail network and greater frequency of bus and rail services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the railway safety programme is progressing with more than 246 miles of track and more than 150 miles of fencing completed, 228 bridges renewed and safety improvements on more than 401 level crossings. Work has commenced on the development of Heuston Station which will see an expansion of the station facilities and its capacity to accommodate increased frequency of mainline and suburban trains with five extra platforms, signalling and improved passenger facilities. This investment will also form part of the Kildare line upgrade <Col N="1055" /> where the intention is to have a four track line to allow both suburban and mainline trains run independently of each other.</P>
    <P>The upgrade of the DART line is also under way and will result in greater frequency of trains and again increased capacity in and out of Connolly Station. This development will also benefit the users of the Maynooth rail line. On the suburban rail network, DART capacity will have increased by about 50% when the further 12 DART carriages that are currently being commissioned enter into service shortly after Easter.</P>
    <P>Progress on the construction of Luas is continuing and is on schedule for completion before the end of 2003. The depot at the Red Cow is now complete, enabling work is well advanced and track laying and overhead cabling work commenced in the past few weeks. Seven of the 40 trams have been delivered to date with the remainder arriving at the rate of two a month. The preferred bidder for the operation of the system and contract terms are being finalised.</P>
    <P>The Railway Procurement Agency is continuing with the preparatory work for the commencement of the procurement process for the Dublin metro. The Government has approved a phased approach to the development of the metro and a notice seeking expressions of interest will be placed in the EU Official Journal shortly. My Department, in conjunction with CIE, is monitoring the progress of projects being funded under the national development plan and taking the necessary steps, where possible, to ensure that projects are completed within budget and in the agreed timeframe.</P>
    <P>Under the airports measure of the national development plan, a sum of &euro;13.97 million in 1999 prices was allocated to assist with necessary infrastructural upgrades and improvements at the six regional airports. This amount was apportioned as &euro;10.16 million in respect of the four airports in the Border, midland and western region and &euro;3.81 million in respect of the two airports in the south and east region. A further sum of &euro;3.81 million was subsequently allocated to the south and east region, bringing the total allocation for that region to &euro;7.62 million and the overall total under the Measure to &euro;17.78 million. Expenditure to date under the airports measure amounts to less than &euro;1 million mainly on fire rescue equipment and navigational aids.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for my Department to undertake a very thorough assessment of the requests for funding from all the regional airports, as the overall amount sought exceeds the total amount available under the national development plan. My Department is currently finalising this assessment and I expect to be in a position to make decisions in this regard in the coming weeks. I am confident the projects which are selected for support under the airports measure can be completed within the overall time frame of the plan.</P>
    <P>Under the sustainable energy priority within the framework of the national development plan <Col N="1056" />&euro;222.5 million is earmarked for investment. My Department has overall responsibility for the administration of this funding and the Irish Energy Centre, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is the main conduit for implementing this priority. Recently enacted legislation, the Sustainable Energy Act, 2002, provides for the centre to be established as an independent statutory body with the new title of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the energy sector, a key priority in the national development plan is to identify those areas of expenditure which will assist Ireland in complying with its obligation under the Kyoto protocol, which is to limit the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by 13% above 1990 levels. The strategy is to pursue least cost approaches to achieving more sustainable energy services and systems. The focus of the strategy being pursued is on energy efficiency, conservation and the promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources. The Department's policy is fully elaborated in the Green Paper on sustainable energy, which was published by the Minister of State in September 1999.</P>
    <P>The primary implementing body for energy efficiency is the Irish Energy Centre and much of the emphasis over the early part of the NDP has been on building capacity in the centre to enable it to deliver the ambitious plans foreseen in the NDP. Sanction has been received for an approximate doubling of the current level of staffing. A number of new and exciting programmes were launched by the Minister of State in 2002 following work carried out by the centre including a &euro;21.1 million research scheme in advanced domestic energy efficiency developments entitled the House of Tomorrow programme and the announcement in August 2001 of details of the second phase of a major &euro;12.7 million work programme to improve energy efficiency in non-commercial public sector buildings. More announcements will follow in 2002. They are designed to ensure that the energy sector continues to play its part in assisting the national effort to meet our targets under the protocol.</P>
    <P>In relation to renewable energy I have set a revised target to support the construction of an additional 500 megawatts of renewable energy based electricity generating capacity to be installed by 2005. The bulk of this target will come from wind energy. As part of the process to ensure the target is delivered by 2005, I launched the fifth competition in the alternative energy requirement series in May 2001. This scheme was intended to support the construction of 255 megawatts of renewable energy based electricity generating plant. However, as the competition was oversubscribed, I decided to make conditional offers of contracts for 363 megawatts. This will ensure that the original target of 255 megawatts is met. The balance of the overall 500 megawatts target will be offered to the market as soon as is practicable in order to ensure the overall target is <Col N="1057" /> achieved by 2005. Work on the NDP initiative to improve the capacity of the electricity grid to accommodate renewable energy plant is progressing.</P>
    <P>The Irish Energy Centre, which is co-funded by my Department, has recently put out to consultation the R D &amp; D strategy for renewable energy. The focus of this proposed programme is to develop a multi-annual programme of funded energy research, development and demonstration in renewable energy technologies. I have secured funding of &euro;16.25 million to support this programme which will be launched later this year.</P>
    <P>In order that rural and regional areas may be in a position to attract and promote further investment in the information communication technology, ICT, sector, the Government has provided &euro;200 million in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to promote and co-fund the roll out of advanced communications networks in rural and underdeveloped areas of the country. Nine contracts involving aid of up to &euro;56 million were signed with five companies in early 2001, following a competitive tender process and these projects will result in a total investment of about &euro;170 million in advanced ICT infrastructure in the regions.</P>
    <P>A second call for proposals was issued in July of this year with the aim of further developing broadband communications infrastructure and services to enable the uptake of the information society in the BMW and south and east regions. Organisations were invited to submit tenders under three programmes: commercial broadband roll out projects, commercial DSL roll out projects to areas prioritised in conjunction with Forfás, IDA and Enterprise Ireland and public projects with economic development and social objectives for which public bodies were eligible to tender. Submissions were received under this second call for proposals by the deadline of 19 October 2002. These submissions were independently evaluated and the results of evaluation were finalised at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>On foot of the evaluation a number of local and regional authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place over the next two months. These proposals involve the construction of metro area fibre optic networks in 19 towns around the country. Networks in other towns are under discussion with the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>A number of private sector tenders received in response to the call for proposals are being clarified and may be offered contracts in the coming weeks. Arising from the Government strategy which I announced on 8 March last a second phase of 48 additional towns will be pursued through a public private partnership model. I am confident the projects which have been selected to date and which will be selected under the new <Col N="1058" /> call for proposals can be completed within the overall timeframe of the plan, achieving its objectives and intended level of expenditure.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann accepts that following many years of under-investment in the rail network, demand exceeds capacity on the Kildare to Dublin route for commuters. The national development plan provides for the upgrading of the Kildare to Dublin suburban line by quadrupling the rail track between Hazelhatch and Sallins to separate long distance and commuter services on the Kildare line and developing Heuston Station for mainline and suburban services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work has already begun at a cost of &euro;117 million to improve the infrastructure at Heuston Station during the next 18 months to allow it to handle trains more efficiently by rearranging the trackwork at the station and increasing the number of platforms from five to nine. When com<Col N="1059" /> plete this will allow an immediate improvement in services. In addition, Iarnród Éireann will, in the coming months, start taking delivery of 80 diesel rail cars which will be used to upgrade services and increase capacity on the Dublin suburban services later in the year. I understand a number of these new rail cars will be used on the Kildare line to provide increased capacity on entering service in 2003. Iarnród Éireann also informs me that planning and design is advanced on the project to provide additional track capacity on the Kildare line.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The Maynooth line was commissioned as a double track line in early 2000. A total of 20 diesel rail cars were delivered to Iarnród Éireann in 2000 for use on the upgraded Maynooth line. These new rail cars and associated track work have increased the capacity of the Maynooth line by over 100% at peak times. Investment on the doubling of the track on the line and the provision of 20 additional diesel rail cars amounted to approximately &euro;55 million. </P>
      <P>The next major project to impact on the capacity of the route is the upgrading of Connolly Station. This project, currently at the design and planning stage, sets out to increase the capacity of the line between Connolly and Pearse stations, thereby allowing extra trains, including trains serving the Maynooth line, operate through the city centre.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed me that during the past two years, a total of 38 new DART carriages have been delivered, of which 26 are now in service with 12 more to go into service in the coming weeks. When the remaining 12 DART carriages are in service the capacity of the DART system will have increased by almost 50% since 2000. In addition, Iarnród Éireann plans to order shortly a further 36 DART cars to facilitate the operation of eight car DART trains at peak hours. These will enter service in 2004.</P>
      <P>In addition, 20 diesel rail cars were delivered to Iarnród Éireann in 2000 for use on the upgraded Maynooth line. These new rail cars and associated track work have increased the capacity of the Maynooth line by over 100%, at peak times. Iarnród Éireann will also start taking delivery later this year of a further 80 new diesel rail cars at a cost of approximately &euro;2 million each. These new rail cars will be used both to replace older rolling stock and to increase capacity on existing suburban rail services.</P>
      <P>I understand Iarnród Éireann is currently evaluating tenders for the purchase of 67 new mainline rail carriages. This evaluation includes an examination of the most appropriate type of rolling stock for future use on mainline services in response to evolving customer needs and demands. I anticipate that this process will be completed very shortly.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1061" />CIE, as part of its ongoing investment programme, has embarked on a communications strategy of advising the public of disruptions to services while works are under way and informing the public of the improvements to the rail network as a result of the investment under the national development plan. My Department has been advised that the cost of Iarnród Éireann's present television advertising campaign, which is funded from its own resources, is &euro;500,000. Furthermore, projects such as the Heuston Station development programme, which are jointly funded by the national development plan and the EU Cohesion Fund have inbuilt into their costs an amount for advising the public of developments in the projects. This is one of the conditions imposed by the European Commission.</P>

      <P>The total Exchequer capital funding provided for in 2002 for investment in public transport is &euro;424 million. Of this amount, &euro;124 million has been allocated to the railway safety investment programme. In addition, EU assistance of &euro;34 million brings the total investment in this programme to &euro;158 million in 2002.</P>
      <P>Further Exchequer investment this year in the development of both the suburban and mainline rail networks amounts to over &euro;140 million. In addition, EU assistance of approximately &euro;70 million has also been secured to co-fund certain rail projects in 2002 including the development and expansion of Heuston Station and the purchase of DART and diesel rail cars. Overall, total Exchequer and EU funding in rail development in 2002 amounts to approximately &euro;368 million.</P>

      <P>The provision under the A7 con<Col N="1062" /> sultancy subhead in my Department's Estimate for 2002 is &euro;5 million. This represents a decrease over the 2001 outturn of &euro;6.73 million.</P>
      <P>However, significant consultancy and related study work also arises in relation to specific programmes and is funded through the relevant subhead.</P>
      <P>A list of the consultancy work, both general and programme related, expected to be undertaken in the coming year is set out in the following table. However, full payment for all consultancies is unlikely to fall due during 2002. As a result no decision has yet been made as to whether consultancies may be postponed or cancelled in light of budgetary constraints. The situation is monitored on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>My Department does not anticipate the postponement of any capital projects as a result of constraints in the consultancy budget. The consultancy requirement for the agencies under my Department's aegis is a matter for the relevant bodies concerned.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-06, a provision of &euro;200 million is available to support the communications and e-commerce measure. A first call for proposals was conducted in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001. These contracts will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. These include delivery of service in the BMW region by Chorus, ESBT, ESAT, Crossan Cable and Nevadatele.</P>
      <P>The Chorus project proposes a BMW broadband communications corridor to provide broadband access to the north midlands and north Connacht. The ESBT project proposes to install a national 48-fibre optic network, encompassing BMW towns. The Esat project will install broadband wireless local loop base stations in five regional towns throughout the BMW. The Crossan project will provide Longford town with a broadband communications infrastructure offering Internet access and other e-commerce and digital services. The Nevadatele project will develop four &ldquo;points of presence&rdquo; in the west, in Carrick-on-Shannon, Sligo, Castlebar, and Galway.</P>
      <P>There were 31 submissions received under the second call for proposals on the 19 October 2002. These submissions were independently evaluated and the results of the evaluation were finalised at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>On foot of the evaluation a number of local and regional authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, and subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for these projects. It is anticipated that this will take place in the next two months. These proposals involve the construction of metro area fibre optic networks in 19 towns around the country, 13 of which are in the BMW region. Networks in other towns are under discussion with the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Government strategy which I announced on March 8 last a second phase of 48 additional towns will be pursued through a public-private partnership model. Phase (i) and Phase (ii) encompass 67 towns throughout the country, 30 of which are in the BMW region. Phase (iii) will involve rolling out the programme to cover all 123 towns in the State with a population of more than 1,500.</P>

      <P>Vacancies for trainees on cruises aboard <i>Asgard II</i> are advertised in the public press. Each year the number of applications exceeds the places available, especially during the summer months. A total of 20 trainees is selected for each cruise and under the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources regulations a minimum of three of the trainees must have appropriate sail training experience. Subject to the foregoing, places are allocated by a selection committee comprising the secretary to an Coiste, the captain and the mate of <i>Asgard II</i> based on the following criteria: gender balance &ndash; about 50% male and female &ndash; age of applicants &ndash; priority is given to applicants in the age group 16-25 &ndash; result of previous applications &ndash; priority is given to applicants who had been unsuccessful in the previous year &ndash; and geographical spread &ndash; an effort is made to select applicants from different parts of the country.</P>

      <P>The original REPS plan received from the person named in April 1995 did not make application for additional payment under supplementary measure 1; neither did the application for second year payment received on 10 July 1996. On 2 July 1997 an amended plan was received with the third year payment application. It identified some of the lands as being within a national heritage area and made application for the additional payment under supplementary measure 1. In November 1997 the person named was paid on supplementary measure 1 with full retrospection for the first two years of her participation in REPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This participant's file was examined in the course of an audit, and a query was raised about the appropriateness of the retrospective payment. The case was reviewed and it was decided that the retrospective payment should not have been made and must be recovered. The participant was <Col N="1068" /> advised of this decision on 9 May 2001 and she was told that my Department proposed to recover the amount in question from her final REPS payment, the application for which was received on 30 June 2000.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 159 of 7 March 2002, the person named included land in his 2001 area aid application to which he was not entitled. He was subsequently issued with maps in order to afford him an opportunity to clarify what land he was entitled to claim for area aid.</P>
      <P>He has since returned the maps to the area aid unit outlining his land. Examination of the maps submitted shows that he was entitled to claim 14.39 hectares as his forage area. He had originally claimed 18.06 hectares for 2001. Therefore, an overclaim of 25.5% has arisen. Since there is more than a 20% difference between the area claimed and the area determined as eligible, EU regulations require that a 100% penalty must be applied and no area linked payments can be made to the applicant for 2001 beyond the 15LU maximum permitted in the absence of an area aid application.</P>

      <P>The question evidently relates to the upper age limit for transferees under the new early retirement scheme introduced in 2000. An upper age limit of 44 years applies in respect of applications received in 2002. It will come down one year at a time until it reaches 40 years in 2006.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the early retirement scheme is primarily to improve the age structure of farming by offering older farmers an incentive to retire early and consequently to enable younger farmers to succeed them earlier than might otherwise have been the case. A farmer can retire under the scheme at the age of 55. An upper age limit of 50 for transferees, only five years less than the minimum retirement age, would detract from the credibility of the scheme as a measure to improve the age structure of farming.</P>

      <P>From October to mid-December 2001 a public consultation process was organised on the CLÁR programme involving meetings with interests &ndash; local authority management and the county development boards &ndash; in the selected areas, followed by public meetings. In this way, the needs of the communities concerned were identified and it was established how they could benefit most from the programme. Priority investments, as identified by the communities, cover infrastructure, social and community services. Several meetings have also taken place to date with county councils' officials on the various strands of the programme.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the public consultation process, a meeting of the interdepartmental committee of all relevant Departments was organised and subsequent bilateral meetings took place with these Departments and some State agencies.</P>
      <P>CLÁR has a fund of &euro;25.4 million for 2002-2003 and this expenditure will reflect the priorities identified in the selected areas. The priorities are being dealt with in three modules and there has been a roll out of funding packages agreed under Module 1: roads, water and sewerage with other funding packages and allocations to be announced very shortly.</P>
      <P>There are ongoing discussions with other Departments and State agencies on programmes under module 2 &ndash; industry, enterprise and tourism &ndash; and module 3 &ndash; health, education and community. However, no decision will be made on categories of projects to be funded under CLÁR without the prior approval of the mainline Department(s). It is hoped to make announcements on the roll out of further programmes in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Any funding allocated under CLÁR is entirely contingent on the relevant county council and county development board actively participating in the agreed programmes. The level of funding to each county with a CLÁR area will reflect the uptake of the various schemes by each county council.</P>
      <P>Under a special non-national roads co-funded package agreed with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Sligo County Council has been allocated a sum of &euro;260,000 for special roads projects of strategic importance in CLÁR areas. A further sum of &euro;40,000 will be allocated to Sligo County Council under a co-funded package agreed with Coillte for access forestry roads of strategic importance in CLÁR areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The procedure for disposing of reactor animals under the TB and brucellosis disease eradication schemes operates on the basis that meat factories tender on a weekly basis for the slaughter of these animals and my Department selects factories on the basis of the prices offered for different types of animals. At all times the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer and therefore the contract for the salvage value is a matter between the farmer and the meat factory involved. My Department's responsibility is to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and to pay the appropriate compensation. If a factory goes out of business, as happened in the case in question, the recovery of any moneys due to losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between themselves and the company's liquidators.</P>

Applicants under the scheme must have suckler cows surplus to the cows needed to produce the milk quota. The milk quota held by the person named at 31 March 2001 is 30,216 gallons so, when divided by the average yield of 876 gallons, 34.49 is the number of cows required to produce this quota. The applicant declared on his suckler cow application that the total number of cows both dairy and suckler owned, possessed, held and maintained on his holding on the date of application was 35. Suckler cow premium is therefore payable on .51 of a cow and .12 of the heifer being 25% of the cows payable.

      <Quest>if there is or was relief or concessions for farmers who were unable to restock their farms within the tax year due to foot and mouth restrictions and were taxed very heavily due to a temporary increase in income which would in part have been utilised to restock; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in accordance with section 657 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, a full-time farmer is entitled to opt to be charged to income tax for any tax year on the average farming profits of a period of three years. This provision, usually referred to as income averaging, is designed to smooth out the effects of any unusual fluctuations in farming profits by spreading the effect over a period of three years. For example, the restriction on the movement in livestock arising from foot and mouth disease may have caused such a fluctuation in some cases, depending on the farmers' accounts at the end of the year and the normal pattern of selling and restocking. In such cases the option of <Col N="1077" /> income averaging is open to the farmers in question, which will ensure that any excess profits are spread over a period of three years.</P>
      <P>I would add that in the Finance Act, 2002, changes were made to the existing special tax treatment under section 668 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for profits arising from the disposal of livestock due to disease eradication measures, including foot and mouth measures. The period over which a farmer may spread the profit arising from such a disposal, which arises on or after 21 February 2001, was extended from two years to four years. Moreover, under the section a farmer is deemed to be entitled to stock relief equal to the profit assessed, provided he or she reinvests, before the end of the four year period, not less than the amount of compensation which was received on the disposal.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the exemption from stamp duty by reference to the young trained farmer scheme as provided for in section 81 of the Stamp Duties Consolidated Act, 1999, as amended, requires compliance with certain conditions, among which are educational qualification in the area of farming. A detailed information leaflet on the relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>An extensive range of educational qualifications in the area of farming is provided for under legislation, but it is essential that the farming qualification, including where required the appropriate 80-180 hours Teagasc certificate, is achieved prior to the date of transfer. The legislation provides that where all the conditions are met prior to the date of transfer, including the 80-180 hours Teagasc certificate where required, except that the transferee has completed only the first year of an approved course, the transferee may apply for a refund of stamp duty where the relevant qualification is achieved within three years of the date of execution of the transfer.</P>
      <P>In this case the deed of transfer was executed on 22 September 2000 and the certificate for 180 hours training in farming was awarded by Teagasc in April 2001. Regrettably in these circumstances, the applicant does not meet the conditions to qualify for the relief. I am further informed by Revenue that it will review the position in relation to the penalties for late stamping when the stamp duty payment has been lodged with its office.</P>

      <P>The internationally comparable measure used to compare expenditure across the EU is general government expenditure, information on which is collected and disseminated by Eurostat. This covers all elements of spending by central and local government, not just the annual expenditure voted by Dáil Éireann. It is difficult to make sound comparisons between spending levels in Ireland and other member states as the figures for measuring levels of output need to be treated with caution. The gap between GDP and GNP is significantly greater in Ireland than in other <Col N="1079" /> member states primarily because of outflows of corporate profits attributable to overseas owners of foreign owned businesses located here. Adjusting for this, and using Irish GNP figures instead, an Irish expenditure figure of about 42.5% of output, GNP, can be compared with an EU average of about 47% of GDP. EU tax levels are correspondingly higher.</P>
      <P>Any assessment of these overall figures should take account of a range of factors, such as Ireland's much younger population which means that expenditure on health and pensions is expected to be lower on demographic grounds, Irish debt-service &ndash; interest &ndash; expenditure is lower than the EU average, Irish expenditure on defence is also lower than the EU average, Ireland currently spends more on public investment than the EU average, unemployment levels and costs here are much lower compared to other member states and in Ireland there is widespread use of private provision for pension purposes which is not the case in some EU countries.</P>
      <P>Eurostat does not collect or disseminate general government expenditure figures broken down by expenditure categories such as health, social security, education and defence. It only publishes material classified on a national accounts basis interest, subsidies, transfers, fixed capital formation and expenditure on goods and services. This information does not facilitate the type of comparison sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Government's introduction of the new regime for taxi licences, section 51 of the Finance Act 2001 provides for a new scheme of capital allowance for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances are effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date. The cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum in line with the new write-off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery. The write-off will be allowed against the trading income only of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if additionally, the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis, then the cost can be written off against both the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" />On Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001, I introduced further refinements to the provision as it stood and these are reflected in section 51 of the Act. The objective was to address certain cases of hardship that had been brought to my attention. Accordingly, section 51 also provides that where a licence was inherited from a deceased spouse who carried on a taxi trade, the licence holder may offset the capital expenditure incurred on the original acquisition of the licence against the rental income from the licence, even if there is no trading income from the licence. This measure will only be available in respect of one licence.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage I further extended the provisions of section 51 to cater for the situation where a widow or widower, who has inherited the licence from his or her spouse, lets the licence to a third party who provides the associated vehicle. In estimating the cost to the Exchequer of this measure at the time it was assumed that each annual tranche representing 20% of the total qualifying expenditure would be capable of being offset against income arising from the taxi trade alone. I have no plans to make any changes to the operation of this capital allowance.</P>

The table also sets out the percentage change in the 2002 estimate provision compared to the 2001 provisional out-turn, which shows both increases and decreases. A change in the level of provision in 2002 as compared with the provisional out-turn for 2001 could arise for a number of reasons, including a change in the level of business requirement from one year to the next and a change in the level of funding available. It is not appropriate, therefore, to refer to the cancellation or postponement of specific projects as a result of a change in provision.</P>

      <P>The framework for risk equalisation is set out in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Midland Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date, more than 50,000 women have been called for screening and over 34,000 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of 70%.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance and best practice and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nationwide.

      <P>Contracting general practitioners are entitled to bonus payments for each calendar year where they achieve a 95% uptake in respect of the cohort of children on their panel who reach their second birthday during that year. This percentage uptake for bonus payments purposes is adjusted to reflect cases where parents have refused immunisation, where families have moved, or where immunisation is contraindicated. Bonus payments in respect of panels where GPs reached the appropriate threshold in 1999 are due by the end of March 2002. GPs enter into a contract with their health boards, and if payment has not been made to them they should, in the first instance, raise the issue of outstanding payment with the appropriate health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department recently met representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation concerning the issue of outstanding bonus payments. My Department has also been in contact with the health boards concerning the issue. While some health boards have indicated that they are experiencing difficulties in relation to bonus payments, they have indicated that they <Col N="1085" /> are currently addressing these difficulties and expect to have them resolved shortly. They also indicate that some of the bonus payments due have in fact been paid. Among the difficulties cited by the boards were systems problems relating to the calculation of payments and the validation of databases. My Department has written to the boards indicating that it is imperative that any outstanding bonus payments are processed and paid as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since mid 1997 more than &euro;171.45 million, £135 million, additional revenue funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of the child welfare and protection services. This has provided for a wide range of developments including alternative care services such as community and family support projects and preventive services. The Government's commitment to tackling the problems of social exclusion in this area was underlined by the launch of the national children's strategy in November 2000 and the passing of the Children Act, 2001.</P>
      <P>In January 1998, the Government established the young people at risk programme, the centre piece of which is the young people's facilities and services fund. An allocation of &euro;9.14 million, £7.2 million, was made from this fund to launch the springboard initiative under which originally fourteen projects were established with a further three developed in 2001 and four more planned for 2002. The objective of these projects is to assist children and young people to remain at home, out of trouble and in school by providing a pro-active, inter-agency response to support these young people and their families. The projects provide for the establishment of formal collaborative structures involving relevant public agencies, the voluntary sector and the local community and the identification or establishment of a local centre which will act as a focal point for the delivery of services to children, young people and their families.</P>
      <P>The recently published national health strategy proposes a number of actions to expand family support services. These include the refocusing of child welfare budgets over the next seven years to further strengthen and develop safeguarding activities and supportive programmes including springboard projects and other family support initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this Government is committed to the development of early intervention and community based services it recognises that in a small number of cases there is need for special residential placement. In this context capital investment of approximately &euro;38.09 million, £30 million, is being made available by this Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or fostercare services. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 93. Included in this figure is the 24 place purpose built special <Col N="1087" /> care unit at Ballydowd in the eastern region which is being opened on a phased basis and the seven place special care unit for girls in Cork. An additional 41 places are due to become available by mid-2002.</P>
    <P>The average annual costs of a high support unit place varies from approximately &euro;130,000 to approximately &euro;200,000 depending on the size of unit, staffing levels and service provided.</P>
    <P>The programme referred to by the Deputy is a commercial enterprise where young people aged 16-26 are trained to become horse stable hands and work riders. Candidates attain certification in racehorse care. Young people from Clondalkin and Ballymun had attended the programme and had been funded by Local Drugs Task Forces.</P>
    <P>The programme had run into financial difficulties due to the withdrawal of funding by the regional office of FÁS. FÁS has indicated there were some problems in the operation of the programme. The FÁS representative from the national drugs strategy team had been in discussion with regional colleagues in the north west about this but the decision of FÁS to withdraw financial support still stands.</P>
    <P>The alcohol and drugs services of the North-Western Health Board had been in contact with the manager of the programme and had offered support and training for staff, none of whom had childcare or addiction qualifications. A needs assessment was due to be carried out at the end of 2001, but the programme has not been in contact with the health board since then. The board is still available to support the centre with training or counselling.</P>

Each health board now has funding for a minimum of three consultant-led child and adolescent multi-disciplinary teams.</P>
      <P>The working group also recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units for children ranging from six to 16 years should be developed throughout the country.

      <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health <Col N="1090" /> Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated.</P>
      <P>In October 1999, The Faculty of Public Health Medicine of The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland issued a report which endorsed the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. In October 2000, the University of York published an independent assessment of the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. The findings were similar to previous reports. Based on the most reliable scientific evidence available, water fluoridation was effective in reducing dental decay and was not associated with adverse health effects. The University of York's assessment did indicate that there has been an increase in dental fluorosis in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas, with the increase being more pronounced in fluoridated areas.</P>
      <P>In 1991, the Oral Health Services Research Centre at University College Cork carried out a survey of adult dental health. This survey found no significant difference in general health status between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. A further study of adult dental health is being undertaken this year and a component of this is an examination of general health. I have requested the researchers to report on the general health status of people living in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I established a forum on fluoridation in May 2000. The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. The forum held its first meeting in September 2000.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the forum are as follows: to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area; to report to the Minister. The forum invited the public to forward their views on the issues under consideration and received in excess of 1,000 submissions, each of which has been examined individually.</P>
      <P>I expect the forum on fluoridation to deal comprehensively with health issues.</P>

      <P>The second schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. Means, for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Paragraph 2 of the second schedule provides that, in calculating the means of an applicant, a health board shall take all sources of income into account, including income from rentals. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles 8.1 and paragraphs 12 to 14 of the second schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, deal with the assessment of the residence of a person in respect of whom subvention has been sought for the purposes of determining the amount of subvention to be paid. The residence of the person seeking a subvention is treated as a special asset and is not <Col N="1095" /> taken into account in certain circumstances, that is, if it is occupied by the spouse of the person seeking a subvention or by a son or daughter less then 21 years of age or in full time education or by a relative in receipt of the old age non-contributory pension or a disability allowance type payment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this rule is to avoid causing undue hardship where the home of a person going into nursing home care is occupied by a dependent relative. If the principal residence is not occupied by a relative falling into the above categories a health board may impute an annual amount of 5% of the estimated market value of the residence as income.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the regulations set out an exclusion whereby a health board may refuse to pay a subvention to a person if his or her principal residence is valued at £75,000 or more and is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind person's pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension, or old age non-contributory pension and the person's income is greater than £5,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining a number of aspects of the nursing home regulations including a review of the value of the principal residence for the purposes of the exclusion clause.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals for the transfer of responsibility for the care and education of children with profound intellectual disability from my Department to the Department of Education and Science. These children have very complex needs and require a multi-disciplinary response involving both health related and educational supports. Responsibility for the provision of health related support services is a matter for the health boards. The Department of Education and Science has responsibility for the provision of educational services.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns which some parents have expressed. There is a need for a high level of co-ordination between both the health and educational services in responding to the very specific needs of these children and my Department and the health services are committed to working with the educational services to ensure that appropriate care and education services are available to children with profound intellectual disability.</P>

      <P>An additional allocation of £4 million, &euro;5.08 million, was made available in the 1998 letters of determination to six of the eight health boards to meet the costs of arrears payments in respect of the full implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and subsequent regulations. These arrears payments arose from an incorrect application within these board areas of article 8.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 which allows health boards disregard a sum equivalent to 0.2 of the old age non-contributory pension when assessing means and calculating the amount of subvention to be paid. Of this allocation, a sum of £750,000, &euro;952,304, was provided to the Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been advised by the Western Health Board that there were 1,242 cases where arrears were due under article 8.2, to the value of &euro;816,996. To date, 1,037 cases, 91%, have <Col N="1097" /> been repaid at a cost of &euro;733,027. Currently, there are 106 cases, 9%, outstanding to the value of &euro;83,969. The Western Health Board has assured me that every effort will be made to complete the making of these payments as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the grades of medical laboratory technician and medical laboratory technologist, which are shortly to be redesignated as medical scientist and senior medical scientist respectively, as recommended in the report of the expert group on medical laboratory technician-technologist grades, recently approved by the Government.</P>
      <P>The number of medical scientist personnel employed in the health service at 31 December 1995 and 31 December 2000 is as detailed in the accompanying table.  Figures in respect of 31 December 2001 are being collected by my Department at present and will be available in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the difficulties currently being experienced in both the recruitment and retention of key health care professionals, including medical scientist staff. An additional 20 training places for medical scientists were put in place from October 1999 to meet the emerging workforce planning needs of the profession. More recently, the expert group examined this issue and recommended that the number of undergraduate places available nationally be increased to 100 to meet future requirements. I understand good progress is being made towards this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group also recommended that the supply-demand balance for qualified medical scientist personnel be kept under review in the light of prevailing circumstances. The requirement for qualified medical scientist staff for the implementation of the health strategy, including the provision of diagnostic facilities to support the planned expansion in bed capacity in the acute hospital sector and plans for the expansion <Col N="1098" /> nationwide of the cervical screening programme, is likely to be relevant in this regard.</P>
    <P>In addition to these developments, a new arrangement has recently been agreed to alleviate shortages of medical scientist personnel where they exist. A one year trainee programme for science graduates who do not meet the requirements for appointment to the grade of medical scientist is being introduced to allow suitably qualified graduates to become eligible for appointment to the grade. The programme is being overseen and validated by the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science. The scheme is intended to facilitate broader access to the medical scientist profession. It is not intended, in general, to substitute current vacancies for trainee posts.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that under section 18 of the Health Act, 1970, the Minister for Health and Children sets the criteria and qualification levels for entry into the medical scientist profession. The Academy of Medical Laboratory Science is the professional body representing the majority of medical laboratory technologists-technicians in Ireland. Under the EU Directive for the Mutual Recognition of Qualifications, the academy functions as the designated authority, with the approval of the Minister for Health and Children, for the validation of overseas qualifications, and the academy also plays a key role in supporting the provision of high-quality pathology services in the health sector by evaluating and advising on the education and training necessary to practise competently as a medical scientist in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any differences or lack of uniformity in relation to the interaction of individual health boards with the academy, bearing in mind that qualification levels are laid down for the profession on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The number of medical laboratory technicians-technologists employed in the health service at 31 December 1995 and 31 December 2000:</P>

      <P>The only proposals submitted to my Department by Kilkenny County Council for the areas concerned relate to water supplies to which I assume the question refers.</P>
      <P>Contract documents for the water supply scheme, submitted to my Department by the council in the mid-1980s and revised in February 2001, have not been approved. Elements of the scheme were included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by the council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of these assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Due to the level of competing demand, the limited funding available, and the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the current programme. However, it will be further considered in the context of the next phase of the programme.</P>

      <P>The Director of Telecommunications Regulation sets the limits on non-ionising radiation emissions from telecommunications installations based on best international practice and is also responsible for monitoring compliance with these standards. The <Col N="1100" /> exempted development provisions of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, which came into force on 11 January 2002 require, for the first time, that all antennae and other apparatus which are exempt from planning permission must now comply with the relevant emission standards specified by the Director for Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
      <P>When the new exempted development provisions were being considered by the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government in December last, there was agreement that internationally derived emission levels for antennae would provide a safe standard from a health point of view, but that sufficient monitoring should take place to ensure that once erected, antennae remained within those emission levels.</P>
      <P>The new regulatory regime reflects this concern. In accordance with my commitment to the committee I am also arranging to put in place a compliance regime, following consultation with all relevant interests, to ensure that all telecommunications antennae adhere to the strict limits for non-ionising radiation emissions. My Department has accordingly been working with the Department of Public Enterprise researching best practice abroad to ensure that the new compliance regime, to be operated by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, will be as thorough as the best systems in place in other countries. I expect that proposals will be finalised in the very near future.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that my Department will spend approximately &euro;7.3 million on consultancies in 2002. The amount spent on consultancies in 2001 was &euro;5.18 million and accordingly there is no cutback in consultancy expenditure. While the detailed spending programme for 2002 has not been finalised, areas for which major expenditure on consultancy progress is envisaged include housing, environmental awareness, water services, spatial planning and waste management. Details of the budget for consultancies and related study contracts in organisations and agencies under the Department's aegis are not held in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. Some &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme grant aid is available towards the purchase and-or installation cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist. Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder-burglar alarms of the type indicated in the Deputy's question. To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people, aged 65 or over, must be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the equipment covered by the scheme themselves. While the actual grant available may <Col N="1105" /> vary in the light of individual circumstances, grants in general will cover 50% of total costs but grants up to 90% may be made where the circumstances so warrant.</P>
    <P>Individuals who wish to obtain information on how they, or older people known to them, can obtain assistance under this scheme should contact their local representative of any of the organisations involved in the scheme, such as, Muintir na Tíre, Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, or any other group involved in the scheme in their local area.</P>
    <P>The 2002 scheme of grants will be advertised extensively in the national and provincial newspapers in the near future. While a closing date for receipt of applications is applied each year, the regional offices of my Department are flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community. A review of the scheme was completed in April 1999 and there are no plans to amend the scheme.</P>

      <P>The special pre-1953 pension was introduced from May 2000. The pension is paid at 50% of the maximum rate, with payments for dependants also made at 50% of the appropriate rates where applicable. The payment was modelled, both in terms of qualifying conditions and rates of payment, on the special self-employed pension which was introduced from April 1999.</P>
      <P>In general, a qualified adult allowance is paid at a lower rate than the personal rate. However, in reduced rate pensions the treatment of these allowances was somewhat uneven. In pro rata pension cases and the special pre-1953 and special self employed pensions the qualified adult allowance reflected the rate at which the personal rate was paid. In some standard reduced rate cases the qualified adult allowance exceeded the rate being received by the pensioner.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, the Government made a commitment to increase the qualified adult allowance rate for those over 66 years of age to the maximum of the old age non-contributory pension over a number of years. In the context of this commitment it was also decided to standardise the treatment of qualified adult allowance payments on reduced rate pensions. From April 2001 the qualified adult allowance payments in all new cases reflect the rate at which pensions are awarded. For instance, if a person is awarded a pension at half the full personal rate the qualified adult will also be paid at half the full qualified adult allowance rate. Special arrangements were put in place for those cases where the qualified adult allowance payments already exceeded the personal rate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 175 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>A person aged under 55 who receives a redundancy payment of more than &euro;19,046.07 from his employer is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for up to nine weeks. The actual duration of the disqualification is a matter for the deciding officer in each case, but the guidelines recommend that the length of the disqualification be linked to the size of the redundancy payment in each case.</P>
      <P>People over the age of 55 are not affected by this restriction. There is considerable evidence that older people who become unemployed are less likely to become re-employed than younger workers. The study Employability and its Relevance for the Management of the Live Register, published by the ESRI last year, showed that the gap between younger and older workers in this regard actually increased between 1992 and 2000.</P>
      <P>Given that older workers face this level of disadvantage in the labour market, it is considered that their more favourable treatment in relation to redundancy payments is justified.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 22 January 2002. He was paid supplementary welfare allowance pending determination of his claim.

The person concerned was not in receipt of disability allowance previously and in the new facility care and maintenance is being fully provided by the health board.

      <P>The main element of my Department's consultancy budget comprises provision for assistance with projects to develop and improve the delivery of the Department's services including projects in the IT area. Provision is also made for consultancy assistance in other areas, including policy development. Expenditure on consultancy fluctuates from year to year depending on the number and timing of the major change projects which are being undertaken at any time. In 2001 expenditure on consultancy amounted to just under &euro;5 million. This was less than projected due to the fact that expenditure on one major project to develop and modernise service delivery was substantially lower than estimated. The Department's 2002 Estimate for consultancy expenditure is &euro;11.564 million. Work is proceeding on a number of the projects involved, including the new service delivery model project referred to above. A detailed outline of projects to be undertaken in 2002 will be forwarded separately to the Deputy. My Department has not cancelled or postponed any consultancy or capital projects.</P>

    <P>As far as the agencies under the Department's remit are concerned the amount of funding approved for consultancy within the 2002 budget for Comhairle is &euro;220,000.

No specific amount has been approved in respect of consultancy and related contracts within the overall budget of the Combat Poverty Agency.

As stated in my previous reply, the Deputy will, of course, appreciate that the granting of planning permission in any particular case is a matter for the relevant planning authority, and not for my Department.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the implementation of the habitats and birds directives in Ireland is causing losses of the kind referred to by the Deputy; neither do I accept his criticism of the role of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. The Deputy will be aware that the habitats and birds directives have the status of community law adopted by the Council of the European Union on the basis of proposals from the Commission. Directives are addressed to member states and are binding in law as to the result. All Ministers, state agencies and local authorities have responsibilities in this respect.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for decision making in respect of development proposals in port and other coastal areas is with the planning authorities and my colleague the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources. As a statutory consultee Dúchas has only an advisory role under planning legislation and the Foreshore Licensing Acts.</P>

      <P>The main instrument for transposing the habitats and birds directives into domestic legislation is the habitats regulations.

      <P>I have outlined the number of special area of conservation draft management plans, and the stages that these plans have reached as recently as 7 March 2002 in reply to Question No. 456 of 7 March 2002. Most of the draft plans for SACs and SPAs are ready to go to public consultation &ndash; 296 draft plans out of 341. In a small number of cases, 24, the public consultation process is already under way. However, before they go to the wider public I consider it imperative that land owners in SACs should be consulted and have their comments taken on board as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of my firm view that the best way of facilitating this land owner consultation is by way of the local liaison committee. It has to be said that difficulty in setting up these committees in some areas has been a contributory factor to the slow progress that has been made to date with this work and I would welcome the Deputy's support for the establishment of local liaison committees in his area. I do not think it would be appropriate to use electoral deadlines for the purpose of making progress with this very important work. I feel that private landowners' rights should be fully respected and should not be compromised, and that ample time should be afforded for a full consultation process to take place.</P>

      <P>The EU Habitats Directive requires EU member states to designate special areas of conservation for a wide range of habitats and species, in accordance with scientific criteria specified in the directive. Early estimates of the amount of land to be designated were necessarily based on limited information available at the time, and did not fully take account of marine and freshwater areas. The figure of 14.1% referred to by the Deputy comprises approximately 9% land, including small freshwater areas, 1% large lakes and 4% marine areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any undertaking that was or could have been given to the IFA regarding an upper threshold or limit on the amount of land that would be designated. However, I am of course aware of the undertaking given to the <Col N="1113" /> farming community in the Partnership 2000 agreement with regard to compensation for losses arising from SAC, and SPA, designation. While this is not specifically alluded to in the successor to that agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the same compensation arrangements remain in place and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>Subhead A7 of my Department's Vote is the main source of funding for consultancies undertaken by my Department, although the costs of some consultancies are met from divisional subheads. In the context of the Revised Estimates Volume for 2002, the allocation of &euro;2,385,000 in 2002 to Subhead A7 represents an increase of 202% over the provisional outturn for 2001, which was &euro;791,000. The main reason for the increase relates to expenditure on the Department information framework and IT projects. Clearly, as there has been no cutback, there has been no need to cancel or postpone any planned capital projects or consultancies as a consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major consultancies planned for 2002 in my Department, and the three main national cultural institutions, National Museum, National Library and National Archives that are part of <Col N="1114" /> my Department, are set out in the following table.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 88 on the 23 May 2001. Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, incorporates the principle of non-refoulement which means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>

    <P>In view of the history of political instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I can assure the Deputy that matters there are kept under constant review prior to any decision being made on deporting any person, including political activists.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of child pornography on the Internet poses significant legislative and law enforcement challenges world-wide. International co-operation is a key to progress in this area and such co-operation is ongoing in the areas of law enforcement, policy development and international agreements. My recent signing of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is an example of the latest initiative in such international co-operation which will help in addressing child pornography issues.</P>
      <P>While the nature of the Internet demands a co-operative approach, I have always sought to streamline our national laws and structures so as to maximise our contribution to the fight against child pornography. Following the publication by my Department in 1998 of the report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet, a number of initiatives to combat child pornography were established. A national public hotline for reporting child pornography was set up in November 1999 and is funded by the Irish Internet service provider industry and EU Internet safety programmes. In February 2000, I established an Internet advisory board to oversee the implementation of the 1998 report and to ensure that the self-regulation regime recommended in that report would be implemented in practice. The board has been active in the area of education and research and the general monitoring of the activities of all the parties involved in addressing the issue of child pornography on the Internet. A recently-agreed new code of practice and ethics for Irish Internet service providers is the latest objective to be achieved from the combined efforts of the board and the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the national legislation in place to deal with child pornography, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, contains a wide variety of measures which apply to child pornography on the Internet. For example, it is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years for anyone to knowingly produce, distribute, <Col N="1116" /> print, publish, import, export, sell, or show child pornography. Mere possession of child pornography can attract a penalty of five years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the reporting of child pornography, as already outlined, a special hotline is available for this purpose. Reporting can, of course, also be made directly to the gardaí. The investigation of child pornography, whether on the Internet or elsewhere, is part of the function of the domestic violence-sexual assault investigation unit in the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation based at Harcourt Square, Dublin 2.</P>

      <P>Legislative provision already exists to allow for an appeal against a sentence on the basis that it is unduly lenient. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, provides that in the case of all indictable offences, which would include rape and sexual assault, the Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal a sentence where it appears to him or her to be unduly lenient. The decision to appeal a sentence in any particular case is, of course, a matter solely for the Director of Public Prosecutions who, by law, is independent in carrying out his or her functions.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is an application for First Registration which was initially lodged on 7 February 2002, and rejected on 18 February 2002. Dealing number D2002JS001735A refers. An amended application was re-lodged on 21 February 2002 and legal queries issued on 13 March 2002, and on 25 March 2002. I am further informed that there has been no delay in dealing with this case. However, until legal queries raised have been fully and satisfactorily responded to, this application cannot proceed. I can however assure the Deputy that on receipt of a satisfactory reply to these queries, the application will receive further attention in the Land Registry.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas that the current personnel strength of the Clare division as at 26 March 2002, is 234 &ndash; all ranks. This compares to a figure of 215 on 1 January 1997, and represents an increase of 9% in the personnel allocated to Clare division since that date. An additional probationer garda is also due to be allocated to the division on 5 April 2002. I am also advised that Garda resources assigned to the Clare division, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strat<Col N="1118" /> egy, is continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
      <P>I am further advised by the Garda authorities that Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Clare division with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. When additional personnel next become available the needs of the Clare division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

I can further inform the Deputy that while many of the subheads within the Vote include an allocation for consultancy in relation to particular areas of work for 2002, two subheads relate specifically to consultancy and research. Funding for these two subheads has been reduced by approximately 20% on the 2001 <Col N="1119" /> funding. No specific projects involving consultancy or research under these subheads have been cancelled or postponed as a consequence of the reduced provision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the licensed trade are concerned that the rights of licence holders to refuse admission and service in the interests of operating licensed premises in a peaceful and orderly manner are being eroded. Arising from what they see as a diminution of the discretion previously available to them, they have called for a more general amendment of the Equal Status Act with a view to ensuring that they retain control of their premises. I accept that the interface between existing responsibilities on licensees under the licensing code and more recent obligations imposed by equality legislation is in need of clarification. While the licensed trade maintains that the provisions of section 15 of the Equal Status Act, 2000 &ndash; which were intended to ensure that actions taken by licensees in compliance with the licensing code could not be regarded as discriminatory &ndash; are not operating as intended, I note that neither the Circuit Court nor the High Court have ruled, on a point of law, on any appeals against equality officer decisions to date. I understand that five such decisions have been appealed to the Circuit Court but the grounds for appeal are not known to my Department at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of case law, it would be inappropriate and untimely to propose amendments to existing legislative provisions. In the meantime, I consider it appropriate to request the Commission on Liquor Licensing &ndash; which is already <Col N="1123" /> engaged in a review of the liquor licensing code &ndash; to consider the issues arising in this context and to make recommendations, if necessary, for legislative changes. The Government has agreed with my proposal to extend the terms of reference of the Commission on Liquor Licensing as follows: &ldquo;to examine the rights of licence holders to refuse admission and service in licensed premises and to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have asked the commission to seek submissions from the general public, including particular groups that have taken positions, in the past, on the subject of equality, equal status etc., in addressing this new term of reference.</P>

As regards the specific case referenced by the Deputy, the dealing in question was lodged on 19 November 2001. It thus attracted the new fee as set out in the 1999 Order. No previous fee had been paid on the dealing. I will arrange to have a summary of the 1999 increases forwarded to the Deputy under separate cover.</P>

      <P>My Department was not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993 my Department issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools. Their purpose was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" />The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department, and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, where staff within my Department receive telephone calls regarding instances of bullying, advice and assistance are offered by staff to the callers. My Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. The National Educational Psychological Service is also available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties. To progress this case further, I have asked my officials to contact the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee Report on School Transport have been considered in my Department. A number of improvements were put in place in 2001. These included reducing the qualifying distance for eligibility for school transport for primary school pupils aged ten and over from three to two miles, so that all primary pupils are treated equally for eligibility purposes. The number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new school bus service has been reduced from ten to seven. All school transport vehicles now have a communication system on board. The scope of the remote area grants, payable to pupils in certain circumstances, has been extended and the rate of grant payable has been increased.</P>
      <P>The travelling and waiting time for post-primary pupils has been reduced from three to two and a half hours. Where feasible students who are on the early pick-up from their homes are the first to be dropped home in the evening and vice versa. The safety aspects of school transport have been examined by the school transport section of my Department together with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A report has just been completed and copies are available from my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Submissions are invited from all interested parties. When the submissions are received and examined, consideration will be given to the question of what improvements can be put in place to further improve the safety of the children who use the service.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. An application for an extension to Lisronagh national school is currently being examined. When this examination is complete my Department's building unit will be in contact with the school authorities.</P>

      <P>The new programme, Giving Children an Even Break, which I launched last year to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level, replaced the previous process of the designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC.</P>
      <P>The Educational Research Centre's records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in the new programme was not received at that time from the school in question. In the absence of a completed survey form from the school, the ERC was unable to assess the level of concentration of pupils in the school with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage. Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the approach outlined, representations from the school in question were forwarded to the centre. My Department has now received a report from the centre and the situation of such schools, including the school in question, seeking inclusion in Giving Children an Even Break is currently under consideration. The school authorities will be informed of the outcome of this process in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners. The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001, was 129 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal and four mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year. As the agreed retention figure for the fifth mainstream <Col N="1132" /> class teacher is 146 pupils, I regret that it is not possible to sanction a continuation of this post at the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2002-03 school year. The school referred to by the Deputy is being extended and refurbished as part of the Government's expanded building programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the circumstances of the schools referred to by the Deputies. These schools are already benefiting under a number of schemes aimed at addressing educational disadvantage. However, there is no scheme providing child care workers in schools generally and, accordingly, it is not possible to give any commitment in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies are aware of the major new disadvantage programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched in January 2001, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Giving Children An Even Break is being run over a three year period and will cost some &euro;33 million with the allocation of over 200 teaching posts. The schools targeted under Giving Children An Even Break were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary <Col N="1135" /> schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf.</P>
    <P>Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the schools in question, retain their entitlements under that scheme, and also receive extra funding. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the schools in question are each benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher. The schools also qualify for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to Giving Children An Even Break. The schools in question have been included in the urban dimension and are eligible to receive supplementary capitation funding in respect of the current school year, towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. Scoil Íosagáin has been allocated &euro;1,658 and Marist national school will receive &euro;4,039. This funding is in addition to grants of &euro;3,885 to Scoil Íosagáin and &euro;10,323 to Marist national scheme under the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>Schools categorised as urban in Giving Children An Even Break with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils, including the schools in question, are being supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class, and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.</P>
    <P>The schools referred to by the Deputies have been included in the support teacher project since 1999 and share the services of a support teacher who works with pupils with disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviour. One of the schools in question is also in the Early Start scheme and has been allocated additional resources to cater for the pre school children attending.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that the position of these schools will fall for consideration again in the context of the development of measures to address educational disadvantage generally.</P>

      <P>The Institute of Technology, Carlow established outreach centres at St. Peter's College, Wexford and Seville Lodge, Kilkenny in 1995. The institute has been operating these outreach centres on the basis of sanction obtained annually from my Department. In the current academic year there has been no intake to courses at Seville Lodge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking to make provision for off-campus education, institutes of technology have adopted various approaches. The following are examples. Athlone Institute of Technology has established links with Cavan College of Further Education and with Greendale Community School, Kilbarrack, Dublin, which involve students attending the first year of a national certificate course in Greendale or Cavan and transferring to the second year of the course in Athlone Institute of Technology. Waterford Institute of Technology works in partnership with local educational organisations including vocational education committees, Teagasc, FÁS, health boards, Irish Farmers Association, diocesan youth services, county enterprise boards and the National Literacy Agency in response to meeting identified local needs. GMIT, Waterford Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown and Cork Institute of Technology have established linkages with agricultural colleges at Mountbellew, Kildalton, Warrenstown and Clonakilty involving co-operation in the delivery of certain courses. GMIT is also involved in a joint initiative with Connemara West in relation to the operation of the furniture college in Letterfrack which focuses on education programmes in applied furniture design, restoration and manufacturing skills. Other institutes, including Institute of Technology Tallaght, Cork Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology and Limerick Institute of Technology, have adopted a strategy involving the teaching of national certificate and diploma programmes in <Col N="1139" /> engineering, electronics and computing on an in-company basis.</P>
    <P>In August 2000, I announced my plans to strengthen the education base in regions which are not well served at present and to establish effective links with higher and further education institutions. Following on this announcement, the Ferns diocesan authorities offered St. Peter's College as a location to facilitate the development of an outreach centre with higher and further education links. In accordance with my plans the proposed centre will have a local management body and a dedicated budget. A head of centre has been appointed locally to develop and implement a strategic plan for the provision of an educational programme to meet the needs of the people of Wexford and the surrounding area. While it is envisaged that the proposed new centre will establish links with a range of course providers, it is necessary to have an established third level institution which will act as lead institution for legal, accounting and academic purposes. The Institute of Technology, Carlow has agreed to act as the lead institution in respect of the proposed Reachout Centre in Wexford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs of children with attention deficit disorder, ADD, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools with the support of the special resource teacher service. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>Many children suffering from attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and-or special needs assistant services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1998, the Government decided that all children with special needs, including children suffering from the conditions to which the Deputy refers, should henceforth be entitled to <Col N="1140" /> an automatic response to their needs irrespective of their level of need or location. As a result of this development, since early 1999, the number of resource teachers supporting such children has been increased from 104 to more than 1,600 full-time equivalents. The number of special needs assistants has been increased from less than 300 to approximately 3,000, including both full-time and part-time posts, over the same period. Additional such resources are being deployed on an ongoing basis as further needs are identified.</P>
    <P>Where the level of the disorder is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 8:1 and special needs assistant support is provided where required.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to continue to build on these developments so as to ensure that all children, including children with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, receive the support they require.</P>

      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 170 of 21 March 2002, the locations of the additional 75 places for the training and education of speech and language therapists will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next 15 years. In relation to speech and language therapy training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places over the previous level of 25 training places.</P>
      <P>I have recently sanctioned an increase of 75 in the number of places for the education and training of such speech and language professionals so that those most in need will have access to the therapists who will help them get the education they deserve.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority to pursue the issues arising from the report. The Higher Education Authority invited institutions to submit proposals for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes for the three disciplines. The proposals received are currently being considered.</P>

      <P>The school attended by the person does not yet have access to the psychological service provided by the national educational psychological service agency, NEPS. The school principal may therefore avail, on behalf of the student, of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. I announced funding for this initiative last June. It allows schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. Full details of the scheme have been issued to all schools and are also available from my Department's website.</P>
      <P>I have also asked the NEPS regional director for the region in which the school is situated to contact the school after Easter to investigate the child's needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251, 252 and 253 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the pressures on school managements in order to ensure that schools remain open after the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties, took effect on 4 March 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contingency arrangements were drawn up by the representative management groups, the Joint Managerial Body, JMB, the Irish Vocational <Col N="1146" /> Education Association, IVEA, and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, following detailed discussions with officials of my Department. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools so that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. In addition, my Department undertook to recoup the cost to the management authorities in advertising for, recruiting and training personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis.</P>
    <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, based on a minimum of two hours supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required, this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28 per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers.</P>
    <P>For purposes of the contingency arrangements, payments have been made to schools by my Department, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270 per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum. In addition, funding has also been provided to cover employers' PRSI and holiday pay. Under the contingency arrangements a payment amounting to 5% of supervision costs is been provided to schools to pay for additional support, including secretarial assistance. In aggregate, the sum disbursed to schools amounts to some &euro;9 million, which equates to nine weeks calculated in accordance with the above formula. The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant.</P>
    <P>The Joint Managerial Body, JMB, placed advertisements on behalf of the managerial authorities in the national media over the weekend of the 16-17 February and also operated a telephone help-line for schools. My Department has recouped &euro;114,258 to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date.</P>
    <P>In addition, training was organised by the JMB for personnel engaged by the schools by way of a day long seminar organised in a number of different venues nationwide. Schools were also advised to arrange for a period of local induction to familiarise new employees with their specific duties and the school.</P>
    <P>The contingency plan, by its nature, is flexible and does not specify a pupil-supervisor ratio, as it is recognised that the number of persons required would vary from school to school depending on the layout, both internal and external.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the contingency plan, schools were advised that all supervisors should be recruited in accordance with appropriate employment equality legislation. As many of the personnel to be employed may not have a background in teaching or dealing with young people, schools were advised to either seek references and clear the background of the new employees. Schools were also advised that it was necessary <Col N="1147" /> for schools as part of the recruitment and appointment process to secure and check character references and to make such inquiries, as the school considers necessary, to satisfy itself as to the character of each appointee. In addition, schools are obliged to obtain from the Garda a satisfactory clearance report in respect of each appointee. Supervisors employed do not have the right to expel pupils.</P>
    <P>The current position is that the INTO has accepted my Department's proposals for payment on the basis of &euro;34.28 per hour. The TUI and ASTI have rejected them.</P>
    <P>The ASTI issued a directive to its members to withdraw from supervision and substitution with effect from 4 March 2002. The directive applies to supervision at break times and before and after school and to substitution by permanent teachers for absent colleagues.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 15 February, the ASTI made a new set of demands in relation to supervision and substitution. These were a minimum annual rate of &euro;2,500; that it be pensionable; available to existing pensioners in compensation for having done this for free over a number of years; and that it be within the 22 hours weekly maximum teaching time.</P>
    <P>I met the three teacher unions on 28 February 2002. I indicated that the Government is not opposed to the pensionability of supervision payments. In that regard, I offered to enter into a process at the end of the current school year to work out the details of an arrangement that would be consistent with the requirements for pensionability. I also indicated that the procedures provided by the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers should be used to deal with the issue of an appropriate payment rate for supervision. These procedures include independent arbitration where the parties cannot agree.</P>
    <P>My approach was welcomed by the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Teachers' Union of Ireland but rejected by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland. The ASTI central executive has since decided not to enter into any further negotiations on this matter pending the settlement of its pay claim.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Teachers Conciliation Council on 12 March, the TUI and INTO requested that further discussions take place on the issue of supervision and substitution. These discussions commenced today with the aid of a facilitator. The ASTI has taken the view that it is not prepared to deal with this issue within the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme, which is the agreed industrial relations forum for processing these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of Community Employment, CE, schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of some &euro;58,407,951 per annum to my Department on a phased basis between 2001 and 2003 as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department received a total of &euro;40.6 million for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from &euro;50.79 per pupil per annum to &euro;126.98 per pupil over this school year and the next. With effect from September 2001, the grant was increased from &euro;50.79 to &euro;76.18 per pupil. This has been further increased to &euro;101.58 per pupil with effect from January 2002. As a result the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less has increased from &euro;3,047.37 to &euro;6,094.74 per annum. At second level, I introduced in September 2000 the school services support fund under which schools now receive additional annual funding. With effect from November 2001, the annual grant was increased from &euro;25.40 per pupil to &euro;63.49 per pupil. This will further increase to &euro;88.88 per pupil next September and to &euro;99.04 per pupil in January 2003. These increases are in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes. Smaller schools will benefit from an increase in the minimum services support grant to &euro;19,808 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of voluntary secondary schools, the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that I announced recently will bring the minimum support services grant in the case of such schools to &euro;32,264 from September next and to &euro;34,296 <Col N="1151" /> from 1 January next. Finally, I am aware that the phasing out of CE schemes may result in some schools experiencing certain difficulties. In this regard, I have set aside approximately &euro;2.5 million in 2002 to respond to the particular difficulties that may be experienced by some schools. I have not yet finalised proposals as to how this money will be allocated. The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school-based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>The report of the action group on access to third-level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants. The group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The child dependants of people on designated programmes were also included in the target group.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in cases where a grant holder is assessed on the income of parents or guardians FÁS training programmes or CE schemes undertaken by the parent or guardian are designated programmes for purpose of establishing eligibility on the part of the grant holder for the special rate of maintenance grant. The parent or guardian must demonstrate that he/she had an entitlement to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs' child dependent allowance, or an equivalent payment, in respect of the grant holder prior to progressing on to the programme.</P>

      <P>The school bus service available to the family in question was examined by my Department in November 2001. It was considered that a re-routing was not warranted as the family had a level of service within Department guidelines. There is provision for families having a level of service within guidelines to pay for re-routing, where this is feasible. Payment is made direct to Bus Éireann for this service. The family availed of this option. It is not open to me to sanction a reduction of payment in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level maintenance grants schemes, grants are tenable in respect of approved full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years' duration or full-time postgraduate courses of at least one year's duration in an approved institution. There <Col N="1153" /> are no plans at present to extend the terms of the maintenance grant schemes to include part-time courses.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition costs of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges. The question of introducing free fees for part-time students, similar to those given to full-time students, could only be considered having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. Tax relief is available in respect of tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time courses. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

      <P>At present, the courses run in the State that allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the Bachelor of Education degree and the full-time 18-month graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the Colleges of Education, which specialise in the training of primary teachers. The graduate diploma course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers and has been provided by the Colleges of Education for the past number of years. The most recent course commenced in February of this year. Discussions will be held in the near future with the Colleges of Education in relation to providing another course in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the current supply <Col N="1154" /> difficulties. As part of a range of initiatives to improve teacher supply, the intake to the B.Ed. programme in the Colleges of Education has been increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999 more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. The total intake to the Colleges of Education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,750 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the Colleges of Education. The number of places made available on the graduate diploma courses since 1997 is 1,453.</P>
    <P>Between 2001 and 2002 it is projected that some 2,300 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the Colleges of Education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the H.Dip. in Education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. Since September 2000, teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the H.Dip. are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU-trained teachers previously had to acquire the necessary competence in the Irish language within three years of their first appointment to a primary school. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have provided that these teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori-trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, are also recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers. These Montessori-trained teachers are also granted restricted recognition to teach in a temporary or permanent capacity in certain special schools and special classes. The decision to grant fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State restricted recognition to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. All aspects of primary teacher <Col N="1155" /> training are the subject of ongoing review between my Department and the Colleges of Education. My Department is also examining further options for addressing the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests.</P>

Similar increases under the programme have already been paid with effect from 1 October <Col N="1157" /> 2000 and 1 October 2001. I am not aware that these payments have resulted in any significant disruption to the work of schools.</P>
      <P>The numbers of teachers who retire in any one year represent about 2.5% of the numbers employed. About 20% of annual retirements are compulsory by reason of age and these take effect on the last day of the school year, 31 August. A further 20% occur under the provisions of the early retirement scheme for teachers and unless there are exceptional circumstances, these also take effect on 31 August. About 12% of retirements arise because of ill health and these can take effect at any time during the school year. In the case of the balance of retirements, less than 50%, it is open to the teacher to choose his or her date of retirement. These voluntary retirements can take effect at any time during the school year with particular peaks at Christmas, Easter, mid-term and end-of-year.</P>
      <P>Teachers who retire voluntarily are expected to give adequate notice of their intentions to school management. Three months notice is normally expected by school management, excluding the summer holiday period.</P>

      <P>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, provides for an appeal to the Secretary General of my Department where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses to enrol a student; suspends a student for a cumulative total of more than twenty days in an academic year; or expels a student from the school. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent or student concerned. However, a longer period for making appeals may be allowed as an exception where it is accepted that circumstances did not permit the making of an appeal within the 42-day limit. Section 29(4) provides that appeals must be concluded within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the appeal by the Secretary General, with the possibility of extending this period by 14 days. The date of receipt for this purpose shall be deemed to be the date on which the completed appeals application form containing all the required information has been received by my Department.</P>
      <P>There are three layers to the procedures. Having regard to the desirability of resolving grievances within the school where possible, the parties to an appeal, i.e. the appellant and the board of management, will be asked to consider the matter in the first instance at local level to see if an accommodation can be reached. Notwithstanding the failure to reach agreement at local level, it may be considered possible to facilitate agreement between the appellant and school. If so, a facilitator will be appointed to attempt to broker an agreement between the parties. If facilitation fails the appeals will be forwarded to an appeals committee comprising of three people, that is, a departmental inspector and two other people who have the requisite expertise, experience and independence to serve on the committee.</P>
      <P>The appeals committee will notify its determination to the Secretary General of my Department. The Secretary General will notify the parties of the determination of the appeal, and, if applicable, issue such directions as he or she considers necessary to the school. The board of management will be bound by such direction. The procedures outlined above have been in operation during the course of the current school year.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals at present for the transfer of responsibility for care and education of children and young people with severe to profound intellectual disability from the Department of Health and Children to my Department. Children with a severe or profound general learning disability require a multi-disciplinary response involving educational and health inputs. Responsibility for providing health care rests with the relevant health authority. My Department has responsibility for educational support services.</P>
      <P>In terms of the educational component, children with severe or profound disabilities are entitled to provision in special dedicated schools or in special dedicated classes attached to schools. Currently there are five dedicated special schools for pupils with severe or profound disabilities. There are also 125 special classes allocated to address the educational needs of pupils with severe or profound general learning disability. Further such classes are being established in response to identified needs. The nature and severity of the condition in question requires a high level of co-ordination between service providers on the education and health sides. I would regard it as absolutely essential that such co-ordination should continue to be a central feature of service delivery in this area.</P>
