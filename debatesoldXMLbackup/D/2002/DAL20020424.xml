      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputy Ó Caoláin. I call on the Deputy to state the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1, Ombudsman for Children Bill, 2002 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 51, <Col N="1022" /> statements re the report on the motor insurance industry. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 1, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Health and Children; the proceedings on No. 51, shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; the statements of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes; and Question Time tomorrow shall be taken at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter. Private Members' business shall be No. 74, Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill, 2002 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed) to conclude at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government promised zero tolerance on crime, yet street crime is out of control. Violent crime on the streets has increased by 131%. Five years ago, the Taoiseach promised to eliminate waiting lists in hospitals, yet these are in excess of 26,000 and have increased by 24% in Dublin. He promised to control inflation which has rocketed since. It is the highest in Europe at twice the European average. He promised to provide affordable child care places. Fewer places are available than five years ago and the vast majority of young couples cannot afford them. The Taoiseach promised to control and reduce high house prices. They have doubled and, for the first time since the foundation of the State, the purchase of a house is beyond the reach of ordinary young couples. That is the Taoiseach's record. Can he explain how, after all the prosperity, his Administration has failed so dismally to deliver on the issues of most importance to the majority of people in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it reasonable to infer that, despite repeated promises, a number of commission reports and assurances from the former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the dramatic failure of this Administration to introduce legislation to regulate the private rented sector is an indication of the strength of the housing and building developers' lobby and the hold it has over Fianna Fáil, as seen from various revelations in the tribunals? Will the Taoiseach indicate why this measure has not seen the light of day in spite of his numerous promises in recent years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan, five years ago I said that the administration I would lead would create jobs, cut taxes, unemployment and crime and bring peace. We created almost 400,000 jobs and cut unemployment from 10.3% to 4.3%. Long-term unemployment has been reduced from 5.5% to 1.2%. The scourge of emigration that has been with this country for decades has been ended and we have had economic growth in excess of 10%. We increased the health service budget by more than 100% and the education budget by more than 70%. The dignity of work has been given to an enormous number of people in this country. We broke the record <Col N="1024" /> of 1.75 million people employed here and trebled child benefit. We brought down corporation tax and most small businesses that are thriving from the Celtic tiger economy we created are still developing strongly.</P>

This is what the Taoiseach is directly responsible for creating. The quality of life for most people has gone down and that is the direct responsibility of this Administration. Worst of all, at the end of the Taoiseach's time in office he is leaving the Exchequer in deficit when he got it in surplus. The next administration, as always after Fianna Fáil, will sweep up after its ineptitude.</P>

      <P>The private sector has done <Col N="1025" /> many good things and the policies we implement have helped it to achieve. In our last budget we introduced a social welfare package of more than &euro;1 billion, the largest in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>Under the PPF we are investing a record &euro;1.9 billion on social inclusion over the lifetime of the programme. All this has nothing to do with the private sector. Contributory old age pensions have increased by more than 50%. There is a 28.5% increase in average industrial earnings since 1997 and it is up to 31% today. We still remember that the rainbow Government increased old age pensions by £3 in its last budget. Consistent poverty has more than halved from 15% to 6.2%. Child poverty has fallen dramatically. Child benefit has more than trebled.</P>

      <P>There is a decided end of term atmosphere about this House. The gallery is full of young school children who are likewise looking forward to an end of term. I note that the House has agreed today on the Order of Business to complete all Stages of the Ombudsman for Children Bill. I have repeatedly asked the Taoiseach about schools since last January, and I ask him again, when will all those children who sit in classrooms that are rat-infested, whose parents worry about the conditions in which they are taught, whose teachers anguish at the dilapidated state of the buildings in which they are being asked to provide first-class education, have the information that has been repeatedly sought on their behalf by elected representatives in this assembly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" />On 17 May, or thereabouts, people will be asked to cast their votes for public representatives to come into this House. One of the rights of public representatives is to hold Ministers to account. We have had a hapless Minster for Education and Science who has refused, against every republican and democratic principle and tradition in this House, to put on the record information that he promised to my colleague, Deputy Shortall, on four separate occasions. Representative democracy either means something or it does not. Before the House goes into recess, will the Taoiseach honour the democratic and republican principles of this Assembly and respect the elected representatives, many of them his own backbenchers, who get ridiculous inane responses from the Minister for Education and Science as to when taxpayers money &ndash; not Fianna Fáil money &ndash; will be made available for the 850 schools that cannot establish where they are on the list? When will they get the information to which they are entitled? Otherwise, we are asking people to engage in some class of a farce if this information is being withheld. The Minister has had enough time to brief the Taoiseach in response to this question. As elected representatives of this House it is our right to access this information and it should be published before the Dáil goes into recess and not be allowed to become a kind of gravy train in the middle of May.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is obviously not going to make this information available before this House goes into recess, totally undermining the democratic rights that will be given to us in the ballot box by citizens who come out to vote. An election candidate who is not a Member of this House, one of three Fianna Fáil candidates in a five seat constituency, has informed the principal of a particular school that he or she is to have no dealings with any other candidate, not even with that candidate's running mates, who happen to be Members of this House.</P>

As the importance of the title is that it should be instantly understood and accessible by all children, the English name will appear in the English version and the Irish name in the Irish version.  The ombudsman will provide material which is accessible and easily understood by all children, but I do not see any reason to include the Irish version of the ombudsman's title in the English version, particularly since the most difficult word to understand, the word &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo;, remains the same in both. It will appear in Irish in the Irish version of the legislation and in English in the English version.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 44, after &ldquo;promote&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and protect&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This issue was discussed at length during the Seanad debate. The Minister of State has missed the point in regard to this matter. There is a desire and demand from many organisations working in this area that the dual role of the ombudsman should be stated in the legislation which is to promote and protect rights. The Minister inferred yesterday that this sought to give a role to the ombudsman to protect children. I am not suggesting that because the health boards have that statutory role. However, there is a need to spell out the role that should exist for the ombudsman which is to protect the rights of children. Obviously where he or she sees those rights being denied there would be a role in ensuring those rights are protected. As well as promoting rights, there is a need to protect rights. This is a very important point in regard to the whole role proposed for the ombudsman. I ask the Minister of State to support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;and protect&rdquo;. The Minister said on a number of occasions that she cannot accept the amendment. It seems the classic work of an ombudsman is to protect as well as promote and it is strange it is not included. While I totally agree the health boards have a role in protecting, I cannot understand why an ombudsman could not also have that role. It would not in any way undermine the work of the health boards, whose role is to protect, if there is also an ombudsman with the remit to protect children. This would broaden the role in a meaningful way and add to the work of the ombudsman. It would not mean the work would become unduly demanding because the essence of the work of an ombudsman should be to protect children. It is strange this is not included in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has not advanced very good arguments for her stance. The ombudsman could look at services and advise the Government on policy in regard to children. It seems protecting children is a basic part of what the remit should be. I ask the Minister to reconsider the amendment which would strengthen the work of the ombudsman, complement the work of the health boards and add an important dimension to the work of the ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that the Deputies would want to offer the greatest protection possible to children, as we all do. However, the legislation already provides for a dual role for the ombudsman, making it different from ombudsmen throughout the world who may just have an investigative role in regard to complaints, <Col N="1033" /> whereas this ombudsman will have a promotional role. In promoting the rights of children, there is obviously a built-in protection in that he or she would highlight issues of concern, maladministration and failures, advise Ministers, have an input into legislation and so on and be very public about all this. That will create a greater awareness of the rights of young people and children simply by promoting them and thereby forcing other people to act to protect those rights.</P>
      <P>I do not believe a statutory duty should be given to another body to protect the rights of children. Deputies Shortall and Fitzgerald said the health boards have a statutory responsibility, therefore, we do not want a situation where any one group could say someone else has that responsibility. We do not want a situation where we would need to fund a separate structure to protect the rights of children whose welfare might need to be protected by another body on behalf of the health boards. One would end up either duplicating the work of one body or ensuring that neither group would carry out the work, which is not what is envisaged.</P>
      <P>The scope of the powers of the Ombudsman for Children are extensive in that in promoting the rights, they will be protecting. However, to build in a statutory responsibility to protect the rights of children would be unduly onerous, unnecessary and may perhaps duplicate the work of others. We should be reminded that the ombudsman is an added voice, not to take over the role of other groups but to add to their work. Because the dual role exists the person will have enough to do and will be able to do it well without having the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>This country signed up without reservation to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It has taken an inordinate length of time for that convention to work its way into the thinking of many organisations and State agencies in terms of their approach to children's issues. The difficulty is that no one promoted the convention. While the Children's Rights Alliance played a role in this regard, no one had a statutory responsibility. This will now fall to the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
      <P>The other role of protecting those rights is even more important and goes to the very heart of what the Ombudsman for Children should do. It ensures the services are in place to protect children. The Minister of State is suggesting that we are saying the ombudsman should have a role in protecting children under the child welfare protection services. We are not saying that because the health boards have that responsibility. We also know that despite the health boards having the statutory responsibility they are not providing this service. Governments have not provided adequate funding and they have not made a sufficient effort to ensure staff are available, therefore children are not adequately protected. I gave a number of examples of that yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a mechanism whereby the <Col N="1034" /> ombudsman's office will be able to put pressure on the health boards and other State agencies to ensure they do their job in regard to protecting children, thereby protecting the rights of children as enunciated in the convention. I feel very strongly about this point. To omit the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; in regard to the role proposed for the ombudsman will seriously dilute the role we all hope the ombudsman will have. Therefore, I will be pressing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shortall's point is very relevant. Why would we say in the national children's strategy and the work the Minister has been doing that we are committed to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provides for the protection of children's rights, yet not make explicit reference to that phrase when setting up the position of ombudsman? We are saying in the national children's strategy that we are committed to implementing and fully observing the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, articles 3 and 19 of which provide for the protection of children's rights. Why, therefore, is there not explicit reference to that and why not give the ombudsman this as part of his or her task?</P>
      <P>The other point relates to the point made by the Children's Rights Alliance. The Supreme Court decision of 17 December 2001 placed clear limitations on the court's power to intervene to protect the rights and welfare of children. Judge Murray, in expressing the majority view of the Supreme Court, alluded to the exceptional circumstances that must be present before the court can order the executive to fulfil a legal obligation. I will not read the full document which outlines very specific circumstances. The Children's Rights Alliance now asks, in light of the Supreme Court decision which impacts on the Minister for Education's decision in 1995, to whom should the function of the protection of the rights of children fall if not to the Ombudsman for Children. The Children's Rights Alliance which works with senior legal advisers and people like Peter McVerry and others who care about the rights of children are strongly of the view that this Bill should contain the words &ldquo;promote and protect&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the enormous shortcomings in the system, I wonder if the Government fears the inclusion of those words would unduly strengthen the ombudsman's powers. The Minister of State makes the case that the phrase would take away powers from the health boards. Another perspective would be to say it provides a requirement for the health boards and the ombudsman to protect children. Instead of seeing it as a weakening of the work of the health boards, one would see it as an increase in protection and care for children. It allows for a more objective analysis of what is happening because the ombudsman who is independent and has the resources can step in and say children are not being protected and stating what needs to be done. That would provide an objective analysis of what was wrong and put pressure <Col N="1035" /> on and encourage Governments to do more in this area. Not to include it would be a weakness in the Bill and incongruent with the Government's national children's strategy.</P>
    <P>If the Government's national children's strategy is linked to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, why would it depart from it in this way when establishing the office of an ombudsman?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is the responsibility of many organisations and groups, statutory and voluntary. If we have signed up, as a nation, to the protection of children's rights, then it is our duty to ensure we do protect them. However, it is important to note that this ombudsman has a dual function to promote and investigate. If the ombudsman discovers the health boards are not doing their duty he or she, having highlighted and investigated the problems and come up with findings of maladministration, can ensure action is taken on foot of that investigation. That will protect the rights of the child regarding those bodies which have statutory responsibility to look after him or her.</P>
      <P>If, as Deputy Shortall said, there are shortcomings in the health board, it is then the duty of those of us who are members of health boards to ensure those duties are fulfilled and thus protect the rights of the child. We are all responsible for protecting the rights of the child. We would simply be setting up another parallel structure if we placed this statutory obligation on the ombudsman. What happens if the Ombudsman for Children determines that his or her duty is to protect the right of the child regarding basic needs? Do we then have to provide a system and structure for the ombudsman to provide that service? That is not what is intended. What is intended is that those with responsibility will provide the service. The ombudsman will highlight these issues, promote the rights of children and will have the right to investigate failures or maladministration but he or she will leave those with statutory responsibility in this area to get on with providing the service.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State gave an example relating to the health boards but she is well aware that the health boards have no control over the number of people who go into training for social work which is one of the most neglected areas of child welfare and protection. There is no way health boards, even when they have sufficient funding, can get access to necessary staff because agreement on the type of course provided and the numbers taken into the colleges is way beyond their remit. It is primarily a matter for the Minister for Health and Children who has overall responsibility for child welfare; the Minister for Education and Science who has responsibility for training places and the Higher Education Authority which is supposed to advise the <Col N="1036" /> Minister of the day on the number of places required.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Education and Science discussed this matter in great detail over the past year. We invited representatives in from the Higher Education Authority who told us about their role in advising the Minister. When we inquired about this further, on foot of an FOI request, we discovered the Higher Education Authority had not advised the Minister about the lack of adequate places for the training of social workers. If there is a shortage of social workers &ndash; we have been hearing about this for the past ten years &ndash; then somebody must take action and ensure training places in our colleges are increased so that enough people are in training to meet the needs of our legislation and services. If somebody had taken responsibility for this some years ago we would now have sufficient social workers to provide the required services.</P>
      <P>There is no co-ordination between the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the health boards. The identification of such problems is precisely the kind of role we should be creating for this ombudsman. He or she would be able to do so by virtue of his or her responsibility to protect the rights of the child. Everyone involved in child welfare wants to ensure this ombudsman has real teeth and does not simply undertake promotional work and the investigation of individual complaints, although that is important work. We want the ombudsman to play the very central role of identifying the overall problems affecting children's rights. Such problems, as the Minister of State is aware, cross several different Departments and agencies. The ombudsman must have the power to step in on the basis of the need to protect the rights of children and make recommendations to Government. Nobody is doing that.</P>
      <P>Due to the way in which Government is structured, responsibility for children falls between several different stools. At the end of the day, the buck does not stop with anybody. The protection of children is a key aspect of the role of the Ombudsman for Children. We must ensure that person has real teeth and is going to make a difference in this area. It is critical that the ombudsman is given the statutory role of protecting the rights of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments against including this phrase are paper thin. I do not know what legal advice the Minister of State received on this but her arguments here today are not convincing, nor were they in the Seanad. The Minister of State is, on the one hand, saying part of the ombudsman's promotion function will be to protect, yet she will not include the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo; in the Bill. She is saying it is understood the ombudsman will provide protection but we are not writing that into the Bill. It almost seems that the Minister is afraid of creating a supervisory <Col N="1037" /> role by the ombudsman in relation to services for children.</P>
      <P>At least seven different Departments deal with various aspects of children's lives. What we have as a result is a very piecemeal approach. The Minister of State's Department bears a particular responsibility in this area while another holds the money in regard to child care and another bears responsibility for children in particular settings. There is a real need for more co-ordination. The ombudsman could play a key role in protecting children's rights by looking at this area, making recommendations and observing where the gaps lie. If the ombudsman is not given the job of protecting children's rights then it would seem there is the potential that a whole area of work will not be developed as well as it could.</P>
      <P>Despite the attempts by the Minister of State, which I acknowledge, the deficiencies in the service are appalling for a modern economy. The child care service is in crisis. The Minister of State is making individual efforts and I do not wish to take from them. If one examines what is happening in child care, one will find it is in chaos and crisis. Exceptional cases may be dealt with but case after case of serious child sex abuse is not investigated. The agencies have told me they have to word their letters in a certain way in the hope that the health boards will take up the most serious cases. There is an appalling lack of service to the most vulnerable children. Goodness knows it is difficult enough to get services for children who are attending primary school and who need a psychological assessment or children who have special needs. There is nobody to help children from dysfunctional families. The health boards are doing the work but they are in crisis. Surely, the ombudsman would have a role to examine this area and give an overview, make recommendations, force policy development and force awareness of what needs to happen. To exclude protection would weaken the essential core of an ombudsman. It does not matter how the work of the ombudsman is defined in other countries, what matters is what is done here. It will be a shame if the Minister of State does not accept this recommendation and take the opportunity to strengthen the role of the Ombudsman for Children.</P>

      <P>A number of issues have been raised in relation to co-ordination between Departments and the role of the ombudsman. Section 7 covers the promotional role and the protection of rights. On the issue of what the ombudsman can do in relation to advising Ministers etc., the section specifically states that the ombudsman shall advise the Minister or any other Minister on the development and co-ordination of policy, encourage bodies to promote the rights and welfare of children, monitor and review generally the operation of legislation concerning matters that relate to the rights and welfare of children and establish structures etc. Where the ombudsman identifies a need, a want, <Col N="1038" /> a lack, a failure, or a direction in which Ministers or public bodies should be going, he or she can advise them that this is the way they should go to protect children and their rights.</P>
      <P>We all acknowledge that the lack of social workers is causing serious problems in a number of different areas. This is the reason there has already been an increase in the number of social workers being trained with an extra 85 places being phased in.</P>

Had there been more people in the system already who were in a position to take some of these social workers for training purposes, it might have been possible to double the number. If the ombudsman finds the health boards are failing in their duty, the role of the health boards, not the ombudsman, should be strengthened to ensure they have the staff, resources and facilities to enable them to respond to their statutory duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of children crosses a number of different Departments. In preparing the national children's strategy we looked carefully at the whole idea of a Cabinet Minister for children. How does one take the child out of the family? One cannot separate the child from health or remove the child from education  as they belong in each of those sectors. That was the reason we decided on the structure of the national children's office which has been established and is working well. It is led by an assistant secretary with staff from the key Departments with responsibility for children: the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Education and Science. Top level staff are co-ordinating the work of those different Departments. Following careful consideration, that was the structure which was devised. Given that extra staff are coming on stream, matters that need full co-ordination will be dealt with. For example, the implementation of the Children Act is being driven by the office with top level senior civil servants <Col N="1039" /> working across the different Departments. The ombudsman would be able to highlight issues in relation to co-ordination and advise the Minister and any other Minister as set out in the Bill. He will be able to protect the rights of children <Col N="1040" /> through his promotional and investigative role. However, it would not be a positive move to give him a statutory responsibility to protect the rights of children when that is the duty of others.</P>

The protection element is built into the investigation and promotion, particularly in this context, but does not give the ombudsman another specific power to move in to protect the office.

      <P>In page 14, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&ndash;Notwithstanding the terms of <i>section 11(1)(a)</i>, the Ombudsman may apply to intervene in any court proceedings involving the welfare of a child as an <i>amicus curiae</i>, and may furthermore initiate such proceedings as it considers necessary for the exercise of his or her functions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was debated at length in the Seanad where the Minister said there was no need to make provision for the ombudsman to be allowed to apply to intervene in any court proceedings involving the welfare of children as an <i>amicus curiae</i>. The Minister said that because of the current system regarding the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> in proceedings there was no need to extend the power of the ombudsman in this regard. The guardian <i>ad litem</i> system applies in relation to public law proceedings. There is as yet no provision in private law proceedings for a guardian <i>ad litem</i>. Obviously, in such proceedings there is no clear mechanism whereby the voice of the child can be heard. That is the reason for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system, the reason the Minister of State is saying she cannot accept the amendment, this is an area in need of attention. It should certainly be examined. The situation is that the courts have been given broad discretion to appoint someone to do certain things in children's cases, but the net result of such discretion is a chaotic system of representation for children with significant variations as to the operation of the guardian <i>ad litem</i><Col N="1043" /> provision throughout the State. We have a serious situation where we do not have regulations which ensure a strong role for a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, a provision which has worked effectively in England for years in terms of protecting the rights of children in court. We have set up the system, but not gone to the trouble of ensuring it is comprehensive in order that children's voices are heard in court. It is hard enough for adults' voices to be heard in court, but will be much more difficult for children. That is the idea behind the guardian <i>ad litem </i>system.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is using a weak argument regarding the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system for not accepting the amendment. This role has to be strengthened. We are proposing that the ombudsman would be able to apply to courts and intervene in cases involving the welfare of children as a friend of the child and that he or she may even be able to initiate such proceedings if he or she believes it necessary for the exercise of his or her functions.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to strengthen the role of the ombudsman in the key area of the courts in which problems are presenting and where the welfare and protection of children are such key issues. A system in which the guardian <i>ad litem</i> and the ombudsman play complementary roles would be a powerful force for children in the courts. Given that the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system is not as developed as it should be, that serious issues involving children are coming before the courts and that children have had poor independent representation in the courts, this is a perfect opportunity to give children a stronger voice through the intervention of the ombudsman. Such occasions would be rare and the ombudsman would have to decide how this system would work. However, this would be a strong provision and could be a powerful force for the protection and welfare of children in court.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what the Deputies said regarding the voice of children in court. Children are the most vulnerable in society and their voices have to be heard. There is a commitment in the national children's strategy to overhaul the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system. That is the way to proceed. I accept that the system has to be revitalised and changed to ensure children's voices are heard. However, in the context of this legislation, where a system is failing or not working as well as it could be regarding giving all children a voice in court, the response should be to change it, rather than placing all the responsibility on a different body. To avoid giving the ombudsman a role which was never intended and duplicating the role of the guardian <i>ad litem,</i> it is my intention, through the National Children's Office, to completely overhaul the system. The views and voices of children can be best looked after in this way, rather than by what is proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 28 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as inserted by section 11 of the Children Act, 1997, extends the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> to private law proceedings, but there is a serious absence of detail. This is one of just two sections of the Children Act, 1997, which are not yet in force. The difficulties regarding the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system have persisted for over a decade. In that context, it seems reasonable to propose that the Ombudsman for Children should have powers of referral to domestic or international courts where important points of principle arise.</P>
      <P>Cases often arise concerning child policy which could have important effects on child legislation. In that context, it would be useful and necessary to have an independent voice for children and their welfare who would make a submission. This would give the ombudsman an input into important cases involving the development of child policy.</P>

The office of the ombudsman would still have the same requirement to uphold, protect and promote the rights of all children, irrespective of their nationality or status. The amendments make a clear distinction in this regard. The <Col N="1045" /> Minister of State is suggesting that we are trying to create a role for the ombudsman in the asylum process, but that is not the case. We are proposing that the ombudsman should have a role in issues involving the welfare and protection of all children.</P>
    <P>The examples cited in this regard are the appalling direct provision conditions in which many asylum seeking children live. In some of these inappropriate settings, such as hostels, six or seven members of a family are housed in one bedroom with inadequate sanitation and cooking facilities. Such cramped and inappropriate conditions in which many asylum seeking families are forced to live have led to tragic accidents. There are issues regarding the rights of such children who need to be protected. It is not appropriate to exclude the Ombudsman for Children from investigating any of these complaints. I, therefore, urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 deals with problems or issues which arise prior to the commencement of the legislation. I see no basis for excluding such complaints. It is as if the Minister of State is suggesting that only events which take place from now on can be investigated. Where ongoing difficulties exist regarding child welfare and protection services, they should be included, even if they refer to events which took place last year or in five years' time. There is no logical basis for excluding them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to amendment No. 13. Under the Bill as worded, any Minister could veto an inquiry being undertaken by the ombudsman if such a request is made in writing. This provision removes the power of the ombudsman who should be independent. It should not be possible for a Minister to step in and ask the ombudsman to cease an inquiry or investigation. That paragraph, subsection (1)(e)(iii) should be removed.</P>
    <P>I will make a point in relation to children in prisons or places of detention. We know there have been serious difficulties with the operation of St. Patrick's institution where 16 and 17 year old children are incarcerated in what is, essentially, an adult prison. Since the Child Care Act came into effect all persons under the age of 18 are regarded as children. At times 16 and 17 year olds may seem grown up but mentality, attitude, needs and legally they are children. There is no basis or justification for excluding such children or suggesting that such a prison would not be subject to inspection or investigation by the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The issue is further complicated by the recent announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that because of the inadequacies and virtual collapse of the juvenile justice system under the Minister for Education and Science he intends to create an additional 20 secure places, possibly in St. Patrick's institution. Because the Minister has a political problem, as a result of public outrage in relation to juvenile <Col N="1046" /> offenders, he has plucked this proposal from the sky. This is, in essence, a poorly thought out response to a political problem.</P>
    <P>Of course the Children Act, which we have yet to see commenced, precludes the placement of children in such facilities. However, because that Act has not commenced, we now have a situation where the Minister makes a proposal which goes against the nature and thinking of the Act. He proposes that for the time being, in order to deal with his political problems, we arrange to place children in such totally inappropriate circumstances. This means that children, possibly as young as 13 or 14, who the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may at his political whim decide to incarcerate in a prison, and also those children who have been placed in prisons because there have not been adequate or appropriate places provided to cater for disturbed, troubled children or destructive children, will not now have the protection of an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Minister, yesterday, assured us that she would bring forward an amendment to deal with that. It is wrong for the Minister to deceive us in this way. She gave a clear indication that she would remove this section but what she has done now is to introduce an amendment saying that this offending subsection shall cease to have effect on and after such date as may be specified in an order made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If particular political circumstances allow, the Minister may at some future date cease this section. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an undertaking yesterday that she would amend the Bill to remove the intent of this section. She has not done that and it is not acceptable. On a regular basis she talks about upholding the rights of children. The rights of children, particularly when they are incarcerated in inappropriate settings such as St. Patrick's, need the protection of the State. The Ombudsman for Children could be in a position to provide that protection and would be the best person to do so. The Minister is denying these most damaged young people in our society any protection by her failure to keep her promise to amend this Bill. It is a poor day for disadvantaged and troubled children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question for the Minister in relation to refugee, asylum seeking or immigrant children. If those children are in &ldquo;direct provision&rdquo; do they have access to the ombudsman? The reference here says, if the action is one &ldquo;taken in the administration of the law relating to asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship,&rdquo;. We could argue that &ldquo;direct provision&rdquo; comes under administration of the law because it is a decision that has been taken by the Government. It has been taken as the way that children should be looked after &ndash; in families who are seeking asylum. Under this Bill will children in &ldquo;direct provision&rdquo; have access to the ombudsman if there are issues in &ldquo;direct <Col N="1047" /> provision&rdquo; which adversely affect their health and well-being? This is a key issue and I would like the Minister to reply with a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the question because the Children's Rights Alliance believes the provision excludes many children of refugees and asylum seekers from the provisions of the Ombudsman for Children Bill, 2002.</P>
      <P>There is increasing concern in Europe over the number of unaccompanied children, children being trafficked, and children being moved from one country to another without their parents. States are working out good practice in this area and trying to make the best possible provision for these children. There are probably several dozen such children who have come here who are not getting any services. The statement of good practice in Europe for these separated children would certainly say that they should have access to the ombudsman in the country where they end up. They are vulnerable and it is debatable that they will ever reach the stage where they will begin to get the kind of protection they need because they live marginalised and excluded lives.</P>
      <P>We should not add to that by excluding them from the provisions of this Bill which might give them some protection. The code of practice would say that separated children are entitled to the same treatment and rights as national or resident children. They must be treated as children first and foremost and all consideration of their immigration status must be secondary. The Minister has said on a number of occasions that they would have access, but would those children in &ldquo;direct provision&rdquo; have access?</P>
      <P>We also need to examine the area of children in detention. It is important that children who are in prison places, for example a child in a cell, can have access to redress. Section 56 of the Children Act, 2001 provides that a detained child can be kept in a cell where no other place is available. The situation does arise. Again, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides for the protection of the rights of children and young people in the criminal justice system. Article 37 of that convention refers to the dignity of the child charged with an offence and guarantees detention as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.</P>
      <P>How do we deal with child offenders and what kind of protection do we give them? It is clear that the Ombudsman for Children should be allowed to conduct investigations into prisons or other places used for the custody and detention of children. In New Zealand where there is a specific limitation on the children's commissioner's authority which prohibits him from investigating any act or omission of any court or decision, no such restriction applies to investigating the position regarding children in police cells. Those children would still have access to an ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the Minister of State today deals with another issue. It is interesting <Col N="1048" /> to hear her describe what she intends to do. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently announced extra places, but if the Children Bill, 1997, had been enacted and its provisions brought into force he would not have been able to make that announcement because the Bill would have prohibited him from putting children in such a place. We all know that secure places are needed. This is not an argument about whether those young people should be in secure places. Of course they should and they should have received the kind of assessment and care they needed long ago. However, this panic reaction, the proposal to put into such places young people who have not even been found guilty of anything, would be illegal if the Children Bill that was passed by the House had been brought into force.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is introducing a proposal to include such places under the remit of this Bill while saying that it will not be done until such time as the Minister decides. I am not altogether clear on this so I will wait and hear what the Minister of State has to say about this provision before I make further comments on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of different issues have been raised. First, the children of asylum seekers and refugees will have access to the Ombudsman for Children in the same way as every other child in Ireland. The only thing that is excluded is the administration of the law, in other words, the procedures for defining and determining whether a person is entitled to a particular status. The administration of the service is a different thing. My understanding is that all the children referred to here will be entitled to access to the ombudsman. A particular case is made for unaccompanied minors. They come into the care of the health board when they arrive but they are also automatically covered. It is almost misleading to list that group under &ldquo;exclusions&rdquo;&ndash; the children themselves are included but the exclusion refers to the administration of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shortall raised the question of actions prior to the Act. The advice from the Attorney General is that we cannot retrospectively make bodies subject to legislation. If something is still going on it is obviously an issue of concern and can be investigated but this is a standard provision in all legislation of this type. The ministerial veto was also mentioned and I must admit I was curious about this when I first saw it, which is why we returned to the Office of the main Ombudsman to see how it works and why it is there. The reason for allowing a Minister to prevent the ombudsman investigating a complaint is to exclude points of judgment for which a Minister is answerable to the Dáil. It is to maintain the responsibility of a Minister to the Houses. The fact that it must be in writing and will be included in the annual report ensures that the ombudsman is also protected. The provision was put into the 1980 Act on the recommendation of an all-party working group in 1979. When we <Col N="1049" /> returned to the Ombudsman to inquire about its validity we were informed strongly that even though the provision has not been used&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State referring to the Office of the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am referring to the Office of the Ombudsman because the provision is currently in the legislation relating to that office. We inquired about the validity of continuing with the provision and we were informed that it offered protection to both sides, to the Minister, who is accountable to the Dáil, and to the office itself due to the written report and so on. Even though it has not been used by a Minister the office strongly recommended that it be maintained as part of the legislation, which is why it is there.</P>
      <P>The question of children in detention centres was also raised. There is no doubt that in the legislation as published there is a serious anomaly in excluding a group of children such as this, perhaps the most vulnerable group of children, especially as children in educational detention centres were included while the older groups were not. The provision of new places by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was alluded to by the Deputies. Those places will be designated by the Minister for Education and Science under the 1908 Act so they will automatically be covered immediately by the Ombudsman for Children &ndash; they will be included under the designation of children's detention centres. That would have left only the likes of the young people in St. Patrick's Institution so I was anxious to discuss this with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The reason we have put down the amendment as it stands is that it is our intention, using the funding and resources which have been made available, to establish the Office of the Ombudsman for Children immediately, despite the amendment I accepted in the Seanad at the beginning for a two-year commencement order. There will not be a two year wait. The money is available and has been allocated so it will be done immediately. The ombudsman is a final port of call for investigation when all other avenues have been exhausted. A number of other avenues exist for various areas &ndash; for example, in the education process there are boards of management, the Department and so on. The avenue for prisons and places of detention at present is the visiting committees, where complaints can be investigated, which have been up and running for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new inspector of prisons, Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen, is being appointed and I believe he is taking up his position today. This will lead to an inspectorate of prisons, which will inspect and report on prisons, detention centres and other places under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Because that is only now being set up, the Minister and the Department are anxious that it should have some <Col N="1050" /> time to establish itself so that its roles will become clear with its relationships with the visiting committees and the ombudsman. If this Bill were not to come into effect for two years there might be no difficulty in automatically removing the exclusion but because the two will be happening in tandem it is felt very strongly that time must be given to the new inspectorate of prisons to become established and to be that extra port of call.</P>
    <P>The amendment is a positive one which states &ldquo;shall cease to have effect&rdquo;. I know it states that this will happen when the order is made, but at the end of every year the ombudsman will make a report and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas to highlight issues. The fact that the order has not been made or needs to be made will constantly come before the House. We are awaiting the establishment this week of the inspectorate of prisons. We will give it some time to become established and following that the exclusion of young people in detention centres will cease to have effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I return to the final point made by the Minister of State. All people under the age of 18 are children and should come within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children. Setting up an inspectorate of adult prisons, however badly needed, is not the appropriate inspection mechanism for places of detention for offenders of 16 and 17. This issue came up when we were debating the Children Bill, 1997, and I asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain his rationale for having a dividing line at the age of 16 whereby any offender under 16 was the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science and any over 16 was the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister replied that it was a historic provision and that was the way the system worked.</P>
      <P>However, given recent thinking on the needs of children, responsibility for all offenders under 18 &ndash; all persons who are legally regarded as children &ndash; should be the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science. It does not make sense that 16 and 17 year olds are at the mercy of a Department which deals primarily with adults. Rather than leaving the circumstances of 16 and 17 year old offenders to inspection by the prisons inspectorate, it should be covered by the ombudsman. In talking about young offenders, what is the justification for a 15 and a half year old having access to the ombudsman and a 16 year old not having that access? It does not make sense. A much more satisfactory way of dealing with the inspection of prisons would have been to provide in this Bill for inspection of adult prisons only, while offering the protection of the Ombudsman for Children to those under 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a mistaken tendency to regard 16 and 17 year olds as almost adults. This misguided thinking has meant that 16 and 17 year old offenders have been treated in the same way <Col N="1051" /> as adult criminals. Many young offenders have been failed badly, particularly by the education system which should respond to the needs. That young people quickly become out of control and get involved in serious crime is due in part to the State's failure to put in place educational services to cater for them. The State is often quite happy to leave young offenders in the hands of the adult prison authorities, which is particularly unacceptable given the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I call on the Government to remove responsibility for children aged 16 and 17 from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>I get the impression that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has had a strong say in the creation of this Bill. It seems reluctant to allow an independent office to examine the regime it operates for children. Those aged 16 and 17 are children and should therefore be the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science and particularly the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin. That these issues have not been addressed properly in this Bill represents a retrograde step in the area of children's rights. This opportunity to make the changes I have mentioned has been missed, an error which has been compounded by the announcement last week, of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of additional places. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, knows in her heart that the Government is taking the wrong approach in relation to young offenders. It is a serious mistake to facilitate the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's approach to issues affecting those under the age of 18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how the fact that the new position of Inspector General of Prisons and Places of Detention is being filled today is relevant to the protection needed by those under 18 in places of detention. The Minister of State is using the argument as a cover for the fact that young offenders aged 16 and 17 are to be treated as adults, but it is an irrelevant and inaccurate point to make as it is not linked to the matter under debate. Essentially, it has been decided to give protection under this Bill to certain young people, but others will not be protected if they are in certain centres of detention. This mistake has been exacerbated by the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last week to create an extra 25 places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin is aware of the contradictions with which we are dealing. She must be embarrassed as she knows that if the provisions of the Children Act, 2001, had been brought into effect, 16 and 17 year olds could not be placed where this Bill proposes to place them. She knows that this Bill will not allow those aged 16 and 17 to benefit from the protection of the Ombudsman for Children. She is varying the <Col N="1052" /> order in an attempt to retain discretion in these matters, but she knows this is not the best way in which to operate. The ombudsman will be interested in a number of problems faced by young people when they move from one residential care centre to another. Many people working in such centres are worried about the problems that will arise when young people transfer from a prison to a place of rehabilitation in preparation for a return to the wider community. Those who work with young offenders have expressed concern about what will happen to them in the interim period and wonder how they will be helped in the long term, after their departure from detention centres.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a quick fix political solution, introduced by the Government in a panic. It is obvious that it is far from ideal. As Deputy Shortall said, young people in prisons need somebody to evaluate and comment on their circumstances and the Ombudsman for Children should be in a position to do so. We should not exclude the provisions of my amendment, as the Minister of State suggests, on the ground that this matter will arise every year. Will it arise in the ombudsman's report? Who will ensure that this is dealt with more appropriately?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I made clear, the 25 new places will automatically be covered as they will be designated by the Minister for Education and Science. It is not intended that the new places should be seen as a long-term solution, as they are to be put in place pending the completion of the Department's &euro;32 million capital building programme, which will increase to 181 the number of places available for those under 16. When the programme has been completed, it is intended that the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide extra places will no longer exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is untrue to say that the facilities to which I refer are prison places <i>per se</i>, as the Special Residential Services Board, which has been established to co-ordinate the use of places, is working actively between the Departments to ensure that they are facilities for children. It is widely recognised that the standard of education provision in St. Patrick's Institution is superb. It is worth noting that the Social Services Inspectorate, established by this Government to investigate other residential centres, has highlighted that the education service in such centres is of a high quality. Such education services make a key difference to young people in such institutions, who will automatically be covered by the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distinction between those under 16 and those aged 17 and 18 relates to the fact that the age up to which a child is compelled to attend school has been raised to 16, as well as the historical background to such matters. Responsibility <Col N="1053" /> for children under 16 has to rest with the Department of Education and Science, but the system of tracking young persons to ensure they benefit from education and training continues until the age of 18.</P>
    <P>The power of the Ombudsman for Children to investigate does not preclude him or her from promoting and highlighting issues relating to children in detention. The ombudsman will not be stopped from talking about the wider conditions of detention, but he or she will not be allowed to pursue individual investigations based on complaints. When the inspectorate of prisons has been established, which I envisage will happen quite soon, the ombudsman will be the next voice. The inspectorate will cover all detention services, including detention units under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, although Deputy Shortall may not agree that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall spoke of the anomaly of including certain people and not including others. We will create a welcome anomaly by agreeing to the provision contained in my amendment. A 17 year old in St. Patrick's Institution will be covered by the remit of the Ombudsman for Children, but the 18 year old with whom he is sharing a room will not be covered. There are anomalies in many services and I agree that we are creating another one, but I was anxious to remove the clear anomaly that children in detention centres run by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform were being excluded altogether. Real progress has been made by ensuring that although certain anomalies exist, we can ensure that other layers of protection exist. The ombudsman will not be called on to investigate everything, but will be allowed to concentrate on his promotional role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister referred to people over 18 as we are discussing an ombudsman for children and the Minister of State has responsibility for children, that is persons under 18 years of age. All of the arguments which she put forward for an office of ombudsman for children are sound and we welcome the legislation and the office, but there is no justification for the exclusion of offending 16 and 17 year olds from the ombudsman's protection. The Minister cannot deny that. It may be inconvenient and I am sure that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not want any interference with the services provided by his Department as that kind of tradition clearly exists within that Department. The Minister has probably said to her that he does not want a do-gooder poking his nose into the Department's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that 16 and 17 year olds are the Minister of State's responsibility and should be the responsibility of the ombudsman. That such children are being denied access to an ombudsman is an entirely arbitrary distinction with no basis in logic nor in what we would like to see as a new approach to children. All children should <Col N="1054" /> be regarded as such and given the protection children require. The Minister, by allowing this section, is ensuring they will be excluded indefinitely. Her own amendment is meaningless and I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that when we get the annual report, we have no guarantee that the issue of the exclusion of young offenders will be raised. We have no reason to believe that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be anxious to do anything about it. Given that Department's responsibilities for prisons, the Garda, courts and so on, offending children will be low down on its list of priorities, which is why, as I stated before, it is wrong that those children continue to be its responsibility instead of coming under the Department of Education and Science. The Minister is compounding this by excluding these young people from the ombudsman's protection. Her amendment will allow a Minister to change that if that Minister so wishes.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that if the Minister were being true to the convention and best practice, she would include these children. I do not understand why they are not included. It would be important, given the history of the criminal justice system and the difficulty in creating, as she stated herself, the children's strategy which includes the aim to see children who come before the juvenile justice system being catered for by child-centred services that will aid rehabilitation and give them a future. Therefore, it is important to give the ombudsman a role and it is a shame to take away the protection of the law. When the Government next makes its presentation on the implementation of different conventions, this will emerge, and I am sure that the law will be changed.</P>

      <P>As I said at the outset, I accept that these young people should be included and that it is an anomaly that they are not, but I also accept that because the ombudsman's investigation of a complaint is to be a last port of call, we should allow the other avenues to be exhausted first. As they come in tandem with the establishment of the inspectorate of prisons, we should allow it time to establish its structures and procedures so that young people can have resort to them and then allow them access to the ombudsman. I hope that all four of us in the House now will be back after the election and that, whatever <Col N="1055" /> role we play, we will continue to press for this change to be implemented soon.</P>
      <P>I believe that these children will be included which is why the words &ldquo;shall cease to have effect&rdquo; are included in the amendment. Young people in such institutions will be included, which I am certain that we and the ombudsman will ensure. It is just not practical to do so immediately and I want to set up the office without any delay.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(9) The Ombudsman for Children may as <i>amicus curiae</i>, on his or her own initiative, refer a case to the High Court, or the Supreme Court when exercising its appellate <Col N="1056" /> jurisdiction, in respect of the contravention of a right of a child in so far as it affects the rights of all children.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have effectively discussed this already. It concerns extending the ombudsman's role so that he or she could, on his or her own initiative, refer a case to the High Court or the Supreme Court in respect of the contravention of a right of a child in so far as it affects the rights of all children. It seeks to allow the ombudsman to be a voice for children in those courts.</P>

      <P>This idea has been debated here before and the intention is that the ombudsman would complement the role of already existing people and offices, not replace them, albeit that those offices may need to be reformed and enhanced. However, this role is not envisaged for the ombudsman.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 25, to delete line 3.</P>
      <P>There is more evidence of the hand of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this legislation with the exclusion of the Garda from the remit of the ombudsman. What is the justification for this? The Schedule lists a number of agencies that have responsibility for investigation and basic service providers are included under the remit of the ombudsman. Departments, health boards and so on are included. I understand the Garda complaints board is not listed for the same reason as the Equality Authority and other inspection agencies but, as a basic service provider, the Garda must be included.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the Garda is listed as one of the bodies excluded under the Schedule. What is the difference between a child or adult making a complaint against a social worker or teacher and doing so against a garda? There is no basis for this and it is more evidence of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's complete distaste and dislike for inspection of what it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt adults and children have difficulties with the Garda. Very often children are not well served by the force and there are issues relating to alleged inappropriate handling of cases involving children. The ombudsman should have responsibility in this regard. Will the Minister of State explain why on earth the Garda is excluded from the provisions of the Schedule and why children should not be entitled to protection from inappropriate behaviour on the part of gardaí as they are from inappropriate behaviour on the part of teachers or health board person<Col N="1057" /> nel? There is no basis for this at all. Why has this provision crept into the legislation? What is the Minister of State's justification for retaining it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference in making a complaint against a teacher or social worker because there is no independent inspection process in place for them. It is conducted in-house. A new totally separate complaints procedure has been established for the Garda to deal with complaints. The legislation deals with the investigative role of bodies and because there is an independent investigation procedure in place for the Garda which is open to everybody, the Ombudsman for Children will not cover the force. Equally, the Ombudsman does not cover the Garda. A separate independent appeals mechanism exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is similar to saying that because there is an inspection service in the prisons, the Minister of State will not bring in a more specific child-oriented service such as an ombudsman to address issues that may arise. She is saying that because there is an investigation board to cover the Garda, it is not relevant to extend the remit of the ombudsman to cover the force. That argument is quite weak because the reason we are establishing an ombudsman for children is specific services are needed for children which must be child proofed, similar to equality or poverty proofing.</P>
      <P>There are specific issues relating to young people aged under 18. Different services are required if children's needs are to be put at the centre and, while there may be an investigations board, the question of how it would deal with the rights of young people who come before it or how it would promote or understand their rights would be quite different qualitatively to a service specifically targeted at helping children. It is a different body and the Minister's argument does not provide a good reason to exclude the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces are excluded but young people aged under 18 are allowed to enlist. They should not be allowed to enlist or, if they are, they should come under the remit of an ombudsman. It is ironic but this point is relevant in the context of the worldwide debate about the abuse of child soldiers in armies.</P>

      <P>It is a shame that the opportunity that has been presented by the legislation has not been fully grasped by the Minister of State to tidy the anomalies that exist in Defence Forces recruitment, the treatment of children by the Garda and the custody of children by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. These issues could have been addressed. I am aware of the difficulties in dealing with the Department, to which the concept of accountability is anathema, but the legislation provided an opportunity to force these issues. It is a pity the Minister of State has not availed of it. The Bill and her reputation would have been strengthened if she had been <Col N="1058" /> prepared to take on the Department on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We recently passed legislation to provide for an ombudsman for the Defence Forces. That will be an independent body, which will cover investigations involving young people as well as all other members of the Defence Forces. The same argument applies to the Garda. The new independent complaints body will undertake investigations.</P>
      <P>The legislation addresses individual investigations of complaints. There is a mechanism in place and the ombudsman can highlight issues relating to young people in the Army or their relationships with the Garda and detention centres. He or she will not be able to investigate individual complaints. A key role of the ombudsman will be to ensure the ombudsman for the Defence Forces deals in a child-friendly manner with young people and the Garda complaints body establishes procedures to deal with children. The opportunity exists, through the establishment of this new body, to ensure this is done.</P>
      <P>We should not try to give the ombudsman responsibility for everything. However, the office should have responsibility to ensure every group works in a more child-centred and child-friendly manner. That is the way to move forward.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their consideration of the Bill. I am reluctant to say this may be the final legislation of the 28th Dáil, but everything indicates that it may be. I thank Deputies for their role in highlighting issues relating to children. Both continually raised on the Order of Business the need for this Bill, which assisted me in getting it this far. It is important legislation and is a huge step forward for children and young people. It indicates that the Government and the House recognises the need to do more for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to move immediately to establish the office. I envisage that children will be involved in the appointment of the ombudsman to ensure he or she can relate to children, listen to them and act on their behalf. I am confident the office will help highlight to a greater degree for children and young people their rights and needs and that it will work effectively with public bodies. It will ensure we continue to put pressure on those bod<Col N="1059" /> ies to fulfil their statutory duties and that the Government continues to invest in them to provide the resources for young people which are badly needed. While recognising that a great deal has been done, a great deal needs to be done if we are to protect not just the current generation but future ones.</P>
    <P>I thank the officials in the Department of Health and Children and other Departments who had an input into this. It is simple but major legislation and a great deal of work was done on it, especially with the Attorney General's office. I thank those with whom I have worked in a wide variety of areas in child care which link into the legislation. Tá súil agam agus sinn ag teacht chun deireadh na Dála seo go mbeimid go léir ar ais anseo chun níos mó a dhéanamh ar son páistí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation and am glad it has been dealt with in this Dáil. The office has the potential to be a powerful voice for children. It is important it is well resourced and staffed and that it receives the support from Government it needs.</P>
      <P>I hope we do not see too many letters from Ministers vetoing investigations by the ombudsman. I am not happy with that part of the legislation. Deputy Shortall and I highlighted a number of areas where the legislation could have been strengthened. We also highlighted the exclusions about which we are concerned. I have no doubt that, as the office develops and as we learn from the experience, changes will be made to the role and remit. It is important the office is being established. I join the Minister of State in thanking the officials. A great deal of work is done behind the scenes on legislation such as this.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Bill will be on the Statute Book. Never was an ombudsman for children more needed in a country which is ten to 20 years behind other European countries which have this position in place. The office has the potential to be a powerful voice in a country where children have not been centre stage, as is evidenced by the information we have about child abuse in residential centres and by the shortage of places for troubled teenagers and young people. We see a chaotic and understaffed service having difficulty delivering services to children.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important because it will create a place where children's needs will be centre stage and it will influence policy and practice. I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing it through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the passage of the Bill and commend the Minister of State and her officials for the work which has gone into its preparation. The Office of Ombudsman for Children has the potential to be an extremely powerful one. The extent to which it will be depends on two factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is the calibre of the person appointed as ombudsman. We have discussed this and it is <Col N="1060" /> self-evident in many ways but it is critical that the person appointed understands children and their needs. That might be a simple thing to say, but there are many people, sometimes in senior office in Departments, who are far removed from where children are at. A good academic and service record does not necessarily guarantee that a person will be good in dealing with children's issues. The selection of the person is critical.</P>
    <P>The other point is that the office will only be as effective as the extent to which it is resourced. We all accept, irrespective of political differences, that a vast amount of work remains to be done in terms of upholding and protecting the rights of children. Our record over many years has been abysmal in this area. There are major issues relating to children, especially those classified as disadvantaged, where we do not provide the type of protection and services they require. It could be argued and the case has been made that there was a better protection service ten years ago because there were public health nurses, parents were more involved in the rearing of their children and there was a greater sense of community. Much of that has been lost and for that reason many children are being left to their own devices and are in serious danger of neglect or abuse.</P>
    <P>A vast amount of work remains to be done. We have a poor history as a country in the area of children's rights. We have much ground to make up and I hope the new ombudsman will play a key role in bringing our services up to a modern standard which will ensure children's rights are protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis áthais dom labhairt sa Dáil faoin tuarascáil an-tábhachtach seo ón Bórd Náisiúnta Árachais Gluaisteáin.</P>
      <P>As public representatives, we are all well aware of the increasing difficulties regarding the availability and price of liability insurance. A non-exhaustive list of the reasons for this would include the level of claims, the increasing level of awards, poor investment returns, the substantial increase in reinsurance costs, the implementation of recent court judgments, legal costs and the method for determining them, foreign insurers opting out of the Irish market, the increase in the capital base of insurance undertakings required to support increased premium income and the reluctance of parent companies to invest capital in insurance undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature and scope of these difficulties require a response which is multifaceted in its approach and which would include the following actions: Government support for the excellent report presented by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, with the preparation of an action plan for the implementation of its many recommendations within three months; a speedy Government <Col N="1061" /> response in due course to what will emerge from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board report, which is nearing completion, including taking a strong stance on hostile reactions; further improvements in health and safety measures; encouragement of the Irish Insurance Federation to adopt a policy that &ldquo;any firm that has a claims free record for a number of years with a particular insurance undertaking will not face significant increases in premium&rdquo;; and pressing the EU for greater action on making the single market for insurance products a reality throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to publish last week the large report from the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. This is the most comprehensive study and analysis of the Irish motor insurance industry ever undertaken in this country. I reiterate my deepest appreciation to all of the board members. Thanks to their dedication, this huge report has been completed with professionalism and tenacity. An enormous amount of work has been undertaken in the period since I first legally established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in September 1998, under SI 299/84 and SI 359/94. The new board commenced its great challenge, under the chairmanship of Ms Dorothea Dowling, who previously worked for 16 years in the insurance industry in Dublin and London. This board represents a wide range of interests, including insurance users and providers, consumers, road safety and road traffic interests, accident victims and young drivers. The report has clearly benefited from the combined wisdom of all board members. The key findings of the report are detailed in the following paragraphs.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board is firmly of the view that because motor insurance against third party injury and damage is compulsory, it must be open to public scrutiny, with which we all agree. The high cost of insurance in Ireland compared with the rest of Europe is underlined in the report. Motor insurance is one of the biggest bills a household faces in a year. The main sections of this report reflect the fact that the cost of insurance is determined by three main factors &ndash; accidents, in terms of both their frequency and severity; the cost of claims within the current compensation system; and the operation of the insurance market. The board makes it clear that tackling one of these factors, without giving the required attention to the others, is unlikely to achieve better value for money for law-abiding motorists, the majority of whom have never been involved in a culpable accident.</P>
    <P>The report stresses that tackling the current cost of motor insurance is not a party political issue, since the state of affairs now obtaining was not achieved overnight. Successive Administrations have failed to tackle the vested interests and inefficiencies that collectively may account for as much as half of the premiums paid by law abiding motorists. The board pointed out that while its recommendations are not presented in any order of priority, many are inter-related to <Col N="1062" /> the extent that objectives are only likely to be achieved by co-ordinated action in a number of areas. It underlines the fact that long-term measures are required for success.</P>
    <P>The board contends that the current situation suits too many interests: the State, which collect a 2% stamp duty on premiums and presumably appropriate levels of taxes from all of the various parties who profit; the legal profession &ndash; the report records the refusal by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland to make a submission to the board; and insurers who regard returns at 4.2% as too low. The report points out that it is of interest that although insurers in Ireland and the UK assert that returns to shareholders are inadequate, motor insurers in Ireland &ndash; where claims costs are one of the highest in Europe &ndash; reported 11 times the total post-tax profit earned by their UK counterparts between 1983 and 1999.</P>
    <P>This is the first time the Motor Insurance Advisory Board has secured access to insurers raw data on premium income and claims costs, on which detailed analyses are presented in this report. However, insurers have not yet been able to submit their raw data for the year 2000 to the board for analysis. When that work has been completed, a supplementary report will be provided by the board, which will also examine further the area of commercial motor insurance, as well as providing any available indications of the effect that the introduction of the euro has had on premium charges and related matters.</P>
    <P>The report confirms the evidence that young male drivers, aged between 17 and 20 years on provisional licences, produce very substantial insurance losses. They are involved in accidents resulting in most serious claims at a frequency which is disproportionate to their representation as policyholders. There is evidence, too, that charges for young female policyholders are not justified by their claims costs, and these policyholders have been described by insurers as subsidisers. This situation has now been acknowledged by the insurance industry and I am informed that it has already converted into reduced quotations for some.</P>
    <P>The board notes the complaints that it received in written submissions from senior citizens and consumers with disabilities and predicts that, on the basis of demographic projections, in the future the problems associated with insurers declining a risk on grounds of age currently faced by young drivers may be experienced by people who have retired. The report indicates that the consequences of uninsured driving are becoming more acute, and the MIAB now estimates that they add 8% to the cost of claims in the aggregate motor insurance market. However, unlike other businesses, a substantial proportion of expenditure declared by insurers relates to reserves established to meet claims which will not be paid until many years into the future. The board does not consider that the market for private motor insurance is competitive.</P>
    <P>The fact that motor insurance is compulsory differentiates it from other products or services, <Col N="1063" /> since there is a limit to the usual market forces dictated by consumers who may decide not to purchase or may elect to substitute cheaper alternatives. The real choice available to the consumer is dominated by a handful of legal entities, with three companies accounting for 67% of the market. The board says it has become aware of a practice, which it believes should not be permitted, of motor quotes being refused unless the proposer has his or her household or other insurance placed with the insurer.</P>
    <P>The board is of the view that the imperfect state of the market is such that consumers' concerns are unlikely to be allayed without an investigation by the Competition Authority, which has the benefit of procedures not available to the board. In the meantime, it counsels against consumer inertia, advising that it is absolutely essential to shop around, before renewing insurance, in order to obtain the most competitive quotation, as charges between companies can vary by 200% for the same risk.</P>
    <P>As the report makes clear, the free movement principle in EU law means that no citizen can be compelled to purchase insurance from a particular provider or in particular circumstances. Equally, the pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual companies and EU law has always prevented the Irish Government from intervening to freeze, reduce or increase prices. As of now, a major disparity with the rest of Europe, according to this report is the fact that in the UK and Ireland, motor insurance is based on driver use, rather than on the vehicle itself, with usage being secondary to issues of cover. The report recommends aligning the situation in Ireland with that of mainland Europe, through appropriate amendment to the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    <P>The board has expressed continuing concern that an appropriate balance be struck between the rights of consumers and the objectives of solvency supervision which up to now have been assigned the overwhelming priority. In that context, the report refers to the daunting task to be faced by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, in regulating general insurance in the best interest of consumers. The report recommends that, when IFSRA assumes responsibility for motor insurance, a framework of general insurance standards should be established incorporating the principle of good faith dealing.</P>
    <P>The board believes that consumer knowledge of comparative prices could be facilitated by a consumer information service provided electronically by IFSRA, which would set out illustrative tables for standard motor insurance over a range of common driver profiles. The Government's intention to establish a statutory office of ombudsman within IFSRA is welcomed by the board, provided that the statutory provision will not mirror the unsatisfactory state of affairs under the industry's ombudsman scheme, where <Col N="1064" /> the greatest proportion of non-life complaints relate to motor insurance and the vast majority of those fall outside the ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <P>At the heart of all of the 67 recommendations in this report is the question of balance between the complementary interests of the citizen and the insurer. On the one hand, policyholders must be satisfied that the system is being managed efficiently and is fulfilling its primary function, that of cost-effective delivery of compensation to genuine victims of accidents. On the other hand, there needs to be a healthy, vibrant insurance industry which is capable of competing in Europe in a cost effective way. Ultimately, it is the policyholders who pay all claims. There needs to be a balance between those who attempt to allege injuries or exaggerate claims and those policyholders who are wrongly sued and who are entitled to have their constitutional rights upheld. Up to now, the focus has been virtually entirely on the regulatory end of the sector. There needs to be a balance between prudential supervision and consumer protection, including accountability and transparency, which will arm consumers with the relevant information.</P>
    <P>I have had an annotated version of the recommendations prepared, a copy of which can be found at www.entemp.ie/cr/miab.pdf. For ease of reference, the annotated document, extracts the 67 recommendations from this report and in each case indicates the issues addressed and the body responsible for their implementation. The Government is fully supportive of the broad thrust of the recommendations and has every confidence that their implementation will result in a much fairer system. In broad terms, the potential for reduced insurance costs arising from the implementation of the many recommendations should impact favourably on the viability of enterprises and job opportunities for young people.</P>
    <P>The availability of affordable motor insurance to run private vehicles would contribute significantly to the economic and social well-being of people living in rural communities. Potential savings in the overhead cost of delivering compensation which would have a favourable impact on the cost of all types of liability insurance have been identified in the report. Implementation of the recommendations overall would, therefore, have a beneficial impact in an area of particular concern to SMEs.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that there will be no delay in preparing an action plan. The Government has mandated me to set up a high level implementation group to immediately progress the recommendations and to report not later than three months from its inaugural meeting. The group, which met for the first time today, is chaired by the assistant secretary in the insurance and company law division of my Department. It is representative of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, the Environment and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social, Community and <Col N="1065" /> Family Affairs, the Consumers Association of Ireland, IBEC and the MIAB chair. The membership of the implementation group includes representatives of the Departments that will be primarily responsible for giving effect to the recommendations.</P>
    <P>Of the 67 recommendations, 17 relate directly to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and, without wishing to pre-empt the outcome of the work of the implementation group, I am prepared to accept them in principle. In three cases, Nos. 39, 59 and 60, primary legislation will be required while six, Nos. 9, 13 to 16, inclusive, and 19, call for secondary legislation. I must now examine how best to give effect to recommendations Nos. 29 to 33, inclusive. Of the remaining three, I expect the declined cases committee to meet regarding Nos. 20 and 21 to agree the necessary changes on an administrative basis, but action does not appear to be necessary on No. 64 on the basis that the issue has been addressed, albeit in a different way, in the Competition Act, 2002.</P>
    <P>In response to recommendations Nos. 13 and 14, I am pleased to inform the House that I am introducing new regulations, with full Government approval, requiring insurers to give adequate and proper notice of the terms of the annual renewal of each individual's motor insurance policy in the future. This will mean that the consumer and motorist will receive at least 15 days written notice of renewal terms, with an official certificate of no claims bonus showing each individual's record of accident-free driving up to the date of issue of the certificate.</P>
    <P>This week I forwarded the draft regulations to the Attorney General for his approval. Many consumers become totally frustrated as they do not get enough notice of the terms of the renewal of motor insurance and late notice is an obstacle to the consumer's ability to shop around, at least for those who have a choice of service provider. These regulations are part of a framework of supports that I have endeavoured to put in place to empower consumers, all of whom I urge to shop around when renewing their motor insurance. These regulations, when brought into force, will assist consumers to do just that and I will ensure that they legally get that choice.</P>
    <P>As mandated by the Government, I have referred recommendations Nos. 41, 65, 66 and 67 of the report to the Competition Authority and recommendations Nos. 6, 9, 10, 11 and 45 to the Equality Authority asking them to take necessary action. The Government has also approved referral of this report by me to the Irish Insurance Federation for its immediate response to the ten recommendations where responsibility for implementation lies with it. These can be found on pages 11, 13, and 24 to 26 of the annotated version of the recommendations. I am happy to inform the House that the board has agreed to my proposal for a six month extension of its remit up to 31 December 2002. The extension, which has the approval of Government, is designed to <Col N="1066" /> enable the board not just to prepare the supplementary report mentioned earlier, but also to monitor and report progress on the many recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>In common with every other Member of this House, I have been concerned for some time about the high cost of motor insurance, particularly for young drivers. I do not pretend that this report provides a quick fix solution to immediately bring about significant reductions in insurance premiums, but it provides a road map to enable us to set out to address a long-standing and unsatisfactory state of affairs which has been the cause of considerable public disquiet. On my own behalf and that of my Government colleagues, I make a commitment to ensure that the necessary action is taken to give effect to the many recommendations in the report. These 67 wide-ranging recommendations chart the way to a system of insurance that is fairer for all and more equitable in terms of the relationship between the risk and the premium paid by the user. They signpost the way to make the system serve the 21st century consumer.</P>
    <P>The issues involved will have to be tackled without delay which is the reason I wasted no time in establishing the implementation group to oversee our response. My intention is that the comprehensive action plan to be prepared by the implementation group will be presented to Government and published in the interests of transparency and public information. I am sure the House will join me in wishing the implementation group every success in its task of bringing this work to the next stage. The group and the Motor Insurance Advisory Board will continue to have my full assistance and support and this historic report will turn out to have been the catalyst in effecting positive change in motor insurance in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's speech can be summed up in the phrase &ldquo;road map&rdquo; which he used to describe the report. He says it is a map or a signpost and I say to him that the finding by him of a map after five years spent searching is indicative of the Government's performance in this area. The Dáil is on its last legs and we will certainly not have the opportunity to discuss this matter again &ndash; we will probably not have the opportunity to discuss any matter of significance in its lifetime. The record of the Minister of State and his Department as far as insurance is concerned will be summed up in his own comment. He has now found a road map to the future after five years and he advises people to shop around. The availability of motor insurance is reflected in an old time phrase used with regard to accessing justice and the law and there is no greater truism in society in spring 2002. Motor insurance is compulsory and open to all, just like the Ritz Hotel. It is a scandal that matter has been on the Minister of State's desk in the many years since he first took office. He has promised much and spoken at great length <Col N="1067" /> about the problems, but, regrettably, has done nothing to bring about a solution.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister of State refused to take action until such time as last week's comprehensive report was published, when the dogs in the streets were barking about some of the problems which were obvious to everybody, particularly young people. The Minister of State refused to take action, in particular in regard to the role and function of the Competition Authority which was not in a position to act on any matter pertaining to insurance until a direct query was referred to it by the Government. Regrettably, that did not happen, although it was stated by sources close to the authority that much work could have been done. After five years talking about the problem the Minister of State has finally decided to refer certain issues to the authority.</P>
      <P>The report contains 67 recommendations, many if not most of which have been well flagged and debated in this House. Were it not for the inertia of the Minister of State and his Department many of these issues could be at an advanced state of resolution. It is interesting to look at those 67 recommendations, which the Minister of State has divided up for ease of reference according to number, issues addressed, action recommended, parties responsible for implementation and commentary. One would have thought the commentary might have flagged the implementation process, what the Minister would do and the road map and signposts he speaks of. However, there is no comment as far as 26 of the recommendations are concerned. Some 26 of the recommendations are not worthy of any comment from the Minister in terms of his action while there is a kind of &ldquo;would be&rdquo; attitude to 24 of them. What needs to be done is set out but its implementation would require changing court procedure, changing court rules and changing the court service review. &ldquo;Would&rdquo; seems to be the operational buzz word&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;in 24 of the recommendations. The Minister of State has done nothing and now he is setting out what would be done in certain circumstances &ndash; what would be done if he wished it to happen and what would be done if he had the intention or political will to introduce the proposals. While he referred to some of the remaining 17 recommendations, there is no comment in regard to 26 recommendations, &ldquo;would be&rdquo; in regard to 24 recommendations and there is a woolly commitment, couched in almost aspirational terms, in regard to the remaining 17 recommendations. It is totally unsatisfactory that following publication of the report, and the Minister sitting around for five years doing nothing, he has come up with 17 rather woolly recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" />A young man came to my clinic the week before last with a renewal form for a 1990 Volkswagen golf, NCT passed, with a value of &euro;1,000. The insurance premium notification was for &euro;7,500 which is totally unacceptable. It is extraordinary that such a millstone has been placed around the necks of young people as far as driving a car is concerned. The Acting Chairman, the Minister and I, who come from rural constituencies, know that a car is essential to allow one travel to and from work.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the insurance levy collected by the Government in recent years but he did not tell us the money goes directly into the general Exchequer. There is no reference to insurance. Since the Minister took up office &euro;38.66 million was collected in 1997. This increased to &euro;42 million in 1998, &euro;48 million in 1999, &euro;56 million in 2000 and &euro;69 million in 2001. A total of &euro;250 million has been creamed off since the Government took up office in 1997. On the basis of preventive measures about which we all talk in terms of reducing the number of accidents and claims, and in order to relieve the burden in terms of cost, I would have thought the money would have been directed into areas of road safety and education to ensure the number of road traffic accidents giving rise to the large number of claims could be addressed and, if not, minimised. It is unacceptable that such a large sum of money, taken directly as a levy on motor insurance premia, should be funnelled into the general Exchequer rather than being ring-fenced.</P>
    <P>I am surprised the Minister of State did not refer in his speech to any recommendation with which he could deal by way of a stroke of a pen. He hinted in a public statement that he was not happy with the Courts Bill, 2001, which was passed late one night just before the Easter recess. Will that Bill be enacted? Has it been signed into law by his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Does the Minister of State have the power to stop it &ndash; he said outside the House that he might? He did not confirm to the House today whether it is his intention to have a word with his colleague to have the legislation repealed before the ink on the final enactment is dry. This is a very fine example of the Government being totally at sea or there being absolutely no communication or interest between Departments on the way forward. It amazes me that committee legislation can be passed by this House the week before the publication of a report, which runs contrary to the recommendations in the report, and there is no comment from the Minister during his first opportunity in the House to discuss the terms of what he calls his road map or signpost. I ask the Minister where now stands the Courts Bill? If there is provision for him to reply to the debate, I would ask him to deal with this point.</P>
    <P>There have been allegations in the public arena for years of cartels and a closed shop in the motor <Col N="1069" /> insurance industry. These allegations were not investigated by the Government. It did not ask the Competition Authority to look at the issue so that the matter could at least be put to bed one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system was another debacle in which his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was involved. A five year old child would say that unless there is a deterrent to stop speeding motorists and prevent drivers from engaging in dangerous driving there will be accidents and, if there are accidents, there will be claims and, if there are claims, there will be costs. The penalty points system would act as a deterrent in that I know if I am caught speeding in Limerick today and in Portlaoise tomorrow the two speeding offences will be recorded against me and there will not be the free for all which now exists whereby there is no way of checking the recording of a speeding summons against an individual in any part of the country unless a garda recognises there is an element of habitual offending. Given the technological advances of which the Minister with responsibility for science and technology speaks in such glowing terms in other fora, surely it is not impossible to have a computer recorded system which would record offences against an individual to ensure a points system would act as a deterrent against continuous and habitual offenders. Most of the work on the Assessment of Damages Board was done during the lifetime of a previous Government. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has not moved this issue on one centimetre since taking up office in 1997.</P>
    <P>Investment in road safety law enforcement should be a priority. While there are signs for speeding cameras between here and my constituency I know, as does every other road user, that there are no cameras. There are signs for cameras to act as a deterrent but there are no cameras in place simply because there has not been investment in road safety measures either by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, or his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. The courts procedure and guidelines for the Judiciary urging a greater degree of consistency has been bandied about this House for many years. It is obvious there is a lack of consistency among judges whereby huge awards can be made one day and not such big awards the following day, depending on what judge is sitting. This type of lottery will continue unless there is greater consistency, together with clearer guidelines and a streamlined approach which does not mean every case has to go to the High Court giving rise to very high consequential costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Seventh Progress Report on Parliament, which was published at the end of March, has recently been circulated to all Departments for consideration.</P>
      <P>In so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, in April 1998, I wrote to the all-party committee asking it to examine how people living in Northern Ireland might play a more active part in national political life, to the extent that they so desire and in a spirit consistent with the principles underlying the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the committee which agreed to undertake this review as part of its wider review of the institutions of the State. In undertaking this aspect of its work, the committee had the benefit of submissions received from a number of organisations and individuals, including the SDLP and Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>I deeply appreciate the thoughtful manner in which the committee has approached this sensitive matter. It has sought to ensure that nothing it proposed was at variance with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. Its conclusions are fully consistent with that approach.</P>
      <P>The committee states its belief that the establishment of a North-South Joint Parliamentary Forum, to bring together representatives of the Oireachtas and of the Northern Ireland Assembly, as well as the establishment of an independent consultative forum appointed by the Administrations, representative of civil society, both of which are proposed in the Good Friday Agreement, could make a major contribution to dialogue and mutual understanding between North and South. The Government fully shares this view and would wish to see early progress achieved in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the committee's view that it could be particularly valuable from time to time to have the expertise, experience and insight of politicians from Northern Ireland in appropriate debates in the Oireachtas. The Government therefore supports making the necessary procedural arrangements to allow MPs elected for Northern Ireland constituencies to speak in periodic debates on Northern Ireland matters and on the operation of the Good Friday Agreement, as envisaged by the committee, and will seek the assistance of other <Col N="1071" /> parties in the Dáil to bring this about as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>The committee rightly points to the valuable precedent established by the contributions of past and present Senators from the North in the Seanad. I fully agree that it would be valuable to extend and to formalise this existing practice. The committee brings forward a range of options, some of which would require amendment of the Constitution. These deserve careful consideration and we will seek to move forward on the basis of the maximum political consensus to achieve an outcome that will provide, as soon as practicable, for a permanent presence from Northern Ireland in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The committee also suggests, in the context of an enlarged role in the scrutiny of EU business envisaged for the Seanad, that consideration could be given to allowing MEPs elected in the State and Northern Ireland to speak in periodic debates on EU matters. The Government supports taking the necessary procedural steps that would facilitate such an initiative. I issued a statement to this effect regarding Northern Ireland following the publication of the all-party report at the end of March.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of participation by representatives from the Northern Ireland Assembly or MPs who are Westminster representatives from Northern Ireland participating in either the deliberations of the Seanad or Dáil or committees of same, has the Taoiseach any suggestions as to whether by participating in a debate it would be necessary to have the Constitution changed or could <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements be made to facilitate such an exchange either through the committee structure or through formal sittings of the Dáil and Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to some of the matters, for example the North-South parliamentary tier, we could make progress on some of these issues on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis but the more formal matters of the Seanad and the restructuring of the Seanad would definitely be constitutional issues. We probably could make progress on the basis of certain individual debates and make our own standing orders for them. The report's findings on the Seanad and the restructuring of the Seanad, which is what it is about, and the present representational role of the Seanad, are that that would be a constitutional matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach find it somewhat strange if not contradictory that the President of Sinn Féin, whose party has been to the forefront in demanding equal access to the Houses of the Oireachtas for democratically elected members in Northern Ireland to either the Assembly or to Westminster, declined the invitation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Oireachtas to come and speak to it on a matter of considerable importance to every<Col N="1072" /> body on this island? Does the Taoiseach find that at odds with the repeated demands from that party for a presence, for a representation and for an audience either by right or as an extension of the Constitution? Does he have any comment to make on that contradictory position? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly that is matter for the President of Sinn Féin. So far as it relates to what we are doing, if we make arrangements that allow for debate and dialogue they would have to be on the basis that people will turn up, otherwise there is not much point in us doing that. Any future changes we make would have to be on the understanding that there would be participation. As well as the parliamentary tier, an independent consultative forum representative of civil society is envisaged. Deputy Quinn will recall that this issue was raised three or four years ago. Following the recent meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council an institutional format was agreed that consultation should be initiated with the social partners. Both of these would make a major contribution to dialogue and reaching an understanding between North and South and would give us an opportunity to move on that tier which was also envisaged and not just the parliamentary one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Seanad should not be a mere carbon copy of the Dáil as it is now with the same type of party lines adopted and whip system in place? Does he agree we should all be committed to making the Seanad a place where a genuine second look at legislative proposals can take place? Does he also agree that if we are to proceed on the basis of negotiation and representation, as suggested in his reply, that effectively would give a veto to people who do not want to participate? Does he not think it would be better to give certain categories of representatives in the North a right of audience in the Seanad, such as MEPs and probably Members of the Legislative Assembly, and then it would be up to them to take up that opportunity when they so wish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee set out a range of views and it is a matter for it as to how it works those out. Deputy Mitchell is correct in stating that the committee is examining this matter in the context of the reform of the Seanad and not in the context of the Northern element being the same as it is today. The task going forward will be to examine how we can structure that. In whatever structure emerges, there should be a permanent presence from Northern Ireland in the Seanad, which, in effect, there has been for almost 25 years to 30 years.</P>

      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect &ndash; I can hardly at this point ask when he intends &ndash; that the necessary steps will be taken to facilitate the implementation of the measures recommended in the all-party commit<Col N="1073" /> tee's report, in particular the matter of access for Northern MPs to the Dáil Chamber and to specified Dáil debates? Does he envisage that such access will be enhanced and expanded in the months and years ahead? Does he accept that in response to the invitation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs the Sinn Féin President and this Deputy did not decline but sought clarification and have not ruled out an opportunity at a future appropriate date yet to be determined? For the record, we also responded to questions posed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy said in the last part of his question is correct. I am sure that will happen in due course.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first part of his question, it will take some time to get the process moving, but the setting up of a North-South joint inter-parliamentary forum could move ahead quickly. That would be an initial step and it should not be too difficult to arrange. I have sent this report to all Departments and all the relevant agencies and asked them to go ahead with making the necessary examinations. That work is ongoing and, hopefully, we will be able to come to some conclusions and move on to set up a North-South joint inter-parliamentary forum as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Mr. Justice Barron expects to be in a position to submit his report on the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings in the autumn. Among the enormous amount of <Col N="1074" /> material which the judge has received in relation to his work, he has had a response from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Mr. Justice Barron has recently initiated further contact with the Secretary of State's office seeking additional information and clarification he requires to complete his inquiry.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter for Mr. Justice Barron to assess and comment in his report on the co-operation he has received from all of the various authorities with which he has been in contact. The costs to date relating to the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings amount to &euro;688,863.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Taoiseach aware, as revealed last Sunday, that the British Government's lawyers were preparing a defence of sovereign immunity in the event of a case being taken by bereaved relatives and survivors of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings? Such a defence is invoked by a government to protect itself from culpability for the actions of its agents and was used by the former dictator, General Pinochet, when extradition warrants were served by a number of European states, including Spain, when he was in Britain. What is the Taoiseach's response to these revelations?</P>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach stated, in response to questions I put to him on the same issue, that a large amount of material was supplied to Mr. Justice Barron by the British authorities. Were the documents relating to this line of defence, that of sovereign immunity, included in the documentation provided to Mr. Justice Barron? What is the extent of the material requested by the judge that is still outstanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked three questions. On the matter of the issues raised in last week's Sunday newspapers, I am aware that Justice for the Forgotten was in the process of bringing a case against the British authorities in relation to the bombings, but it did not proceed with that when the independent commission of inquiry was established some years ago.</P>
      <P>In relation to the article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, I do not know the status of the correspondence referred to therein and whether it represents a formal or finalised position of the British Government on the question of its bringing a possible case. I hope the British authorities will co-operate fully with Mr. Justice Barron and that he will be in a position to establish the truth and to find out who is responsible for what happened. That is the main focus of his current efforts. It would not be wise for us to try to anticipate or speculate on the judge's possible findings on specific aspects of the issues he is examining, of which I am not aware. The task of the Government at this stage is to support the judge in every possible way in order that he can complete his work as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have raised the <Col N="1075" /> Dublin and Monaghan bombings with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on many occasions. The British authorities are well aware that there is an independent commission of inquiry examining all aspects of the bombings. Whatever about the question of any legal options the British authorities might have been considering in the event of legal proceedings being taken before the commission of inquiry was established, I would not wish to do anything that might in any way be considered to cut across the work of Mr. Justice Barron and his team.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that Mr. Justice Barron must now be left to pursue all the relevant matters and I will continue to support him in any way I can. I am not aware if any of those papers were in the papers given to Mr. Justice Barron, but I very much doubt that is the case.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked about the papers that were transferred. In order to be absolutely clear about what I said on this matter last week, I will restate what I said to make sure the position is clear. I answered supplementary questions to Deputy Ó Caoláin and others last week. I said that I was aware that Mr. Justice Barron has acquired an enormous amount of material in respect of the inquiry generally. I hope I did not convey the impression that all that material came from the British files. I was talking about the enormous amount of material he has gathered, which has come from numerous sources, Departments, agencies and elsewhere. I am not saying that all the material came from the British files; in actual fact, that was limited enough.</P>
    <P>As I said last week, the judge wants more material. While he got extracts, I know he has gone back to the British authorities to try to ensure that he gets all the information and clarification he requires. He has not yet received that. I do not want to give the impression that he got all that he wished to get. Maybe what he got was all that was available, but that is a different matter. He has not got all that he wished to get. We will continue to support him.</P>
    <P>Since Question Time last week, my officials have been in touch with Prime Minister Blair's office again reiterating that we want as much material as is available and that we hope that Mr. Justice Barron receives more assistance than he has received to date. I think I correctly relayed the position that Mr. Justice Barron is not satisfied about this matter. While he is satisfied that he has gathered an enormous amount of material, he has not gathered an enormous amount of material from the British authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the newspaper reports of the British proposing to plead sovereign immunity, will the Taoiseach clarify if he has tried to ascertain either through political or diplomatic channels whether there is any substance to those reports and, if so, will he comment on the gravity of what that means?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position is that we totally support Mr. Justice Barron and we are not trying to get behind any other issues in relation to this. I have outlined my position regarding what might have gone on prior to the inquiry but there has been no talk of legal action that I am aware of since the inquiry. To reply to Deputy Mitchell, my officials have several times made clear to the British Prime Minister that we want full co-operation and full disclosure of as much information as they can give us. They are not involved in any legal matters at this stage and any such matters probably arose prior to the inquiry being set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be useful for clarity to put this on the record as this Dáil comes to a conclusion. The intention of the Barron inquiry &ndash; previously the Hamilton inquiry &ndash; was to establish, <i>prima facie</i>, whether there were sufficient evidence and grounds for a proper tribunal of inquiry into this matter. Following completion of the report, I hope it can proceed to a conclusion in August. Does the Taoiseach agree that, as he agreed to a request from me, the Barron report on publication should be referred to a relevant Oireachtas committee in the first instance? Following evaluation by that committee of the report a decision could be taken by the Oireachtas whether to proceed with a full inquiry. Will the Taoiseach confirm that that is the correct understanding of the procedure we are following? Which committee does he envisage the report will be referred to? Without prejudicing the conclusions of the report, is he confident that we could get to the stage of a full inquiry or, from what he knows already, is it likely that the documentation available to Mr. Justice Barron will not in itself be sufficient to warrant a full public inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was envisaged that the report prepared by Mr. Justice Barron and the work by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton would be submitted to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, as originally agreed with Opposition parties and the representatives of Justice for the Forgotten. The Government envisioned that the committee would consider, in public session, a follow-up to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government sees three approaches open to the committee at that stage. First, it could advise that the report achieved the objective of finding out the truth about what happened as far as possible. Second, it could advise that the report did not achieve that objective, which could only be done through a public inquiry. Third, it could advise that the committee did not achieve its objective and it or a sub-committee could examine the matter further. That is still the position. In the event of the last option it would be a matter for the committee to take its own legal advice to help it proceed from there. Mr. Justice Barron hopes to have his report completed in the autumn <Col N="1077" /> so when the Dáil resumes then we should be in that position.</P>

      <P>In response to my initial question the Taoiseach referred to a response last week and stated that he hoped he had not given the wrong impression in relation to the extent of material released by the British authorities. That was the impression I took from the Taoiseach's reply last week and the presentation of my question today was influenced by that opinion. Others would have taken the same view because Justice for the Forgotten commented on that response late last week. Given the Taoiseach is now clarifying that the British authorities did not supply a large amount of material but something considerably less, and not knowing the extent of material requested by the judge which is still outstanding, what further steps can the Taoiseach take to encourage greater co-operation with Mr. Justice Barron, who intends to report during the autumn? The Taoiseach's response today continues to give rise to concerns that we are not getting the co-operation essential to allow Mr. Justice Barron to move forward with his inquiry.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach join me, and others, I hope, in voicing concern at reports that the British Government was in the course of preparing a defence based on sovereign immunity, as exposed by <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday? It is generally recognised that the adoption of such a course by the British Government is, as others have speculated, tantamount to an acknowledgement of culpability if not direct involvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last matter, in discussions with me the British Government has not stated that that is its present position. When legal action was pending against it on a previous occasion I presume people would have looked at the legal defence, although I do not have information about this. That is what is in the reports but Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry would have overtaken events &ndash; all our discussions over the past two and a half years have been on the basis of his work.</P>
      <P>I have clarified the first matter but I restate that I am glad we have the records and data, which include some extracts from files. That said, however, it does not adequately address the questions raised by Mr. Justice Barron. Regarding Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, two issues arise and Mr. Justice Barron has been back in contact with the British authorities to ensure he gets all the clarification and information he requires. We have also been in contact with the British authorities and the Prime Minister's officials formally to state that we want more information given. My difficulty is that I cannot be sure if the information exists or is available. I can only relate to the House that Mr. Justice Barron feels that information is available and he is endeavouring to get it. We are giving official and political support to try to achieve that.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach did not answer my question and I ask it again. In view of the daily and hourly contact that appears to take place at official and political levels between the Irish and British authorities, has a question been put at any level to the British authorities about their pleading sovereign immunity since <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> report? If not, why has that question not been put?</P>

      <P>If we were to follow up every article in every newspaper we would be on to them an awful lot more. I know what the British Government's position is now. It has only been a matter of days. We were on to them regarding the point I discussed with Deputy Ó Caoláin. That is the point. I am trying to get co-operation.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the British position, from the whole period since the Barron inquiry started, has been based on that. Prior to that the Justice for the Forgotten group was going to take legal action. In that case, although I do not have facts on it, the British Government would have been working to provide its legal defence on that. We contacted it very recently &ndash; in the past few days or late last week &ndash; and probably on a daily basis and there is nothing new about legal action from British sources. Normally they would communicate these issues to us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Justice for the Forgotten group is concerned about the implementation of the Victims' Commission report which was published in 1999 and which was due to be implemented within six months. Quite a number of the report's 35 recommendations have not been implemented.</P>
      <P>I draw the Taoiseach's attention to recommendation No. 16 which deals with acknowledgement payments for bereaved families. These people are awaiting the conclusion of Mr. Justice Barron's report. The recommendation proposes the establishment of a trust fund in respect of these and other victims. Can the Taoiseach give the House an indication as to when these recommendations, particularly recommendation No. 16, will be implemented? Such a development would take away some of the sense of hurt and grievance which people feel in terms of recognition. They may not get the facts, but at least they would receive some recognition for the hurt and injury they endured over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have all the details regarding the recommendations, but the Government and I are mindful of the pain and trauma which the victims of violence in Northern Ireland have suffered over a long period. It is important to ensure an appropriate and sympathetic response by the State to the needs of those who suffered so much. An official in my Department has been assigned to monitor the implementation <Col N="1079" /> of the recommendations in the report and he has been dealing with those recommendations involving financial assistance.</P>
      <P>As a variation on the recommendations in the report, the Government has agreed in principle to the establishment of a trust fund to address the financial needs of victims and their families in this jurisdiction which is analogous to the memorial fund in Northern Ireland. A working group of officials from relevant Departments is drawing up detailed proposals for the operation of the fund. The group has been established with a view to reporting to Government within a reasonable period &ndash; by the end of June. The amount of money to be made available to the trust has not been decided. A number of other recommendations are being dealt with by other Departments and are ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The next PPF plenary meeting will take place on 29 April. The main items on the agenda are public service modernisation, including better regulation, and waste management. In accordance with normal practice, the meeting will provide an opportunity to review progress and to deal with any issues of particular concern at the time.</P>
      <P>As with all PPF plenary meetings, a detailed progress report has been produced for this meeting setting out for each Department, including my own, the progress being made under each action point in the PPF. The eighth report, copies of which have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library, records the continuing good progress in implementing the economic, social and structural development agenda set out in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the areas of the PPF which are my specific responsibility, my Department exercises the main co-ordinating role for overall implemen<Col N="1080" /> tation of the programme as well as supporting a range of cross-departmental issues, such as public service modernisation, quality customer service, better regulation, infrastructure delivery, social inclusion and the information society.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department chairs the National Implementation Body which was established under the adjustments to the terms of the PPF in December 2000. This body continues to meet as necessary to consider, in particular, the potential implications of any ongoing disputes of special national importance.</P>
    <P>I meet representatives of individual social partner organisations on a regular basis, in addition to the annual attendance of the Taoiseach and other Ministers at the PPF plenary meeting in the summer &ndash; usually in July &ndash; in accordance with established practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked for my views as to whether there should be a new national agreement when the PPF expires. I have no hesitation in saying that there should be a new agreement. Social partnership has played a very significant role in the radical transformation of this country's economic and social fortunes since 1987 and this has been acknowledged by employer and trade union representatives in their recent statements. I have noted what people have been saying about the possibility of a return to local level bargaining. We all need to think hard about the implications of such a development in terms of competitiveness, employment and social justice.</P>
    <P>The experience of the past shows that, in a free for all, the strong tend to prosper at the expense of the weak. This applies to employers and employees, as well as to those looking for a job and those outside the labour market.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the associated danger of a return to the damaging wage price inflationary spiral and wide-scale industrial relations instability which we experienced in the past and in which, ultimately, we were all the losers.</P>
    <P>It is also important to bear in mind that social partnership agreements have not only been about pay. They have allowed the social partners to bring their differing interests, perspectives and expertise to bear in helping to tackle a wide range of complex and interdependent issues of common concern, and in embedding a pro-development approach in our culture and society. These partnership agreements have delivered. It was by working together in a disciplined way that we achieved success in the past in reducing the national debt, promoting enterprise, generating enormous numbers of new jobs and raising living standards generally.</P>
    <P>The issues confronting us today, whether in terms of competitiveness, social cohesion or environmental sustainability, are no less complex and challenging and require a similar, collective response. In the past, social partnership has demonstrated a capacity for adapting and evolving and this can, and should, be drawn upon again in meeting current circumstances and concerns. Each agreement has to address the current con<Col N="1081" /> cerns of Government and the social partners. There are undoubtedly concerns to be met. However, the focus should be on meeting them and getting the right agreement rather than on the principle of an agreement in itself.</P>
    <P>The potential for, and the nature of a new agreement will be dependent on the next Government's programme, the views of the social partners as they evolve, the emerging NESC strategy for the period ahead and the report of the Public Service Benchmarking Body. The scope, duration and nature of any new agreement would be a matter for negotiation between Government and the social partners. However, this Government remains committed to the principle of a new social partnership agreement as the best way of ensuring the economic and social cohesion which is of fundamental importance to ensuring a prosperous, fair and sustainable society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my view that the process of social partnership is indispensable if we are to move forward and make progress in the first decade of this century? Does he further agree that the agenda for the social partners has changed dramatically since the mid-1980s, but that IBEC &ndash; the employers' group &ndash; has probably benefited more than any other group within the triangular framework of social partnership? This is the case regarding the framework of legal regulation within which they have to operate, the level of personal tax for high earners, corporation tax, capital gains tax and other areas, including employers' PRSI.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach further agree that while it is probable that a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; wage agreement at national level seems unlikely in light of statements by a number of key employers and trade unions, the agenda is one of consolidating the social model of this country rather than dealing with issues of employment or taxation? Does he further agree that the Government has a specific role in formulating the kind of agenda around which the trade unions and employers' groups in particular could come together to examine the factors which are driving up employers' costs or wages, depending on which way one looks at it? These factors would include the cost of housing, child care and transport. If the Government could bring to bear its executive and legislative capabilities to address these issues, some of the concerns expressed by the trade union leadership and employers could be assuaged. We need to refocus the agenda of social partnership as we prepare for an eighth agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept much of what the Deputy says. His fundamental point is that the times and circumstances of each agreement are different. The agenda of the social partners is certainly different. I have been honoured to have been involved in all of them and to have been central to them. Over the past 15 years I have negotiated four of them and implemented the fifth. Every time we come to the last six or nine <Col N="1082" /> months people air their discontent with aspects of the programmes where they have not worked out as per the agenda they set down. As good negotiators why should they not do that? Sometimes I do not appreciate the protests as they exclude the successful elements. In their protestations people sometimes forget how much has been achieved beyond their aspirations. We hear all the gripes but I suppose I should not be surprised at that.</P>
      <P>We have always managed to deal with different issues in past agreements. There are also major challenges. Some people are pessimistic but it should be possible to reach a new agreement in the end. The reality is that the social partners have all done well from the process. What is happening in their organisations and the European scene shows how successful the social partnership process has been. People argue that the partnership process is not the only reason for our achievements. That is true but it is the number one reason.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made the point that it is the job of Government to build a strategy to deal with this. I accept that. We are now into the second phase of what was the second ten-year strategy of NESC. It has to be in mark two of this decade's NESC strategy that we move forward. Models are being looked at, discussions are taking place and examinations are being made to see how we can do this. There will be a time to signal that publicly but work must be done to move through the programme first. I assure the House that we are working towards that. It was a ten-year strategy because I asked that the NESC strategy not be a three-year one. It was to look to the decade of 2000-2010 and set each agreement, as we did successfully through the 1990s, within that framework allowing for any positive or negative circumstances over the period. We are engaged in that work and will, I hope, move people to that position over the next period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comprehensive statement of Government policy by the Taoiseach. Has he communicated that to the Minister for Finance who seems to be hinting, or allowing it be hinted on his behalf without denial, that he would not mind if there was not a new national agreement? Does the Taoiseach not agree that the reason we have been economically successful is that there has been a political consensus, the second pillar of which has been social partnership, and that it is important that should continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would he also agree that the key criteria by which the aptness of a new agreement would be measured is the effect it has on competitiveness? This must be the key measure if we are to continue our economic success. Will he acknowledge that we have a price problem which has a knock-on effect on wages? Our inflation is among the highest in the European Union and has been for much of the life of this Government compared to the record of the previous Government. The question of competitiveness is a matter of con<Col N="1083" /> cern to employers and should be of concern to the Government. Will the Taoiseach agree that competitiveness is not just affected by prices and wages but also by productivity and flexibility? Will the Taoiseach tell us what he will do about the prices problem in this country? The price of houses affects people and leads to higher wage demands. The price of cars, because of high VRT, the price of petrol and the price of supermarket goods lead to the same. Will the Taoiseach accept that his Government has been a failure in respect of prices?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the recent comments of Brian Patterson, the chairman of the National Competitiveness Council, on competitiveness. He cautioned against throwing out the key reason for economic success which in the council's view was social partnership. It pointed out that the partnership demonstrated a capacity for adapting and evolving. This is the challenge. Competitiveness is a key element and is linked to productivity. It is also linked to the people generating the activities of the goods and services field. They also want remuneration compatible with what they believe they are justified in getting. In recent years we gained in competitiveness because, through a combination of fiscal and monetary policies, we were able to keep ourselves in a position where we remained competitive. Wage inflation has now moved up as has inflation although EU, OECD and ESRI reports say inflation will drop back.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputy Mitchell that a decade ago inflation was 1% but so was economic growth. While inflation needs to be watched and monitored, it is a fact that in an economy that is generating a great deal of activity some inflation is inevitable. It should be minimised as much as possible. When an economy has grown by 10%, as our economy has for a number of years, inflation is inevitable. That then drives wage inflation which is not good for economic activity so we must be careful. It links to the wage issue and that is part of the challenge of the next agreement. We must make sure that the predominant issues of competitiveness, economic growth, economic prosperity and the ability to generate enough revenue so that we can enhance our services remain the issues for us. We are in a good position to deal with these issues and have been dealing with them through the programmes over the past 15 years. It is always a challenge, but it is far easier now than it was in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of social partnership has evolved and developed so that we have a new institution that has grown out of social partnership, a centre for partnership. Will the Taoiseach indicate what role that new autonomous body will have in its present structure as distinct from its previous incarnations? It now has stronger autonomy in implementing or complementing some of <Col N="1084" /> the work of any social partnership agreement. Would the Taoiseach give his opinion as to the effectiveness of the present model of social partnership? The present agreement has spawned some 64 separate working groups and parties. In the light of the experience of the Taoiseach's Department and the many Departments whose officials have to provide staffing and representatives to those committees does the Taoiseach see this as the way to go or should we rethink that way of doing business within the structure of social partnership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the two issues. The first was the new role for NCCP. It has an enormous opportunity and I look forward to working to its agenda. It has many different priorities now but there is one important priority I would like to see developed. It has taken us some time in the social partnership model to bring the focus from central positions and overall structures down to enterprises. Health partnership groups are now being set up but they are only at the start of perhaps 15 years of partnership. There are many areas in which partnership needs to be developed at local level and people need to see the benefits for themselves. That is the role that partnerships can play and there are enormous opportunities in these areas. I hope that we have left behind the old adversarial days with managements sending out diktats, but we will know that we have when people on local committees are involved in projects such as these. I recently had the pleasure of seeing medics and what would have been considered years ago in the health service to be &ldquo;ancillary staff&rdquo; working together as joint stakeholders. It was interesting and rewarding to see this and, as time moves on, things should improve further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn also asked about the number of working groups. I would rather see more focus. It has worked well but it is very detailed. If we were to take more central themes we would probably gain more. I do not think there are too many issues that require a huge amount of effort and over a three-year period we would make more progress if we chose fewer of them. There are probably no more than ten really big issues that need to be dealt with. When there are too many and too much effort is invested, it has a bad effect on the system. The system, between the European agenda, legislative measures and so on, is liable to be pulled in too many ways. If we want efficiency in the system we will be better off concentrating on a small number of areas and using public service modernisation effectively. This cannot be done across 70 or 80 different projects. An agreement that focuses on some key issues is more likely to achieve a satisfactory result. This is what we did with the Programme for Economic and Social Progress: we concentrated on a small number of issues and it worked well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even if a person's income exceeds the guidelines a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances justify this.</P>
      <P>It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. The Deputy is no doubt aware that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as the carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy launched by the Government late last year. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to last year's extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. The Government's commitment to extending medical card coverage should be viewed in the broader <Col N="1086" /> context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society.</P>
    <P>A series of initiatives has been introduced to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations contained in the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>These initiatives include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency, providing clearer information about how and where to apply for medical cards and pro-actively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. During 2002, the Government's priorities for improving the health system and providing greater equity include the provision of 709 additional acute public hospital beds and 200 beds contracted from the private sector, addressing waiting times through a new treatment purchase fund and maintaining investment levels in the general programme to reduce waiting lists, commencing implementation of the new model of primary care, services for people with a disability and services for older people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his reply is what the late Winston Churchill would have termed a &ldquo;terminological inexactitude&rdquo; but what most people would call a much shorter three-letter word? Will the Minister confirm that the reality is this: that for males aged 55 and over, the death rate among poor people is something like 32 per thousand whereas for middle-income people it is 22 per thousand and for the richest group it is about 11 per thousand? In other words, poorer people die younger. Will the Minister confirm that a poor person living alone on &euro;138 per week does not qualify for a medical card? Will he also confirm that the number of people qualifying for medical cards has dropped from 37% during the term of the rainbow coalition to 29% now, even though the existing agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation allows for 40% of the population to be covered? Does the Minister agree that this apartheid, which he has deliberately extended into primary care, is one of the most outrageous pieces of misgovernment that we have seen for a very long time and that it is based on injustice and indifference to the plight of the poor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the latter part of the Deputy's questions. We know from research &ndash; indeed, the health strategy identifies this issue as an important one &ndash; that there is a greater degree of poor health among lower income groups. However, there are wider issues to be <Col N="1087" /> considered such as preventative health strategies, patterns of behaviour, diet, smoking, access to education and other facilities and so on. It is a much more complex story which has given rise to these research findings. These statistics are also world-wide phenomena. That is why my Department was one of the first to agree to the new national anti-poverty targets for health and health improvement for people in low income groups. That is included as a solid commitment within the health strategy and within broader Government policy. This is a more broadly effective way to deal with this fundamental issue.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, at the moment about 1,218,250 people are in receipt of a medical card, which is about 31.47% of the population. The obvious reason why the percentage has dropped from 37% is that over 370,000 extra jobs have been created and unemployment has come down from 11% in 1997 to 4% this year. Clearly, that has had an impact on medical card entitlement because the system is based on income thresholds. However, as I have pointed out, where people are suffering from particular conditions, income is not the determining factor. There are thousands of discretionary medical cards within the system, issued by chief executive officers to people who are above the income cut-off point but suffer from certain medical conditions. We did make a commitment in 1997 to give specific, special treatment to older people within our community&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>the position with regard to the pro vision of iodine tablets to the health boards; the number of such tablets currently held by each health board; if it is intended that these will be distributed to the public; the proposed manner of distribution; when the distribution will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>A recommendation was made as part of the review of the national nuclear emergency plan, which is co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise, that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as an effective counter measure. I accepted this recommendation and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, acting on behalf of my Department, notified the European Commission on 19 October 2001 of an invitation to tender for the supply of iodide or iodate tablets.</P>
      <P>The procedures laid down under Directive 93/36/EEC, which allow for an accelerated tendering process for the award of public supply contracts, were followed to enable purchase of stocks at the earliest opportunity. A contract for the supply of potassium iodate tablets was awarded to Kelkin limited in Dublin 12 on 21 December 2001. The statutory instrument requiring medicines to have product authorisations was amended to facilitate the placement on the market of these tablets without authorisation. The first consignment of 1.5 million tablets was delivered last week and final deliveries from Kelkin are expected by the end of May.</P>
      <P>The Government task force on emergency planning, chaired by the Minister for Defence, has decided to distribute tablets directly to each household through the postal system. As it is necessary to package and label each carton of tablets so it can be distributed safely and securely by post, a further tendering process was necessary for the provision of a mail fulfilment service to perform this function adequately. The ERHA, following the appropriate tendering process under EU legislation, awarded a contract to DC Kavanagh limited in Dublin 8 and SonoPress Ireland limited in Swords business park for the fulfilment of the tablet cartons into purpose designed envelopes. It is envisaged that fulfilment will be completed within ten days of the final delivery of tablets from Kelkin. My Department is liaising with An Post to make the necessary contractual arrangements to ensure the secure delivery of a carton of tablets to each household as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised in relation to stocks which were distributed to health boards in 1991. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has 720,000 tablets which were usable when they were tested 16 months ago. The South-Eastern Health Board has 360,000 tablets which were usable when they were tested in 2000. The North-Eastern Health Board has 180,000 tablets which were usable when they were tested in 1999. The North-Western Health Board has 3,000 untested tablets. The Mid-Western Health Board has 300,000 untested <Col N="1091" /> tablets. The Midland Health Board, the Western Health Board and the Southern Health Board have no supplies of iodine tablets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how much canvassing the Minister has been doing and perhaps my experience is related to the fact that I am canvassing in County Wicklow, on the east coast, but I am often asked on doorsteps when iodine tablets will arrive. The Minister had to revise promises and commitments that were made in relation to the availability and possible usage of iodine tablets following the events of 11 September, which raised great alarm across the country. Does he accept that it is difficult for people to understand why we are still waiting for supplies of iodine tablets in mid-April, given that the contract was signed last December and that newspapers reported in February, based on information from the Department of Health and Children, that iodine tablets would be available to households by March as part of the upgrading of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents? It is inexplicable that we must wait for another month or two before tablets are distributed to households. Is it intended to begin distribution before the election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The date of the election has no bearing on the distribution of iodine tablets. We have to fulfil the contracts signed as part of the tendering process, not only for the manufacture of tablets but also the contract for the mail fulfilment order. As I said, the tender process for the packaging of tablets into cartons amenable to posting them to households will take some time. A decision has been taken to distribute within a set period of time to facilitate a strong advance public advertising programme. When the tablets are about to be delivered, we will be anxious to ensure that people are aware of suitable methods of storing them and that necessary precautions are taken. A sufficient number of tablets have been ordered and 1.5 million have already arrived in the country. We are keen to store a reserve of tablets other than those to be distributed directly to households.</P>

      <P>The Government's health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, is the most comprehensive health sector strategy in the history of the State. It represents a whole system approach to the issue of health in Ireland and goes beyond the traditional concept of health services. It accepts that although much has been achieved, more remains to be done. The strategy has a wide-ranging agenda encompassing matters such as cross-sectoral working to influence the wider determinants of health and the development of specific services. It also encompasses a wide-ranging and ambitious agenda for change.</P>
      <P>A number of items have been prioritised this year. The Government showed its commitment to the health strategy through the funding provided in this year's budget, which amounted to &euro;209 million revenue and &euro;40 million under capital expenditure, including new initiatives and development of certain existing services described in the strategy. In addition to the budget package, a further &euro;161 million is available in 2002 for the development of existing services under the strategy.</P>
      <P>One of the key strengths of the health strategy is the inclusion of a detailed action plan and a monitoring and evaluation framework. The mechanisms and structures provided for in the framework are essential if we are to meet the deadlines set out in the action plan. The first of these structures is already in place. The strategy's goals and objectives have been embedded into the Department's business plan to ensure that the Government's commitments are given appropriate priority in the context of a wide-ranging brief. The 2002 service plans of health boards reflect the many actions which must be advanced at health board level in the next year. The inclusion of a detailed action plan has helped to focus the key actors on the priorities of the strategy and has clarified responsibility for implementation. I am happy to provide the Deputy with a list of the specific actions which have progressed this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>In terms of implementation structures, the departmental health strategy implementation team is in place. A vacancy at assistant secretary level has been filled in recent weeks and the primary care task force has been established. Nominations for the steering group are currently being <Col N="1093" /> sought and Professor Ivan Perry of University College Cork has agreed to chair the group. A team to manage the treatment purchase fund has been established, which is interdisciplinary and led by independent consultant, Ms Maureen Lynott, who has been appointed as project director. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been established and Ms Olive Braiden has been appointed as chairperson. The national committee on breastfeeding has been appointed and will be chaired by Miriam Wiley of the ESRI. The Health Boards Executive was established on 15 February.</P>
    <P>The following documents have been published: The primary care document, &ldquo;Primary Care: A New Direction&rdquo; in November 2001; the consultation document, &ldquo;Your Views About Health&rdquo; in January 2002, and &ldquo;Traveller Health &ndash; A National Strategy 2002-2005&rdquo; in January 2002. The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill has been signed <Col N="1094" /> into law, and scheduling of the implementation process, including the making of commencement orders and regulations is under consideration. Progress is also being made on the following key actions &ndash; finalisation of the national environmental health action plan; review of medicines legislation; licensing of alternative medicines; information and education campaign on the strategy's goals and objectives; commissioning of over 700 additional acute hospital beds; preparation of an action plan for people management; restructuring of the Department of Health and Children and audit of functions and structures in the health system.</P>
    <P>The health strategy published in November is an ambitious plan and its implementation will require sustained effort over the next seven to ten years. There will be challenges for everyone working in the system along the way. I am very pleased with the progress that has been made to date.</P>

            <entry>The Secretary General of the Department wrote to all relevant Government Departmental Secretary Generals in November 2001 following the launch of the Health Strategy. This letter drew their attention to specific initiatives in which it is envisaged other Departments would play a significant or lead role; and also referring specifically to actions that will require co-ordination between more than one Department. This included reference to the need to embed an explicit commitment to sustaining and improving health status in departmental strategies and business plans.</entry>

The Department has been advised, by the ERHA and the Health Boards that 98 of these beds have been commissioned, that an additional 23 beds will come on stream by the end of April 2002, with a further 49 beds by the end of May 2002.

We have substantially increased funding again this year to the ERHA in respect of the acute hospital sector. I understand that talks are ongoing between the major voluntary hospitals in the ERHA region and the authority, and that there will be tripartite talks between these two parties and the Department to resolve issues and difficulties that have arisen. There should be no mistake about health funding which has increased by 120% over the past four years.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to the general mix of beds which are needed for the care of older people, for example, assessment and rehabilitation, respite, extended care, elderly mentally infirm and convalescent. The most up-to-date statistics in this regard were collated in July 2001 and the relevant figures are set out in the schedule circulated with this reply. Corresponding figures for 1997 are not readily available, but are being collated. It is not, therefore, possible to accurately state the overall bed numbers but we can say that since 1997 some 600 extra beds have been put in place. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area alone, five new community nursing units in Meath, Dalkey, Lusk, north Dublin and south Dublin, have been opened since 1998, with a total of 261 beds. However, where increases occurred in other parts of the country, they would not have been as large. Not all new facilities produced an increase in bed capacity, as in some instances, new units were simply replacing old unsatisfactory accommodation which often dated back to the workhouse days. The recently published health strategy proposes the provision of 800 additional extended care and community nursing unit places per annum over the next seven years, including provision for people with dementia.</P>

      <P>The Minister will understand my surprise that he does not have the information I requested. Would he agree that the elderly infirm are being treated disgracefully in this State; that the Government has no policy on this issue; that families are forced to live in misery and poverty to make up the balance between nursing home subvention and pension payments and the <Col N="1101" /> increasing cost of nursing homes in order to have a loved one cared for in a nursing home; that families are being put under extreme pressure and, as a consequence, stress is placed on the elderly themselves, who know what their families are going through and are aware that their condition is creating problems for them? Does he agree that the State is not making available services in general hospitals for elderly people who need continuing care which in many instances forces distantly related families to provide funding which is taken out of small incomes intended for day-to-day living? Does he agree that it is unfair that the elderly in nursing homes are forced to sell their homes? I know a person of 71 who is being forced to sell her cottage for £30,000 to pay the balance of what is required in the nursing home, meaning that she has no home to return to. Does the Minister agree that that is unfair and that the elderly are being treated disgracefully under the Government's stewardship?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy because more money has been put into the elderly services than ever before. The figure was £10 million in 1997 when we came into Government but it is now about &euro;100 million. We have also increased subvention and funding for other sectors, such as pensions which have increased by over 30%.</P>
      <P>In the general hospitals, the winter initiative helped in that area. As I stated, many new nursing homes are being built throughout the country&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 11,000 public nursing home beds now and the private sector is providing over 12,000. Many more private sector beds are coming on stream and these are used by health boards in certain cases. Under the health strategy, more places will be provided in the coming years. Good progress has been made in this area in the past five years. Our main aim is to keep people at home and to strengthen community care whenever possible. Under the national development plan, we put in £2 billion, half of which will go into community care, something that has not happened before. We also want to establish good services on the ground, such as physiotherapy, occupational and speech therapy, home-help and carers. The allocation for carers alone has increased fivefold since the Government took up office. A great deal is being done in regard to care of the elderly both in the community and in nursing units.</P>

      <Quest>when a lung transplant unit will be established here.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12454/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland and to ensure that the programme, when introduced, will be in a position to match the highest international standards in lung transplantation.</P>
      <P>The Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. The provision of a lung transplant unit at the hospital forms part of a major capital development approved for the hospital. To progress this project an expert consultative group, chaired by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, was established to advise my Department on various issues associated with the development of the programme. The report of the consultative group has been received and is being progressed as a priority by my Department in conjunction with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital. The report was the subject of a recent and very positive discussion with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable preparatory work has been completed by the hospital in relation to the commencement of this project. Key issues addressed include governance, management and quality assurance criteria, including external peer review of the proposal. The hospital is finalising an assessment of the financial requirement associ<Col N="1103" /> ated with the introduction of the programme. On receipt of this information and subject to approval by my Department, I am advised that the hospital proposes to commence lung transplantation towards the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>In terms of progressing the establishment of the programme, the Deputy will be pleased that a number of key clinical appointments have been made at the Mater Hospital, including the appointment of a consultant surgeon and a consultant physician.</P>
    <P>Pending the establishment of the programme in Ireland, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients requiring lung or heart and lung transplant. To date, 19 patients from this country have received transplants at the Freeman Hospital under the agreement. This contract will continue while the necessary arrangements are being progressed in terms of establishing the programme in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that lungs donated in Ireland have been retrieved by the medical team at Newcastle and have helped to facilitate this additional transplant work at Newcastle for the benefit of Irish patients. I assure the Deputy that the establishment of the Irish programme will continue to be progressed as a priority by me and my Department in conjunction with the ERHA and the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>In reverence to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will be lenient on the Minister. Many people are waiting to be called for heart and lung transplants outside the State. Does the Minister expect that transplants will be performed in Ireland by the end of this year? How many people are waiting for such operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures. Approximately 124 people were referred for assessment but approximately 20 are still waiting. I will forward the figures to the Deputy. I had them with me last weekend when I met the Cystic Fibrosis Association. We are awaiting specific details from the Mater Hospital. There will be a state-of-the-art heart and lung transplant unit in the new Mater Hospital which is under construction. It is included in the specification but we cannot wait until that is completed. We are looking for an interim solution using the existing facilities at the hospital and its administrators will come back to us with their requirements. Subject to that, I am advised we could begin the process by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key aim is to ensure everything is done in accordance with international best practice and we get off to a good start in terms of the success of the programme. I am acutely aware that many people are on a waiting list and time is against them. The agreement with the Freeman Hospital at Newcastle has been very good for Ireland because it has provided stability and continuity in the programme of transplantation. Until then it <Col N="1104" /> was done on a clinician to clinician basis. We are prioritising this service and I am hopeful the programme will be commenced by the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will keep the pressure on because a commitment was given on this by his party in its programme for Government. We are five years down the road but I will be the first to welcome the transplantation programme if it commences by the end of the year. Many young and middle-aged people are waiting for such operations and I agree we are lucky there is an agreement with the Freeman Hospital. However, I would like this surgery to be undertaken in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The people of Waterford were mortified by the behaviour of a small group towards the Taoiseach when he visited the city a number of weeks ago in regard to this issue. The vast majority of the city's population take a proper and dignified approach to the matter, particularly the group that has been campaigning vigorously in this regard. We were impressed by the Minister's approach in regard to a radiotherapy unit for Waterford when we met him some time ago. If he is returned to Government in his current capacity, will he give us a commitment that the <Col N="1105" /> unit will be provided? Everyone in Waterford is seeking a commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments regarding a potential return to the House. I acknowledge and appreciate his comments in regard to the Taoiseach's visit to Waterford. I accept totally that the vast majority of people would not endorse the actions of a few. Our fundamental structures for radiotherapy services are poor for historical reasons. When the first National Cancer Forum was established in 1996 it conducted a review of services nationwide and recommended the beefing up of two radiotherapy centres in Dublin and Cork to attain state-of-the-art clinical excellence. It also mentioned Galway as a third possibility. That is the base from which the Department has been working over recent years.</P>
      <P>I met a number of radiotherapists and consultants in this field who argued cogently that radiotherapy did not receive adequate consideration in the first cancer strategy and forum and felt it needed to be examined again. That is why I set up the expert group chaired by Donal Hollywood. The key issue was whether there was enough radiotherapy coverage for patients throughout the country. It is because radiotherapy is needed in a majority of cases and up to 60% of cancer patients require it at some stage that I established the expert group. Until then, there was no discussion of locating centres. That group is working well and I met the chairman recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I know from contacts I have had with the Minister that he is well aware of this issue. I have also had contacts with the Taoiseach on it. I also know the Minister is well aware of this issue from the meetings he has had not only with Members from Waterford but also with those from the south-east. This is not just a Waterford issue. It is a south-east one.</P>
      <P>We must recognise the reality of the suffering people endure in travelling to and from Dublin five days a week. Not everyone can stay in Dublin. This travel requirement is an extreme hardship imposed on these people.</P>
      <P>It does not make sense to have two strands of cancer treatment &ndash; surgery and chemotherapy &ndash; and not have a third strand of radiotherapy. One of the arguments against this is that the model being examined is a unit for every million people. The United Kingdom model has been examined, but it is a much more densely populated country than Ireland. We should examine other countries, for example, Holland, where I understand the model used is one to 500,000 people. There are 440,000 people in the south-east of this country, so we are very close to that number. Is there any way that model could be examined and for us to proceed along those lines? It would bring about the position we are trying to achieve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like the Minister to consider other countries of the world with a lower population density than those cited. British Columbia has such a low density and it has radiotherapy units available to its people. Given the reasons we have outlined &ndash; the hardship involved, the pain and suffering, the awful transport system and roads between the south-east and Dublin &ndash; can the Minister give a commitment that the unit will be provided? It will be a political decision. We believe the expert group will favour the three centres the Minister named. We need a commitment that Waterford will receive such a unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the chairman of the expert committee to take on board the issues of access, inconvenience, hardship and upset caused to patients who must travel to Dublin and to examine the regions. I know the South-Eastern Health Board has met the expert group regarding the claim of Waterford, as has the Mid-Western Health Board regarding the claim of Limerick, and the North-Western Health Board has made its demand for facilities. We are committed to providing radiotherapy services in the regions.</P>
      <P>We must be careful about raising expectations too high because whatever emerges from the expert group will be implemented on a phased basis. Dublin and Cork formed the original aim of the cancer forum. Much but not all of what it recommended was achieved and the expert group is examining that. A centre for Galway was announced or sanctioned in 1998, if I am not mistaken. It is still a hole in the ground because a new hospital is being built there.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest problems is putting the human resources in place to staff and maintain a viable unit. These are practical issues which are being lost&mdash;</P>

My predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, sanctioned a radiotherapy centre for Galway.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme. This programme provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The World Health Organisation has indicated that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism and that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of the vaccine. The WHO strongly endorses the use of the MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy.</P>
      <P>The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published research does not support a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The institutions include the Medical Research Council expert committee in the United Kingdom, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA and the American Academy of Paediatrics. Most recently, the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years during which the vaccine was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The MMR vaccine is in use worldwide. Most countries implement a two dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very success<Col N="1108" /> ful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The primary concern of the Department concerning immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The Irish Medicines Board and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland support the use of MMR on the grounds that it has been demonstrated to be a very safe and effective vaccine. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies, including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on childhood immunisation, published in July 2001, concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine.</P>
    <P>To reassure the public about the safety of the MMR vaccine and to address the negative media coverage on this issue which adds to the confusion of parents in deciding whether to vaccinate their children, I recently launched a document entitled, Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine Discussion Pack &ndash; an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the department of public health in the Southern Health Board. It was published by the health boards executive on behalf of the health boards. It sets out the facts on the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence on MMR, and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The pack addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism, the safety and side-effects of the vaccine, combined versus single doses and contra-indications to the vaccine.</P>
    <P>The national uptake rate for MMR in 2001 was 73%. This falls considerably short of the national target of 95% which is required to provide population immunity. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates because of the risk of children who have not been immunised contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned.</P>
    <P>In 2001 a national immunisation steering committee was established by the health board chief executive officers to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes, including the identification of issues that were hampering the achievement of uptake targets. On 22 April 2002 I launched the report of the steering committee. This is the first <Col N="1109" /> step towards improving immunisation uptake and enhancing and developing the key systems which underpin the immunisation programmes. A group under the auspices of the health boards executive is examining the report with a view to drawing up a detailed implementation plan.</P>
    <P>I urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contra-indications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points the Minister made and they are important. Does he not accept that the message has not got through, that many parents are deciding not to avail of the option of the MMR vaccine because of fears about side effects, and that he has a responsibility to reassure them and ensure full information is provided, especially about the dangers of measles? I am sure he is aware of the serious situation which has developed in the east. The most recent figures I have concerning the low uptake in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area are 68%. Does the Minister not accept that there is an issue of reassurance in putting across the message he enunciated and of ensuring a proper relationship between general practitioners and health boards, some of which have got their act together in the primary care area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken every public occasion to endorse the use of the MMR vaccine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been reported by every newspaper on the issue. Some of the coverage has been extensive and some not. We asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre to produce a document, which I launched recently, entitled, Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine Discussion Pack. It is a good discussion pack for parents and the public and there is a more substantive booklet of notes for general practitioners which will enable a good interaction to take place between GPs and parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there is concern about the issue. There is no question about that. That is why we decided to go the road of the discussion pack to try to allay the concerns, but more importantly to highlight the dangers of measles, mumps and rubella. Apart from the MMR issue, a certain complacency exists because measles has not been experienced by the mass of the population compared to the 1970s when an average of seven people a year died from it. The dangers of a measles epidemic has not fully been appreciated, which is in stark contrast to the uptake of the <Col N="1110" /> meningitis C vaccine, because parents were aware of the potential ravages it could visit on their children. A steering committee has been set up to address this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, notwithstanding what he has said and the evidence he quotes, there is a significant and growing minority who are concerned about the evidence? Would it help if there was a smart card for each child who is vaccinated which generated a computer record of his or her vaccination history which in turn could feed into a national database? This might be a way of communicating with people and assuring them that the information they require is available to them because they would retain the smart card themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a proper database is the way forward. In fact, we are working towards it in terms of the new PPN number, as it is called, where every person in the country will have a number for access to the public services. The provision of the necessary investment in information technology in general practices across the country will be a further key to making that a reality. Health information is one area where there is currently a deficiency, and while we have made much progress in terms of the HIPE data and so on from acute hospitals and other various databases there is, nonetheless, a clear need for a far more comprehensive set of databases to emerge and the new health information strategy will underpin that.</P>
      <P>I accept the basic point that if we had a number that individually identified patients it would significantly aid a programme of vaccination and immunisation. Last week I launched the report of a new group that I established, the national immunisation steering committee, which has specific recommendations in regard to the MMR. Further proactive campaigns on the issue will be seen in the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a particularly low uptake of MMR in disadvantaged urban areas? Does he accept that there is now a problem in regard to the number of family doctors in these areas, which has exacerbated the situation? The Minister himself has been responsible for attracting doctors into better-off areas due to the over-70s scheme. Will he state how he intends to deal with this dilemma?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The investment in primary care is the way forward in terms of improving the lives of general practitioners and that is why we have invested substantially this year in the general practice co-operatives. An extra &euro;10 million has <Col N="1111" /> been allocated for the development of general practice co-operatives, which will be of benefit to disadvantaged urban areas as well as other parts of the country. I acknowledge that GPs in such areas have an enormous work burden, which has built up over recent years &ndash; it did not just happen this year, or last year for that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not making it worse. All doctors I spoke to after the introduction of the GP co-operative, including in rural areas, spoke of the key dividend as being an improvement in their quality of life. I am convinced that is one way forward in reducing the burden on GPs. We also need to increase the intake into medical colleges in terms of future needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The general practitioners and the health board in Galway got off the mark very quickly in terms of containing that particular outbreak.

        <i>(Mayo)</i> asked the Minister for Health and Children if he has ascertained from the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board the situation regarding the psychiatric records which have gone missing in relation to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board has confirmed to me that certain medical records belonging to a person who received treatment at St. Conal's <Col N="1112" /> Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny in late 1996 cannot be located.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's deep concern that these records are missing. It is a matter of the utmost public importance that all of the information in relation to this case be made available to the courts and to the tribunal recently established by this House. I would like to assure the Deputy that everything possible is being done, both by the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board and by my Department to ascertain the circumstances surrounding this matter.</P>
      <P>A senior officer of the North-Western Health Board commenced work on a report into the missing medical notes a number of days ago. His interim report was examined by health board management this morning. On 28 March 2002, the board received a request from the legal representatives of a person for a copy of her hospital notes. The staff of the medical records department at the acute admissions unit, Letterkenny General Hospital, where these notes would normally be stored, were unable to find all of her records. An extensive search has been conducted over the past number of days, including a search of the medical records department, the archives department, the offices and clinic rooms of the clinicians, therapists, nursing staff and clerical staff involved in the mental health services. When the medical records officer discovered that the notes were missing, she immediately traced all other notes belonging to members of the person's extended family and I understand that these have been secured. However, despite this extensive search a part of the medical record concerned is still missing.</P>
      <P>Missing from the medical records are the in-patient records covering a period from 14 December 1996 to 7 February 1997 during which time the person was a patient in the acute admissions unit at Letterkenny General Hospital. Other records relating to the person have not gone missing. These include notes recorded on her admissions and contacts with Letterkenny General Hospital and all notes relating to her out-patient attendances as well as reports prepared for the court in 1997 by treating clinicians, therapists and nursing staff. Out-patient records are normally held in a separate location to in-patient records. The notes which are missing would normally be stored in the medical records department at the acute admissions unit, Letterkenny General Hospital. The medical records department is supervised during normal office hours by the medical records officer. The office is locked outside of office hours, but can be accessed by members of staff who have a pass key. For a variety of reasons, relating to the treatment of patients and report writing, a substantial number of staff including medical, nursing and others have authority to use a pass key and access the medical records department as part of the normal working of the unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no tracer record of the notes. The notes would have been due to be transferred to <Col N="1113" /> an archive facility in September 2000. A detailed record of all charts that have been moved from the main medical records department to the archive facility is maintained. However, there is no record of the notes having been passed on for archiving. Given the nature of the services provided, it is not unusual for records to be removed from the medical records department for considerable periods of time during patient treatment or for the purpose of report writing. Occasionally there can be delays in locating medical record files, but there is no previous history of a file from the mental health medical records department remaining untraced.</P>
    <P>While the chief executive officer is satisfied that staff have conducted a thorough search, he has assigned a second, fresh team to conduct a further complete search. It seems most unlikely in the circumstances that the missing notes will be located, which is unprecedented for the mental health service. The chief executive officer has emphasised that should the present search prove inconclusive, he will ask the appropriate authorities to investigate the matter further. He is conscious of the upset this is likely to cause the parties involved and wants to assure them that he will make every effort to bring about a speedy conclusion. In view of the seriousness of this matter, I have requested the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to independently investigate the circumstances surrounding the missing medical notes as a matter of urgency. If the outcome of these inquiries is unsatisfactory, I will have no hesitation in appointing an independent investigator of high standing to carry out a full and detailed inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding this disturbing matter.</P>
    <P>I add to the sentiments expressed by the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board and voice my personal regret at the hurt and inconvenience this must cause the person concerned and the extended family. I assure them of my personal commitment to ensuring that this matter is thoroughly investigated.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister accept that the individual in question is Róisín McConnell, one of those who were totally innocent and wrongly accused? She was emotionally destroyed due to the manner in which the Garda arrested her and conducted its inquiries relating to the McBrearty affair and the murder of Richie Barron? This is a disgrace. Hers is the only missing file and it is not a coincidence. The whole saga stinks and is yet another twist in the tangled story of the McBrearty affair and alleged Garda misconduct in Donegal. Were, or are, any relatives of gardaí currently under investigation by the Carty team or who are likely to be called before the Morris team working at the hospital or did any of them have access to the files?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have access to that information today. I share the Deputy's deep concern about this issue and I have articulated that in my <Col N="1114" /> comprehensive reply. I have asked the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to independently examine this matter because the mental health service and I, as Minister, are very anxious that records are properly and efficiently kept in the interests of patient care. Those are fundamental prerequisites in terms of record keeping for all patients and we view this matter with very deep concern. That is why the chief executive officer of the health board has assigned his own team to trawl the records again and likewise has brought in a fresh team. I have said from the moment we received news of this that I asked the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to investigate the matter independently. At this time I am not aware of what people have access to the hospital, but that will come to light in due course.</P>

        <b>: </b>I thank the Minister for his reply and ask him to investigate this aspect of the matter. I do not want to point the finger of blame at anybody, but I am aware that relatives of gardaí who were investigated and interrogated by the Carty team are working in the hospital.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the period from 14 December to February is the vital time in the immediate aftermath of the arrests of Róisín McConnell, Mark McConnell, Frank McBrearty junior and Frank McBrearty senior, which led to the nervous breakdown of Róisín McConnell, her subsequent trauma and her very acute psychiatric illness? She suffered as a result of being mishandled and dealt with in a most inhuman fashion while in custody at Letterkenny Garda station. Does the Minister accept that it is more than a coincidence that of all the files, it is those relating to this crucial period in the immediate aftermath of her arrest, interrogation and maltreatment which are missing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That period is of crucial importance, though I am not intimate with all the details on the justice side in terms of the precise sequence of events. Obviously, it is very disquieting that records covering the period from 14 December 1996 to 7 February 1997 are missing as that is the exact time the person concerned was a patient in the acute admissions unit of the hospital. It is a crucial period in that person's life and in terms of what happened subsequently. The evidence in the files is obviously very important and those notes would be very important to the person and to any case she is taking in relation to other issues. The reports that are still on file relate to her admission and contacts with Letterkenny General Hospital and all notes relating to her outpatient attendance, as well as reports prepared for the court in 1997 by the treating clinicians, therapists and nursing staff, are still there.</P>

        <b>: </b>In relation to the inquiries the Minister and the chief executive officer have instituted, what deadline has been set by which it shall be established one way or the other whether <Col N="1115" /> the notes can be located or retrieved? In his first reply, the Minister mentioned he would have no hesitation in referring the matter to the appropriate authorities. I presume by &ldquo;appropriate authorities&rdquo; he means the Garda. If the matter is referred to the Garda, the investigations should be carried out by gardaí from outside the Letterkenny division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive officer has emphasised that should the search prove inconclusive he, as the person with statutory responsibility for what happens in the health board, will ask the appropriate authorities to investigate the matter. I accept the Deputy's point, which is fair, and I will convey that back. More importantly, I have asked the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to investigate the circumstances surrounding the missing medical notes as a matter of urgency. I expect the inspector to come back to me within a matter of days on that and if I am not satisfied I will have no hesitation in appointing an independent investigator of high standing to carry out a full and detailed inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding this disturbing matter.

      <P>As I have only one minute left, the final point I make is to caution against the capping of awards in personal injury cases. That should not be treated in an arbitrary or less than fulsome manner as to do so would have huge consequences. We introduce such caps at our peril and I am not sure they would be in the public interest. I would rather see reform of the law relating to compensation for personal injuries. Bogus claims will have to be tackled and I would like to see the introduction of a criminal offence for those parties who engage in the perpetration of bogus or fraudulent claims on the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>The courts system should be technologically fully up to date. A statutory scheme should be introduced for structured settlements in very serious cases where there are serious injuries. I would like to see the empowering of the presidents of the various courts to setting down guidelines because the inconsistency or lottery is much more urgent than the actual quantum involved. New procedural rules should be prescribed for civil litigation to encourage early settlement because the costs involved are generated by the delays. The process needs to be speeded up which is why the setting up of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is urgently required. I do not think the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, or his colleagues have the political will to do this. This should be done in cases where liability is not an issue and where there can be an independent determination of compensation. It should also be done on a phased basis. Initially the board when set up should deal with motor accident claims. There is no reason this should be delayed.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the report, it indicates proof, if proof were needed, that the Government has wasted five years on undertaking important initiatives. It is now hiding behind the report which, with the greatest respect to all involved, does not come up with anything terribly new, even though it requires absolute evidence of many things that were in the public arena by way of suspicion, principally that drivers, particularly young drivers under the age of 30, have been fleeced by insurance companies over the years with no justification.</P>

      <P>The report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board deserves to be one of those publications that, in their relevant field, should usher in thoroughgoing and radical change. In the field of general Irish economic policy, for example, Ken Whitaker's Economic Development is today seen as precisely such a <Col N="1117" /> document. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say of the Dowling report that it should lead to a radical reshaping of motor insurance. Whether it will is another issue because, in the end, that depends on the Government. It depends on the extent to which the Government adopts fully and implements comprehensively the programme prescribed in the report.</P>
      <P>The portents are not good. Never in the history of the State has a Government done so little to address the worsening insurance crisis. Now, at literally the 12th hour, the Minister concerned draws on all the resources of spin and presentation to somehow associate himself with the Dowling report and identify himself with the analysis and findings which he spent five years resisting. Question Time after Question Time, as Deputy Flanagan will bear out, he rhymed off the same answers as follows. Because of the high incidence of accidents and claims among young drivers nothing could be done. That was the standard reply. The Dowling report shows the word processor got it wrong. As recently as today in the Shelbourne Hotel, 14 major business associations announced the formation of an alliance &ldquo;to tackle once and for all the continuing crisis in the insurance industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>While the Dowling report is confined to a specific area of the insurance business, it raises a more general question. Why should we take it that the profiteering that characterises the motor business is confined to that line of business? Frankly it stretches credulity to accept or assume that the creaming by vested interests referred to in the report, the waste, inefficiency and profiteering that is highlighted in the case of motor insurance, is unique to that class of insurance. The experiences of public undertakings and private firms in relation to employer and public liability suggest that almost the entire industry requires to be investigated to establish whether the public expenditure allocations and the hard earned incomes of such services and businesses goes towards excessive and always rising premiums. That was certainly the view this morning in the Shelbourne Hotel of the 14 business associations that came together. All of them are extremely concerned about the escalating cost of insurance premiums wider than motor insurance, including employers' liability, the collapse of Independent Insurance Company Limited, with which we dealt previously, the impact feeding through into the economy of 11 September, the inability to get reinsurers from Britain and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many businesses, not just small business, whicih feel this is a serious impediment to their continuing in business in some cases and to the expansion of employment in other cases. They do not see any sign of that improving. They judge that from the performance in recent years these issues have not been addressed. We should ask why we think the exploitation highlighted in the Dowling report stops with this type of underwriting and does not extend to the life and savings businesses, for example. There is every possibility <Col N="1118" /> the savings schemes and life policies are equally about living high off the hog at the expense of savers, short changing them, cheating and mis-selling.</P>
    <P>It is claimed by the Government that the new, single financial services regulator will have the powers, resources and statutory duty to effectively regulate the insurance industry, to clean out the Augean stable so to speak. The Minister who for five years had responsibility for policy in this area did nothing and now claims ownership of the advisory board's report. After five years of inaction, as Deputy Flanagan said, he has announced an action programme, on the eve of his leaving office. There has been a referral to the Competition Authority and the Equality Authority. There are to be new disclosure requirements. A high level implementation group is to be established to rapidly implement the recommendations of the MIAB report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan raised a good point. Surely there must have been some recommendations among the 61 which the Minister could have proceeded to implement. Surely the Department and he long had sight of the way the Dowling report was going. He received a couple of interim reports and he had been studying the issue. He knew the way Ms Dowling was thinking. He knew about the claims of allegations of obstruction against the industry. He must have been aware of some of the recommendations and findings that would be made, yet rather than take action he chose to set up a committee. It would have been more convincing if the group had been buttressed by the implementation of at least some of the findings.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to refer recommendations to the Equality Authority and the Competition Authority. We might say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; but for the fact that we are aware of the Minister's record, that is, one of stalling on the implementation of the McAuley report's recommendation in respect of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, of attempted suppression of the interim report of the MIAB, dragged out under the Freedom of Information Act, and of procrastination in regard to the final report of the advisory board. The Minister's inaction has not been confined to the area of motor insurance. In the fields of employer and public liability the Minister has been equally inactive.</P>
    <P>In a private Members' debate on the insurance crisis, initiated in this House by the Labour Party in February this year, Deputies from all sides of the House, on the basis of representations made to them, conveyed the depth and extent of the crisis. The Labour Party motion called on the Tanáiste to provide funding for the Equality Authority to carry out a statutory inquiry into widespread and repeated allegations of discrimination by the motor insurance industry against young drivers on the basis of age and gender.</P>
    <P>On 29 March, 2001, I set out this proposal in a letter to the chief executive of the Equality Authority. This demand, made no more than a couple <Col N="1119" /> of months ago, was rejected by the Government. Now, two months on, the Minister announces there is to be such a referral. How is that consistent? The Labour Party motion also called for a thorough investigation by the Competition Authority into the general insurance market. Again, the motion was rejected by the Government. Now, two months later on the eve of an election, the Minister announces such an investigation will take place, but only into motor insurance. The motion also called on the Government to develop alternative dispute resolution in the insurance area as well as the implementation of case management by the courts. Now, we learn yet again of the imminent arrival of the personal injuries board.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the language used by the Minister in his script on this issue. It is not fair to Members on this side of the House, that the Minister of State, as a democratic and long serving Member of this House, should avoid all questions on this issue and simply rhyme off the mantra from the word processor every time. This House deserves an answer on the question of the personal injuries tribunal. We have asked the Minister, on several occasions, why a tribunal recommended by McAuley in May 1997 has not been implemented five years later. There may be a good reason it has not been implemented; there may be obstruction to it from the legal profession and so on. Five years is a long time to permit obstruction. I do not know if Deputy Flanagan noted the language used by the Minister in his script which states:</P>
    <P>With the personal injuries assessment board report nearing completion [another report nearing completion] a speedy Government response in due course to what will emerge, including taking a strong stance on any hostile reactions..</P>
    <P>That is not written like that for no reason. There is no personal injuries assessment board, we have a report nearing completion. I am sure the Minister of State will be preoccupied with other things around Ahascragh and Loughrea besides the completion of this report. The Minister said the Government will take &ldquo;a speedy Government response in due course to what will emerge including taking a strong stance on any hostile reactions&rdquo;. That is an amazing statement when the entire industry and everybody concerned about this issue has been led to believe the personal injuries assessment board is up and running. It now turns out that somebody is doing a report on it. It is not completed. I know the Minister of State has an optimistic outlook on life but giving a commitment to do something next October or December demonstrates great confidence that he will be in the same position after the election. I do not understand this and the House is entitled to a response in this regard.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dan McAuley brought forward this proposal five years ago and here we are, nothing <Col N="1120" /> done. We know the contribution the myriad of low awards makes to the cost of insurance. Costs, in some individual cases, are higher than the awards. The notion here was that where liability was uncontested this board could deal with it by rote, more speedily, less expensively and out of the court system.</P>

      <P>In and out. There may be an explanation for this although I cannot conceive of it. We have not heard it and we are entitled to know.</P>
      <P>For at least the last three years, there has been a growing focus on the problem in respect of the industry's treatment of customers, whether motorists, businesses, public services or households. The stream of complaints and anecdotes, studies and recommendations, representations and surveys has been continuous. The volume of evidence generated by this, if brought together, would fill a large warehouse. In particular, the Minister has come under severe pressure in recent years from young drivers who have been carrying a hugely disproportionate burden. The Government and this Minister did nothing in the face of this until the last minute when it was about to dash to the country.</P>
      <P>This is a Government that has frittered away so many fruits of the boom and for five years has done nothing in so many important areas not least in respect of insurance, including motor insurance.</P>
      <P>The country owes a debt to Ms Dorothea Dowling and her board although I doubt the Minister, the insurance division of his Department or the insurance companies would be inclined to agree. We owe Ms Dowling a debt on at least two scores. First, she has put beyond doubt the veracity of thousands of complaints made by ordinary citizens over the years in respect of motor insurance which highlights the desirability for a completely independent insurance ombudsman. I am not reflecting on the current occupant of the post but we remember the circumstances in which the previous occupant departed that position. It is quite clear from the Dowling Report that we ought not to have gone along with that. Second, her report contains many new facts and is a most comprehensive and rigorous piece of work. I do not intend to go through the report in detail. However, I draw attention to some quite remarkable facts that are, to me at least, new.</P>
      <P>Let us address the issue of uninsured driving. This phenomenon is, we are told incessantly by the insurance companies, a scourge that adds significantly to insurance costs in Ireland. I tended to believe that. It is, but what does the Dowling Report tell us about this? It tells us the problem is, in part, of the company's making. I refer to page 11 of the report, executive summary paragraphs 29 and 31 which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mention of uninsured driving would most likely prompt the public to think of some<Col N="1121" /> one who owns a car but has not bothered to pay a premium. In fact, both the car and the driver may hold insurance policies but be involved in an accident where there is no valid insurance. For example, many people would not hesitate to lend their insured car to a friend whose own insured car has broken down. They may not realise that restricted policy terms may result in any subsequent accident being uninsured. Even if a comprehensive policy with a &ldquo;driving other cars&rdquo; extension is held by the borrower, that extension applies only to the third party cover in respect of claimants alleging injury or property damage and would not extend to cover damage to the lender's vehicle. Many years ago vehicle insurance was regularly offered on an &ldquo;open driving&rdquo; basis but such cover is now extremely rare for private policyholders. Consumers might expect that the extent of their insurance cover would be obvious from the wording of their insurance certificate. In fact, the contractual document is the insurance policy and failure to check the wording carefully could result in mistakenly driving without insurance&mdash;</P>
    <P>I do not think a great many consumers know that. Paragraph 31 states:</P>
    <P>A major disparity with the remainder of Europe is the fact that in Ireland, and the UK, motor insurance is based on driver use rather than on the vehicle itself with usage being secondary to issues of cover. That variation partly accounts for the higher levels of &ldquo;uninsured&rdquo; driving quoted for Ireland which includes cases where there was a policy in force on the vehicle but the indemnity is defective. This issue is covered under uninsured driving in the chapter on Claims Costs. It is recommended that detailed consideration be given to amending the Road Traffic Acts to require insurance on the vehicle, as in mainland Europe, rather than allowing denials of indemnity on the basis of the driver's use but with appropriate measures to address the rights of insurers where premiums have been underpaid.</P>
    <P>In fact, it would appear that uninsured driving is in decline. It is stated to be unlikely to be as much as 5%; it may be of the order of between 3% and 4% and in any event is down considerably on the figure of 6.5% recorded in 1991which is down on the figure of 7.7%. What time is available to me, Sir?</P>

It is the kind of issue, given the extent of public concern, not just confined to motor insurance that is ideally suited to investigation by an all-party committee of the House. Like the DIRT inquiry this report could be taken as the book of evidence, so to speak. The Dowling report is equivalent, or similar or analogous to the report carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the tax evasion issue and, therefore, it could be used as the basis for detailed examination by a subcommittee of the House that goes much wider than motor insurance. That would not be to excuse the Government of the day, whatever the complexion of that Government, from proceeding to implement quickly the recommendations of this report. I do not know if the Minister of State said the implementation board will report to him within three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. As the Taoiseach said here last week, this report is the product of more than three years' hard work and it is important that the issues it raises are debated in the Dáil. These are matters which are of major significance to the motorist and to the general public through the knock on effects which high insurance costs can have on the community.</P>
      <P>This report is, by any standards, a <i>tour de force </i>in terms of the data it presents and the comprehensive nature of its analysis. It gives the reader new insights into the workings of the insurance market in Ireland and presents information which was not previously available to the public. Significantly also, it points us towards the action we need to take to alleviate the unacceptably high burden which the insured motorist is asked to bear. Little wonder then that it has aroused such extensive public interest in the past week and it is appropriate that this debate is taking place here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, for its part, has responded <Col N="1123" /> with the utmost speed to the publication of this report. At our meeting on 10 April, we approved the establishment of a high level implementation group representative of the relevant Departments, the Consumer Association of Ireland and IBEC together with the chairperson of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board to immediately progress the recommendations and to report to Government not later than three months' time. The group held its first meeting this morning. Therefore, there is no question of the report being left to lie around with no action taken on its recommendations. On the contrary, these recommendations will be examined in the relevant Departments to see in what way it might be appropriate to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>Of the 67 recommendations made by the MIAB, some 16 might be said to be of relevance to my Department and I now turn to those. As it happens, some of these recommendations have been overtaken to an extent by recent events.</P>
    <P>One example of this is recommendation No. 42 which is to the effect that the legislation on accrual of 8% interest on legal costs from date of trial should be revised in a manner consistent with the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act with a significantly reduced rate of interest and a reasonable period allowed from the date of bill presentation for payment or the resolution of legitimate queries. Section 30 of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 2002, responds to this recommendation in that it provides for changes in the manner in which the interest on costs associated with judgment debts is calculated. In particular, it provides for the application of a rate of 2% per annum from the date a judgment is given to the date when the parties agree costs as between themselves, or the date a certificate of taxation issues, which is appropriate. Thereafter, the interest applicable to judgment debts, 8%, will apply to the outstanding costs until that amount of costs is paid.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the view of the MIAB, expressed in its report, that no interest should be payable until a reasonable period has expired after presentation of the solicitor's bill but it must also be acknowledged that the changes made by the Courts and Court Officers Act, which are already in force and which apply even where the proceedings in question were instituted before the Act was passed, represent a considerable improvement on the position up to now. As regards the continued application of an 8% interest rate to legal costs after they are agreed by the parties or determined either by the taxing master or the county registrar, while this rate may appear high by reference to interest rates generally, it must be borne in mind that the charging of interest has the purpose of encouraging prompt payment by the liable party. When that is an insurance company, I see little justification for delays in paying the sums due either to the plaintiff in the form of damages or to his or her legal representatives in respect of their costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" />A further recommendation which has been responded to in part is No. 43 to the effect that the draft legislation on advertising by solicitors should be progressed. This legislation, the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 2002, was enacted on 13 April. The provisions on advertising require a commencement order to be brought into force and this order will be made when regulations to fill out the detail of what is provided for in the Act are prepared by the Law Society. Commencement of these provisions is a priority as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>This recommendation, and recommendation No. 44, propose a requirement that all advertisements by solicitors quote a summary of section 68 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, which provides that solicitors are prohibited from calculating their charges as a percentage of any damages that become payable. I am of the view that it would be of benefit to draw the attention of the public to this important rule, as its existence may not be widely known, and I will consult the Law Society to see if regulations could be made to implement this proposal.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 57 is to the effect that the Courts Bill should be amended so as not to increase the civil jurisdictions of the Circuit and District courts beyond expressing the existing figures in convenient euro amounts. This Bill is now an Act, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 2002, but requires a commencement order to raise the jurisdiction limit of the Circuit Court from £30,000 to &euro;100,000 and that of the District Court from £5,000 to &euro;20,000.</P>
    <P>While by no means dismissing the view of the MIAB that increasing the jurisdiction limits will increase awards and settlements, it is reasonable to suggest that it is somewhat speculative. I am not sure that decisions as to the courts in which cases shall be taken &ndash; whether District, Circuit or High &ndash; are not matters in which clients have no say. Clients will know that, as a general rule, the lower the court, the lower the costs and they will also know, certainly from this report, that legal costs represent a sizeable proportion of the overall cost of road accident associated damages. I do not believe increased jurisdiction limits mean increased claims and increased damages awards. There can certainly be no justification for leaving the limits completely unchanged, apart from translating them into euros.  Consumer prices have risen by about 30% since the limits were previously set in 1991.</P>
    <P>Inasmuch as damages compensate for such elements as loss of earnings, more expensive vehicles etc. which reflect rapid real economic growth, it could be argued that consumer price inflation does not fully mirror the increase in damages during this period. This means that leaving jurisdiction limits unchanged would have the effect over time of pushing cases of a given level of seriousness into higher courts with higher costs and negative implications for access to justice. For example, I do not consider that a case involving a claim for the equivalent of just more than <Col N="1125" /> £30,000 should be dealt with in the highest court of first instance in the land. The increased jurisdictions will also enhance access to justice in the sense that District and Circuit courts are courts of local jurisdiction located conveniently to those members of the public who need to have recourse to them. I must, therefore, reluctantly beg to differ with the board on this issue.</P>
    <P>In considering the jurisdiction levels of these courts, I met representatives of IBEC and the Irish Insurance Federation. I noted their concerns about the possible effects of the proposed increases in the jurisdictions but stressed to them the need to have regard to the interests of all court users and my anxiety to ensure people have access to court at the lowest possible cost. Courts are there to serve the public. It is important that the public has the cheapest possible access to the courts. In this regard increasing the jurisdictions of the District and Circuit courts can only serve to assist the public.</P>
    <P>The general jurisdiction provisions in the Act will not come into force until I make a commencement order to that effect. Consideration of the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which should have a significant impact on the number of cases that go to court, is well advanced under the aegis of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. I informed the representatives of IBEC and the Irish Insurance Federation that consideration will be given to co-ordinating the commencement of the jurisdiction provisions with the coming into operation of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</P>
    <P>There are a number of recommendations in the report which require consideration by the Courts Service. In this regard, I understand the board of the Courts Service has decided to table consideration of the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board at its next meeting.</P>
    <P>I will be interested to have the views of the Courts Service board on such matters as specialist judges, an extended role for the small claims court and the introduction of a book of quantum. I am prepared to act quickly on any recommendations I get from the board for legislative amendment as necessary.</P>
    <P>The MIAB makes a range of other recommendations affecting my area of ministerial responsibility. Of those, I will briefly refer to a few. As Deputies will observe, these proposals would require legislation and, for that reason alone, they require careful consideration before any Bill is brought before the House. This consideration will commence with the work of the implementation group established by the Government.</P>
    <P>In recommendation number 47, the MIAB proposes that stringent measures should be introduced to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims for the loss of all compensation entitlements and appropriate criminal sanctions should be imposed. I caution that any measures to deal with exaggerated claims would have to be proportional to the wrong one seeks to rectify.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" />In recommendation number 50, the MIAB proposes that the system of lump sum compensation payments should be reviewed on the basis that long-term needs of the seriously injured may be better served by guaranteed annual payments. Recommendation number 51 proposes that a system should be introduced to facilitate pre-trial interim payments to the seriously injured in cases where liability is not a substantial issue but there is a financial need to replace lost earnings or seek medical treatment. Recommendation number 52 proposes the introduction of awards of provisional damages where there is a substantial risk that the injured party's medical condition may deteriorate in the future.</P>
    <P>The latter three recommendations concern issues which have been the subject of a 1996 report of the Law Reform Commission, the recommendations of which have not been addressed by my Department to date due to the substantial programme of legislation in which we were in engaged over the past number of years. The Law Reform Commission proposed that there should be a system of structured settlements to replace the award of damages in the form of lump sums and that there should be provision for interim and provisional awards in certain conditions. Significantly, however, the commission recommended no change in the way awards of damages are calculated by the courts. In other words, these changes would perhaps deliver compensation in a more appropriate way while being neutral in their effect on the aggregate amount of compensation paid in the long-term.</P>
    <P>Much comment has been made before and after the publication of this report on the role of the legal profession in relation to litigation and insurance costs. It is of significance that the Government, as part of its response to a report by the OECD on regulatory reform in Ireland which was published in April 2001, asked the Competition Authority to undertake a study of professional services. Among the professions being studied by the authority is the legal profession and I await, with interest, that report.</P>
    <P>There has also been media comment about the attitude of the Law Society to the work of the MIAB, as described in the report. This is a matter for the society, but it is a cause of regret when any important regulatory and representative body does not lend its assistance to a committee which is mandated by the Government or a Minister to investigate a matter of major public concern. Most people will not, however, consider it a major cause of surprise that the body, which has the task of representing the interests of solicitors, should be cautious and find itself drawn in different directions when it comes to the scrutiny of matters that bear directly on its members' interests. Rather than focus on the approach adopted by the Law Society in this instance, it is more important to confirm that the Government is determined to act on this report.</P>
    <P>The reform of the law on personal injuries is <Col N="1127" /> being kept under review in my Department in consultation with other Departments, particularly having regard to the perceived growth of a compensation culture in our society. The report of the MIAB provides further impetus to the consideration of the law in this area, as if affects claims arising from motor accidents and the recommendations in the report give us guidance on the most useful avenues to explore in our quest for a better system. I caution, however, that persons who are the victims of the negligence of others are entitled to have their rights vindicated by the payment of appropriate compensation and this principle must be respected in any reforms we introduce. We must at the same time endeavour to ensure that compensation is delivered to those who are entitled to it in the most efficient way possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent letter in <i>The Irish Times </i> stated that the new monument of light in O'Connell Street should not be called &ldquo;the spike&rdquo; but &ldquo;the long finger&rdquo; because that title best represented the attitude of Dublin Corporation on many matters. It could well represent the attitude of the Government because it has put many issues on the long finger, this being one such issue.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, there have been previous reports on this matter such as the McAuley report. Deputy Rabbitte also referred to the personal injuries tribunal, with which the Minister just confirmed he will deal. We are talking about the Government record on insurance over the past five years during which it has become a major issue, particularly for young drivers.</P>
      <P>The Green Party is fully committed to making life better for young drivers and for all those people who essentially, to use a colloquial phrase, have been ripped off and exploited. I congratulate Dorothea Dowling for exposing this exploitation. Young motorists have been ripped off and exploited because of vested interests. That is what this report makes clear. It also makes clear the failure of successive Governments to stand up to these vested interests. There are two main bodies in question, the insurance industry and the legal profession. Ms Dowling states in the report that the problem is not accidents; the problem is the cost of claims. Legal expenses, including expert witnesses, now account for just under 40% of the cost of claims and the figure can be even higher in the case of small claims. According to the MIAB, fees can average 72% of the compensation paid out on claims of £5,000 or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major reason legal costs are so high is the extensive use of barristers in even the most minor cases. About 60% of insurance cases here are resolved with the involvement of barristers while the comparative figure in the UK is less than 1%. Some 52% of insurance cases in the UK are settled directly between solicitors and insurance companies. That is why it is necessary to highlight and address this matter. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has left the <Col N="1128" /> Chamber, is a solicitor and many other Members of the House come from a legal background and are either solicitors or barristers. Perhaps that is the reason we have always failed to take on that vested interest. I read in Noel Browne's biography many years ago that when he set out with his grand vision to reform the legal profession, he was told, in blunt terms, by one of his colleagues, &ldquo;you don't touch the law&rdquo;. There has rightly been a split between politics and the Judiciary, but we are the ones who are vested with the power to tackle this problem and we have failed to do so. When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I refer particularly to those in Government. The ball is very much in the Government's court. It has to do the business.</P>
    <P>My party discussed this issue in detail at our party conference. One of my colleagues, councillor Paul Gogarty, who is a young driver said that this issue is a major problem. Deputy Flanagan this morning cited the example of a person who bought a car worth about £1,000 and the cost of insuring it was in the region of £7,000. That level of insurance premium is not unheard of; in fact, it is quite common. The other day I spoke to a man aged about 30 years of age who is paying a motor insurance premium of &euro;3,000. It has got to the stage where people have become cynical and outraged by what is going on.</P>
    <P>We can consider the position in other countries. We talked about the question of uninsured vehicles. That does not happen in New Zealand because the cost of insurance there is included in the price of petrol. Simple measures could be taken to improve the position. It is outrageous that a young motorist who is a named driver and has not had an accident for five years is expected to pay such a high level of premium.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations at our conference was the introduction of a voluntary R plate scheme, which would reduce considerably motor premia for young drivers. If we implemented the recommendations in the report, insurance costs would decrease for all motorists. We need to pay special attention to the motorists aged between 17 and 24 years of age. The myth in respect of that category of motorist must be nailed. I tried to raise that on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; the other night when a representative from the insurance industry claimed that the industry is making a loss on that category of motorist. That is not true. The report makes it clear that in respect of motorists aged between 17 and 24 years of age, there is an annual profit of &euro;160 per driver. That is the reality and that is what Dorothea Dowling said in her report. For that reason, I urge the Minister of State to do everything he can to improve the position of young motorists. This is the last full day of this Dáil and, hopefully, a new far-seeing Administration, which will not put matters on the long finger, will be in power following the election. Whoever is in power must tackle this scandalous problem. We in the Green Party are committed to tackling it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>)<b>: </b>The Motor <Col N="1129" /> Insurance Advisory Board report is to be warmly welcomed for its clarity and the forthright way it sets out its analysis and conclusions. I have only read the executive summary so far because the full report will take a considerable amount of time to study in detail. However, based on that executive summary, the report has the ring of integrity about it and in ways it is an extraordinary and unusual report in the forthright way it sets out its analysis and recommendations.</P>
      <P>Frankly, the report amounts to a damning indictment of the motor insurance industry and makes clear we are in the hands of a cartel which has sown up the motor insurance industry. The Minister of State pointed out that there are just five insurance companies now compared to 17 in the market in 1993. There is no doubt whatsoever that there are understandings between the big five as to how they operate their codes of practice, premiums etc.</P>
      <P>The letter from Ms Dorothea Dowling, the chair of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, to the Minister of State is remarkable in many ways. No responsibility can be ascribed to Ms Dowling for my interpretation of her feelings in this letter, which is a model of understated anger, to put it mildly, or even perhaps contempt for sections of the motor insurance industry for the way in which it approached this examination and the way in which it patently failed to co-operate with the examination and the board set up to look at the industry. She instanced that, in front of an Oireachtas committee of which I am a member, representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation rubbished the so-called unreliable data on which some initial findings were based. What was rubbished was the raw data supplied by the federation itself, as Ms Dowling points out.</P>
      <P>We should pay particular heed to some of the sentences in the report's executive summary regarding the reluctance of the insurance cartels to co-operate with the examination set up by the State on behalf of the people. The summary states that it &ldquo;has not been this board's experience that insurers have willingly provided all material information in the fulsome manner which the Minister is entitled to expect would be accorded to a body established under his authority.&rdquo;  The report goes on to state that board members &ldquo;cannot avoid the conclusion that many insurers did not willingly provide essential hard data and/or did not do so in a timely, conscientious and co-operative manner.&rdquo;  I am surprised the Minister of State did not make ringing criticisms of the lack of co-operation from the insurance cartels with the board he set up to render a service to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These statements are made in a more understated and dignified way than I would make them and the board found it extremely difficult to get co-operation and to obtain figures on which it could base an accurate assessment of the situation. It begs the question, why the reluctance? Some of the findings of the report show precisely why that reluctance existed. The companies <Col N="1130" /> wanted to cover up the real situation within the motor insurance industry and the fact that it is ten to 11 times more profitable than its British counterpart, for example. When that truth came out it gave the lie to the poor mouth the insurance cartels have been putting on for the past year or two since this issue came strongly into public focus. That is the reason, the industry was self-serving.</P>
    <P>Another statement in the report is startling for its honesty and because it is troubling: &ldquo;It is difficult to have any great confidence that the high cost of insurance will alter radically in the near future, as the current situation suits too many interests.&rdquo;  The interests outlined are the insurers, the legal profession and the State. The report fears that there will not be change because those three vested interests will block reform for the benefit of hundreds of thousands of consumers. That would be very serious if it were allowed to stand. It means in essence that the vested interests of a tiny minority would continue to see the exploitation of the majority to serve the profits of the insurance companies and the already bloated incomes of the legal profession. It is an incredible finding that litigation costs add 40% to every euro paid in compensation for injuries sustained in motor accidents. That is an incredible statistic.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a small minority of interests have sown up the legal profession, a closed shop open for the most part to the most privileged minority in society and which successive Governments and the big parties will not take on &ndash; they have many members of the legal profession in their ranks and among their supporters. That contrasts with their attitude to secondary teachers or nurses, who find they must take action to protect their rights. The Minister of State should state clearly what he makes of that sentence in the report. Will he say that situation will alter radically because the vested interests will be taken on? That is what the ordinary driver wants to see.</P>
    <P>Apart from motorists generally, young drivers have been particularly discriminated against. This is also borne out in the report and there is a fundamental issue of natural justice here. Young drivers should not be condemned when they sit behind the wheel of a car before their record is known or before they are involved in accidents.</P>
    <P>Many young people are responsible drivers and need their cars for employment and for social reasons, particularly in rural areas. Such people have to be regarded in the same light as any other citizen and given a level playing pitch in terms of premiums. If people offend they can be penalised. However, it is unjust to penalise good and responsible drivers in the interests of the profits of insurance companies. I am glad that young drivers have found a voice through the motor insurance justice action group which has spear-headed their interests and complaints. Public representatives are being obliged to hear this voice during this general election. This is a positive development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" />The report contains 67 recommendations, some of which are useful. I highlight the recommendation regarding the introduction of a road safety and driver education syllabus in schools. This proposal should be put in train immediately to provide young drivers with the necessary skills before they take to the roads, to educate them as to their responsibilities, the nature of the vehicle in which they sit and control and its potential for devastation if abused. Such things should be taught in a practical manner and not through books or videos, and should be included in the curriculum. A qualification in, and knowledge of, driving and safety procedures could then be a basis for obtaining a just premium and not one charging thousands of euro as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>The motor insurance industry cartel should be taken into public ownership. It should not be left for the most part to private, faceless people to exploit and control such a significant sector of the economy which has a real effect on people's lives. The industry should be in public ownership and run under the democratic control of consumers, the workers in the industry and State representatives. The industry should be the subject of root and branch reform including the premia demanded, the manner in which accident claims are regulated and compensation payments. This should be done in the interests of people rather than the vested interests.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State tell the House what he will do to take on these interests to ensure that we are not back here at the end of the next Dáil with a similar litany of woes regarding the manner in which the motor insurance industry is rigged?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the MIAB report on motor insurance and congratulate and thank the board for a comprehensive and detailed report which obviously involved much hard work. Eight of the 67 recommendations in the report relate to the area of responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of the report is timely in that it follows the recent passage through the Oireachtas of the Road Traffic Act, 2002. That Act contains a range of measures to be delivered within the policy parameters established in the Government's road safety strategy. That strategy presented for the first time a co-ordinated approach to the pursuit of specified goals regarding road safety nationally. It set challenging targets in terms of reducing road deaths and serious injuries and it is clear that, as a result of the pursuit of the policies set forth in the strategy, significant progress has been achieved in realising those targeted goals. However, the strategy must not just be seen in the context of those targets. Its greatest strength is the fact that it promoted a <Col N="1132" /> series of policy initiatives that will encourage a changed approach to driving and to the need for a greater appreciation of safety.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence that the commitment of the Garda in carrying out its enforcement role has yielded results. Detection of drink driving offences in 2001 was 53% higher than in 1998, on-the-spot fine notices for not wearing seat belts, introduced in 1999, were issued in respect of 59,000 people in 2000 and 64,000 in 2001, and on-the-spot fine notices for speeding offences issued in 2001 are 165% higher than in 1998.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 2002, will further augment and support the enforcement of traffic legislation. The introduction of penalty points, the replacement of the on-the-spot fine system with the more structured and certain system of fixed charges and the extended use of cameras to assist in the detection of offences will help to further promote the precautionary approach to driving that will lead to sustained improvement in road safety. The Act will also specifically extend the preliminary breath testing of drivers where they are involved in a road accident or a breach of road traffic law. It will also provide a framework for implementing the European convention on driving disqualification which permits the imposition by member states of driving disqualification for offences committed in another member state and it will increase certain financial penalties for road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>There is no reason Ireland should not rank among the best states in Europe in terms of road safety and the new Act, together with the application of the other initiatives in the strategy, will progress our realisation of that goal.</P>
    <P>The driver theory test has been operational since 11 June 2001 and tests knowledge of topics such as the rules of the road, risk perception, hazard awareness and good driving behaviour. This test should encourage a deeper understanding by novice drivers of information and behaviours that will assist them to become safe drivers.</P>
    <P>As regards the driver testing service, I am pleased that we have met our customer service target of ten weeks. The average waiting time for a driving test is ten weeks or less. This is a significant achievement in the face of a continuing and unprecedented high level of demand for the service and is the result of significant additional resources allocated to the driver testing service by this Government.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the report call for the introduction of a road safety and driver education syllabus in schools. The question of introducing such a syllabus in schools is a matter for the Minister for Education and Science and is currently being examined by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment which has commissioned a study of the issue at the request of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>In the area of driver education generally, the National Safety Council has launched special educational programmes for primary and second<Col N="1133" /> ary schools and major publicity campaigns targeting drink driving, seat belt wearing and speeding have been produced.</P>
    <P>A number of the recommendations deal with the relationship between compulsory motor insurance requirements in this country and the four EU directives on the topic. The particular recommendations make a number of salient points about ways in which the position of victims of road accidents might be improved. My Department is working on the implementation of the fourth motor insurance directive which provides a good opportunity to examine ways to more speedily implement the recommendations in question.</P>
    <P>A number of the recommendations will need to be explored further by the implementation group before they can be acted on. For example, as regards the recommendation that a car could be confiscated if the driver is not covered by insurance, it may be that existing legislation provides sufficient authority for seizure of a vehicle. Similarly, the right of an injured party to proceed directly against the other party's insurance company seems to be substantively provided for in the Road Traffic Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>The question of whether the vehicle or the user should be insured is raised in the MIAB report. As the report records, there are a number of significant cost and liability concerns in such a change. These will have to be explored by the implementation group before a decision can be made on the prudence of such a fundamental alteration to insurance law.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and thank its authors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The MIAB report has been long awaited. Even longer awaited was action from the Government to end the fleecing of drivers and other consumers by the insurance companies and the legal profession.</P>
      <P>The report is a damning indictment of the insurance industry and of successive Governments which have failed to tackle the vested interests that need to be challenged. The practices of commercial insurers of insuring only those they deem to be almost risk free, or least risk, or of imposing exorbitant premiums on young drivers are unacceptable. These practices only encourage people to drive without insurance thereby becoming a liability on the State if involved in a serious accident where an injured party has to sue the State for compensation. The incidence of this has risen in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An AA report last year showed huge differentials in how premiums were calculated for drivers. Another short survey showed some companies giving different quotes to phone customers than to those who made Internet queries. This points to a market hugely exploiting its customers. The State should take car insurance out of the private sector and establish its own insurance corporation modelled on existing state companies in, for example, British Colombia and New Zealand. These companies have proved their viability and <Col N="1134" /> contribute to better road safety through involvement in every aspect of road awareness projects. In setting premiums, such a company would not discriminate on the basis of age, sex or marital status. Teenage children could be added to their parents insurance normally and, I hope, at no extra cost. This company might also offer extra discounts for senior citizens with clean driving records.</P>
    <P>Other problems which must be tackled are better funded road safety initiatives, a reduction in the huge numbers of provisional drivers on our roads and reform of the court or legal system which deals with compensation claims. That area merits immediate attention. It is unacceptable that young people are being discriminated against when it comes to car insurance thereby forcing many of them to drive uninsured and to be, as a consequence, an even bigger threat to other road users. We need action. Following on tomorrow's expected rise of this Dáil a new administration must take action to stop the rip-off of consumers by the insurance industry. The rip-off is not confined to motor insurance. We need to look at insurance in general. There should be Government imposed price control of insurance, and if this requires a change of law at EU level that must be pursued.</P>
    <P>We need measures to reduce the cost of personal injury claims. We must simplify the legal process to ensure that cases are settled speedily and that the number of false claims is reduced. Gross profiteering by the legal profession must be rooted out. This point is highlighted in the report which found that some solicitors are guilty of misconduct by deducting a percentage of awards made to clients injured in road traffic accidents. Like other powerful vested interests, the legal profession is not subject to independent scrutiny. It polices itself, if at all. There is no proper protection for the ordinary citizen. This must change so that abuses can be tackled. There should be an immediate investigation into blatant discrimination against younger drivers by insurance companies. I hope the new administration will adopt such action as a priority immediately following the general election.</P>
    <P>I agree with other Deputies who have spoken and I too urge the introduction of driver training at second school level. Transition year is the ideal time to start programmes of awareness, competency and understanding. By introducing driver training in transition year we would ensure that young drivers are better prepared for the roads and for their responsibilities as drivers, their responsibilities to themselves, their passengers and all road users. That measure, if proactively pursued and properly introduced to the curriculum, would result in a significant reduction in the tragic carnage we have witnessed in recent years on a weekly basis throughout this island. We must agree that this measure is an imperative. We cannot start it early enough and transition year is the ideal opportunity. In that year young people have the chance to absorb and experience new infor<Col N="1135" /> mation and responsibilities as they prepare for life after second level education.</P>
    <P>I recommend these ideas to the Minister and I hope action will be taken by the incoming Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this issue. It is ironic that we end the Dáil session on one of the most important issues. We have heard criticism from across the benches on how much has been or has not been done on the issue of motor insurance costs. Ultimately, what we have here is three years of diligent consideration of what is a complex issue. If it was not as complex we would not have a report of this size which makes 67 recommendations. I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, on the initiative, for seizing the issue and coming up with what are seen to be the problems that exist within the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>If that initiative had not been taken we would be exactly where we were before &ndash; we could talk about the issues. We had our own ideas of what the problems were but until problems are put down on paper and adjudicated fairly nothing can be done. As the Minister said, this is the road map. This shows us clearly what the problems are and how they can be addressed. They will not all be addressed the same way, some need legislation and some need referring to other bodies. It is significant that after three years we have recommendations that must be implemented. I am delighted by the speed with which the Minister has reacted to the report and that the implementation group has been set up. As of today, it has had its first meeting and must report back in three months' time.</P>
      <P>It is great to have the report but as many Deputies are aware, many reports are only dust collectors. Unless something is done with the reports they will only collect dust. I am confident, because of the way this report has been received, that it will not be added to any list of dust-collecting reports. This report will inspire action and I trust it will yield results.</P>
      <P>In the constituency from which I come, as in many other constituencies, a car is not a luxury but a vital component of daily life. Many people in my constituency are not on a bus route and I do not need to add that we are not on a train route either as there are no trains. We are completely reliant on cars and not just one car but two. Anyone who has started the campaign trail knows that one can find two cars outside a house and assume one will meet someone at the door, only to find that the householder is away in the third car. The car is vital to every family in rural areas who cannot get from A to B without it. A car is vital to every aspect of my job. People need cars to get to their jobs or to get to hospital appointments because they may be away from the bus route or out of the way for taxis. Having a car is not a luxury, it is vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" />Car insurance costs do not hit only young people, although I agree that young people have been unfairly targeted. I have had young people come to me and show me the price of their cars and the price of their insurance and it is frightening. I have spoken to young people who say that the only reason they are employed is to keep their cars on the road. There must be more to life than this. It should not be this way; insurance should not be five, six or seven times the value of one's car. However, insurance is also increasingly an issue for the old and for all age groups. We heard much about how the events of 11 September resulted in very high prices for car insurance as well as for all types of insurance. However, I have been told by many people who have talked to Americans that car insurance and insurance generally has not changed at all in the USA. If these changes are not occurring where the real trouble happened, namely in the USA, I would love to know why the events of 11 September have had such an effect on our insurance. I am aware of community groups here whose insurance for running festivals went up by 300%.</P>
    <P>I am worried that the price of insurance may be contributing to the problem of people driving while uninsured. The report says that the costs of uninsured drivers add 8% to the cost of claims in the aggregate motor insurance market. A person came to me saying that their insurance, which had been £2,400 per year, had gone up to £4,500 after a minor accident which resulted in the person they had bumped into making a large claim. This person lives about 40 miles from their employment and they have no alternative way of getting there. They are currently on an apprentice's wage of between &euro;190 and &euro;254 per week. The situation encourages people to go without insurance because they simply cannot afford it and they have no alternative means of transport. This is all the more reason for us to implement the recommendations in this report.</P>
    <P>I am not against companies making a fair profit but I am totally against exploitation and it is clear from this report that certain sections of our community are being exploited. The situation may be compared to that of Northern Ireland. Because I am from Donegal and our lives are intertwined with those from counties such as Derry, I cannot help but compare the two. A person in Northern Ireland can buy a new car and get the first year or two years of car insurance free, plus a reduction in road tax. How can this happen? How can a young person buy a car for maybe £8,000 sterling with two years of car insurance incorporated? These people are not safer drivers &ndash; they are the same age group as the people who are in difficulties here. Yet car insurance can be given out as part of the car. One would never see that here: many people are paying £8,000 for their insurance, never mind a new car.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about shopping around and I agree wholeheartedly. I have never tried to obtain car insurance without phoning a number of companies. I am always asked immediately <Col N="1137" /> whether I have another quote. I pick a figure out of the air and the company is nearly always able to give me a cheaper quote immediately. There is something wrong if the quoted price can often be at least &euro;100 cheaper than a made-up one. Some 67% of the market is currently controlled by three companies. This is a problem in terms of shopping around because people need motor insurance to drive their cars and if three companies are monopolising this much of the market it cannot be competitive. The recommendations on this issue need to be considered. People are also being refused quotations. I am glad that one of the recommendations deals with the issue of late notices &ndash; notification should be given 15 days before a person's current insurance runs out because if one receives no notice one does not have time to shop around even those few companies.</P>
    <P>Another issue came to my attention while I was teaching in Derry. If one told the insurance companies that one was living in Donegal and working in Derry, some of them would not give quotes. I do not know whether this still goes on but I thought it was a strange thing to be happening on this island. Legal fees need to be addressed as there is no doubt that they are adding to costs. People are always indicating to me that VRT needs to be abolished or reduced. VRT should be ring-fenced so that young people's insurance can be dealt with. If people could see that their VRT was going towards something that would benefit them, be it a reduction in insurance or some mechanism for dealing with the cost of insurance, we would be getting somewhere. Ring fencing needs to be introduced.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are many safe drivers on the road. I am glad to see that the Minister has acknowledged that young females, as the report says, are being hit particularly hard and that this has already resulted in reduced quotations for some young drivers. If nothing else, the report has clearly exposed what is going on. It makes 67 recommendations and I am looking forward to watching the next Government &ndash; hopefully we will be sitting on the same side &ndash; implement some very important legislation. I am sorry to have run out of time as there is so much to say about this. I wish the Minister well in implementing the recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this report. This report was prepared very late in the lifetime of the Government but this issue is of grave concern to motorists, particularly young motorists. Deputy Keaveney indicated that she hoped the issue would be taken up by the next Government and that she would still be on the same side of the House. However, if the next Government makes as little progress on motor insurance as the present Government, nothing will change. I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has answered numerous parliamentary questions on this issue and his presence in the <Col N="1138" /> Chamber to answer questions and give us his and the Government's proposals was a highlight of the last Dáil term.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister of State's words did not translate into action to any great extent. While I appreciate that the report, which contains 67 recommendations, has been brought before the House, it is no consolation for young motorists whose annual motor insurance bill is over &euro;1,000. The Government's performance in this area has been woefully inadequate. Deputy Keaveney raised the pertinent question of why young drivers in the North can be insured for much less than their counterparts in the South. I appreciate that the Government has had many priorities, but it is a shame the issue of motor insurance has not received the political attention it has warranted in recent years.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry as a whole faced a crisis in the aftermath of 11 September and premia in many areas increased. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, knows that small businesses have suffered as a result of the steep rises in insurance costs. It is too late for the Minister of State to address insurance costs for those in the recycling industry in the current Dáil, but perhaps officials from his Department will examine the matter. I have received many queries from those involved in the industry who are carrying out work which is needed to protect our environment. They do not complain that the premia they are quoted are too high, but that it is impossible to receive a quotation for public liability insurance. In my constituency, it is likely that 15 people will be laid off next week because insurance cover is being withdrawn from the operator of a recycling facility and he cannot find alternative cover. The crisis in all sectors of the insurance industry needs to be addressed urgently.</P>
      <P>Returning to the specific matter of the impact of the excessive cost of motor insurance on young drivers, I suggest a number of areas which are worthy of examination. One has to concede that this country's compensation culture is partly responsible for premium increases. Our accident rate is not substantially higher than the European average, but the average cost of claims is much greater. Although Deputies have been aware of this for many years, it has not been addressed. Questions have to be answered by those involved in the legal profession, especially bearing in mind recent Sunday newspaper reports about the breakdown of insurance claims. Many people other than claimants are benefiting to a great extent from recent changes in the insurance industry. The cost of such gains is usually carried by ordinary motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look seriously at the legal response to insurance claims. The imposition of limits on claims may have to be considered. When juries were removed from compensation cases some years ago, it was predicted that awards would decrease with a resultant reduction in insurance premia, but this has not happened. We cannot afford to do nothing because if premia continue <Col N="1139" /> to rise as they have done in recent years, insurance costs will reach an all-time high.</P>
    <P>Driving a car is no longer a luxury, it is an absolute necessity for many people from an employment point of view. We have to aspire to a fair rate of insurance, particularly for young drivers. Fine Gael has proposed certain measures to improve the driving skills of young people and I believe our suggestions should be implemented. If we can reduce the number of road accidents, the number of claims will also fall. This can be achieved by concentrating on issues such as skills, instruction, safety and observance of the rules of the road. These are basic matters, but we have been unable to emphasise them to the necessary extent. The rules of the road are not observed by many motorists and our driving instruction and testing system is, frankly, failing miserably. I welcome the suggestion that a registered network of driving schools be established.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that approximately 50% of candidates pass the driving test, which indicates that it is something of a lottery. One wonders if instruction methodology has changed as improvements in driver skills are not evident on our roads. The proposal that transition year students be taught the rules of the road and basic driving skills should be considered as the earlier one is properly instructed in driving skills, the better for all concerned. I hope driver instruction issues will be examined and the testing system reviewed and revamped. I would like the lottery of the present driving test system to be replaced by a system whereby applicants for a full driving licence have to take a set number of lessons from a registered instructor. Most people take two or three lessons a week or two before their test, which is not conducive to learning good driving skills or habits.</P>
    <P>Progress can be made by implementing common sense measures. I have mentioned the lack of observance of the rules of the road. Speed limits are ignored by most drivers, and road signs, which are generally ineffective, are ignored. I have asked on a number of occasions in this House and at meetings of Cork County Council that our signage be modernised and improved as dramatic and more clearly visible signs would be much more effective. Our response in relation to such issues always seems to be slow, however. I appreciate that my time is nearly up.</P>

      <P>I reiterate the sentiments that <Col N="1140" /> have been expressed by Deputy Bradford. This report and its recommendations must be commended and, more importantly, implemented. The newspapers say that no Government will implement them because of vested interests. I find that extremely hard to take because every Member of this House represents people who have been badly affected by the dramatic increase in insurance premia over the years and is particularly aware that young people must pay exorbitant premia to drive on our roads if they stay within the law. We have always contended that those premia were too high and asked if the statements from the motor insurance companies were correct. We asked if they were making a profit from other sectors of the motor insurance industry while levying too much on young people and tarring all of them with the same brush.</P>
      <P>Inevitably, as the statistics show, there is a higher rate of accidents among the young than among the 25 to 65 age group. Questions have arisen about how we monitor young people with a provisional licence, whether they should be allowed to drive on motorways and about other legislation that is not being adhered to. Having said that, many sympathise and empathise with young people as the vast majority of them stay within the law. Most of us who are parents of young people know that the vast majority of them who go out at the weekend will not drive a car if they are going for a drink because they understand that drinking and driving is not acceptable. I wish I could say the same of our age group who grew up with the habit of driving with a few drinks. These young people are nevertheless penalised. I stated often before that we accept in the private health insurance industry that young people, who have fewer claims than the elderly, must pay the community rate. In other words, we accept that old people will have more claims but ask healthy young people to pay the same rate as them. Yet, for motor insurance, it is not politically correct to say that each of us should take a fair share of the burden. The older age group do not have the same level of motor accidents but we will not ask them to foot the bill in the same way as the young do for health insurance.</P>
      <P>Many people drive without insurance. The Minister should take back to his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, two issues that came to my notice recently. One arose before we introduced legislation relating to traders &ndash; I say traders as against Travellers. After these people move illegally onto sites, when gardaí come to check their tax and insurance, they discover in many instances that the addresses given are fictitious. The time has come to ensure that legitimate addresses are given for motor taxation and insurance purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue that came to light recently is the buying of bangers. People buy old cars cheaply and drive them without tax or insurance. When such cars are involved in an accident, innocent parties suffer. I know of a young woman who bought a car for the first time and was struck by <Col N="1141" /> another car that had no insurance. The cost of the accident was £4,000 and she is still seeking redress. What action can be taken against a person who drives without insurance? This charge is levied against non-nationals, and it is true in certain instances, but it is also true that many nationals drive without insurance. The excuse made is that they cannot afford it, but under no circumstances can we condone anyone driving without insurance, in danger of maiming people or damaging vehicles and causing huge problems for people who are on the road legitimately. We should ask anyone who is buying a car to produce proof that he or she is able to insure it and get an indication from an insurance company to that effect. The onus should be on the person selling a car to ensure that the vendor can insure it.</P>
    <P>We believed for a long time that this industry was ripping off sections of the community. The Minister was criticised, particularly by Deputy Rabbitte, for not acting on the interim report. How nice that sounds coming from him. If the Minister had done that and the final report differed dramatically from the interim, Deputy Rabbitte would be loud in saying that the Minister was intemperate for establishing a body which was asked to report to him and then took action before its final report was produced. He would accuse the Minister of being out of his depth, of acting in haste and being irresponsible. How a responsible Deputy like Deputy Rabbitte could criticise the Minister for waiting for the final report, beggars belief. The only conclusion that we can come to is that the Member is playing politics on the eve of an election being called.</P>
    <P>This report is outstanding. I was a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business where we had several hearings with the various parties such as the industry itself. When its representatives came before us, we met with the same obfuscation that the board encountered. After one such hearing, I asked the Government at a meeting of the parliamentary party to give us the statutory powers to investigate it fully. Since then, courts have judged that we cannot go down that road as we might infringe people's personal integrity or defame them.</P>
    <P>The report before us points to two major issues that could be addressed by any Government, and I thank the Minister for giving a commitment to address them. The legal system creams off 40% of the cost of claims. There are too many claims and these people are encouraged in this practice. It is not before time that the proposed board, which does not have the support of vested interests, is set up. Well done to the Minister of State. He should get on top of this issue and undertake a full investigation of the insurance industry to ensure companies are not reaping significant profits unlike their counterparts throughout Europe. If the Minister of State goes down that road, he will have the support of everybody, and of young people in particular who finally have a report that a Government can act on to reduce premiums to a level that suits all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the report was published recently is that the Minister of State, his comrades and every other Member have been listening at the doorstep to young people and their parents complaining about insurance premiums, particularly in rural areas where there is not an adequate public transport system and people depend on cars. There is no doubt a car is a dangerous weapon if it is not in the right hands because it is high powered. I offer my sympathies to the families of the two gardaí who were killed the weekend before last as they were doing their duty. One of them was from my county. We saw the damage that can be done when young people drive high powered cars.</P>
      <P>If one is a soldier, one is trained to shoot a gun. Others must have a licence to use a gun. However, a 17 year old can drive the highest powered car available on a provisional licence. There is nothing illegal about that because no legislative provision has been made to ensure people learn how to drive properly. The time has come to teach young people how to drive. The first step should to be to make driving a subject in the leaving certificate curriculum.</P>
      <P>Training centres are not available to teach young people and there are not enough instructors to cope with demand. There is a nine month waiting list for those who wish to do their driving test, although I acknowledge that has been reduced over the past few years. Training centres should be provided for young people where they can be taught how to drive properly before they reach the legal driving age and they should have to pass a number of tests rather than doing it the other way around where they can drive high powered vehicles when they reach 17 and learn to drive on the road. That does not make sense.</P>
      <P>I am glad insurance companies have been investigated and I hope the Minister of State will ensure further investigation is carried out because they have come out of this report very badly. Their representative tried to defend the indefensible in the national media. One cannot defend charging young people £5,000 for insurance. In many cases the insurance premium costs more than the car itself and that does not make sense. People should be penalised if they commit a crime but an individual should not have to pay dearly for insurance until he or she is involved in a crash or has to take out a claim for theft, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the insurance companies have a part to play. Many of them do not even bother to take on young people. All insurance companies should <Col N="1143" /> take on a quota of young drivers at a reasonable rate and provide them with an opportunity to be insured and if they put in a claim, they should have to stay with the company with whom they are insured. I would have no problem if their premiums were loaded in those circumstances but it is wrong that their policies are loaded without them having had an accident.</P>
    <P>Young people complain to politicians and ask what can be done. The Minister of State said he is restricted under EU law. This issue reminds me of the top-up scheme. We have been told for the past three months that consent was being awaited from Europe for the scheme but the Government is paying out now, even though consent has not been granted. Is it not amazing that when we want to we can use European laws to our advantage and disadvantage?</P>
    <P>That is why the referendum on the Nice treaty was defeated. Europe was blamed for all the bad news and Members blamed Europe for most of the legislation being introduced in the House. It is no wonder people were confused and felt they could not vote in favour of the Nice treaty. It is time laws were introduced in this Parliament to help young people by providing that insurance companies take on young people and prevent claims that are made on a daily basis with the encouragement of barristers and solicitors. I am sorry I did not stay in school because I missed my vocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had stayed in school, I would have made a good barrister and would have made a great deal of money if I had been working at one of the tribunals. The vested interests in insurance companies and in the legal profession must be taken on and the Government will have to set thresholds for the amounts awarded for various accidents. Anyone who has a serious accident is entitled to significant compensation. However, the first thing someone who has a minor tip does is put on a collar because that is worth £30,000 in compensation. That culture must cease.</P>
      <P>A database of compensation claims must be put in place. There are individuals throughout the country who seem to be in court on a full-time basis pursuing claims under car or public liability insurance policies. People who regularly take up claims in court must be challenged and shown up for what they are. Insurance companies should be doing this anyway. A friend told me about a case that was being settled not for pounds, shillings and pence but for guineas. However, the poor young people and their parents are the guinea pigs because they must pay higher insurance premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a shame that this serious problem has not been tackled during the lifetime of the Government and the new Government will have to <Col N="1144" /> address it. I hope the parties involved will make a better fist of it than the present Administration and I would like something to be done about the loading of policies taken out by young people.</P>
    <P>The horse has been put before the cart in regard to car testing. It would be better if roads were built first, signage was put in place and young people were taught how to drive in training centres rather than loading their policies. What have we got against signage? The Department of the Environment and Local Government is very good at erecting 30 mph speed limit signs.</P>
    <P>The Garda does not deserve credit for issuing speeding tickets for violation in 30 mph zones at 10 o'clock at night. If one left the city centre now, one would not travel a mile in the next hour but if one travelled later tonight one would probably get a speeding ticket for exceeding the 30 mph limit when trying to make up time. Innocent people are penalised and they turn against the Government, politicians in general and the system. They are not criminals. All they are trying to do is to make up time at night. A driver travelling at 100 mph is the one who should be brought before the courts and prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the number of on-the-spot fines which have been imposed. I tabled a question, the reply to which I am told I will receive tomorrow if we are still here&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what will happen. It will be the first decision the Government will have taken in five years and it will probably be taken tomorrow.</P>
      <P>It is a shame we did not tackle insurance companies before this to give young people an opportunity to be insured. It is wrong that they are being penalised, that proper training is not in place for them and that a system does not exist whereby each insurance company accepts a quota of them.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted by a number of civil servants regarding the privatisation of driver testing centres. Will the people in those centres remain as civil servants, will they be obliged to seek alternative employment or will they be transferred to other sections of the Civil Service? I would not like this service to be privatised. I would rather if the State retained control of it and that more centres were built throughout the country to teach young people how to drive properly. Perhaps the Minister of State will deal with this in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to make a few points on this issue. I hope the next time we debate it young people will have an oppor<Col N="1145" /> tunity to obtain insurance at a reasonable price. It is time the insurance companies were tackled.</P>

      <P>I was a member of Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which helped bring about the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report. I compliment the committee on its sterling work on this issue. Some might ask what it achieved. The fact the report is with the Minister of State is proof of its achievements.</P>
      <P>I found the representatives of the motor insurance industry who attended meetings of the committee to be very glib. It was very difficult to obtain information from them and it was obvious they were singing from the same hymn sheet. They were crying poverty and almost indicating that they were offering charity by giving insurance to young people. The mid-term report, which was issued about 12 months ago, indicated clearly that motor insurance for young people was profitable. The Minister of State was right not to act on that report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>He had to wait for the final report. Now that he has it, the can of worms has been opened. This industry must be tackled. There is no hiding place. The glib comments of the insurance representatives who appeared before the committee have been revealed for what they are. It is clear there is no competition and that young people are being ripped off and form a profitable part of the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>I do not have a problem with profitability. I want to see profitable companies. I do not want circumstances similar to England where, at less than 1%, the profit margin is much tighter than in Ireland. I want to see stable companies doing well and holding assets. The difficulty is that profitability is achieved by levying substantial premiums. That must be dealt with. It is wrong that young people are being made scapegoats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the highest regard for young people. We have the best group of young people and they face a challenging world which is very different from that which existed when I and the Minister of State were growing up. They are able to deal <Col N="1146" /> with that. Everything is out in the open. It is an open agenda. The attractions available to them and the culture of socialising have changed. The vast majority of young people are fine citizens, yet despite this they are all tarred with the same brush. As for the small percentage who are not, it is not their fault. It is the parenting they receive and the areas in which they live. The State is negligent in that it is not able to help them and deal with them.</P>
    <P>In a rural constituency such as mine, Cavan-Monaghan, a car is not a luxury; it is a necessity. Not all young people live near their work and they must have a car because there is no public transport. To be in the workplace at 8 a.m. necessitates getting up at 7 a.m. and using the car to travel there. The alternative is staying at home and collecting the dole, but that is not what we want. We must facilitate young people to get to and from work. They are also entitled to use their cars to socialise.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a problem with speeding and serious crashes caused by a small number of young people. Most youngsters are responsible. This problem can be dealt with if we look at it from this aspect. We should compensate young people who are safe drivers, but this is not done. All young people are tarred with the same brush. The annual no-claims bonus reduction in premiums no longer applies. There is an annual increase and no encouragement for young people, who need to be encouraged. A young person is entitled to have a car, which he or she can usually buy second-hand, and to reasonable insurance. Where there is an accident, it is natural to expect the insurance premium to increase, but why should all young people be forced to pay the same heavy premium?</P>
    <P>The number of cars on the market means a young person can buy a good quality second-hand car for between &euro;3,000 and &euro;5,000. I thank God there are no more old cars on the roads anymore. Cars registered in 1999, 2000 and 2001 are commonplace on garage forecourts. It is not the purchase of a car which is the problem. It is that the insurance premium can be equal to or greater than the price of the car, and this is an annual payment. The income of young people starting out in the world of work is tied up in their cars. That is wrong and it does not encourage them. We must address this problem. If insurance companies are not prepared to do it, the Government must. The Minister of State will have responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>I cannot say if the Dáil will be dissolved tomorrow, although the Minister of State knows, but the world is not coming to an end tomorrow. A new Government will be in place, Fine Gael will form it and I pledge that we will deal with this problem. Time has run out on the Minister of State but his successor will not turn a blind eye to what he has achieved. He has obtained the report, although it was difficult to get it. It was like pulling teeth from a goose. The industry backtracked and held back, but we have the report and some<Col N="1147" /> thing on which to work. The next Government, which will be a Fine Gael one although I will work with whatever Government is in power, must deal with the issue of insurance for young people. I will insist on our party leader, who will be Taoiseach after the general election, pledging that this issue will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I see the difficulty young people in my rural constituency have and I am sure it is similar for large urban areas. Given the type of employment available in multinational companies which work around the clock and where the working day is no longer nine to five and is more likely to be a 12 hour shift, even where public transport is available, it is neither suitable nor convenient. Time is of the essence when one clocks in and works for these companies.</P>
    <P>The claims culture in this country must be addressed. Deputy Ring referred to the behaviour of legal and insurance people in this regard. Perhaps we will see that we have been pointing the finger in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is interested in the general area of insurance and although it is not relevant to this debate I wish to raise the issue of small businesses closing down. Small businesses simply cannot get quotes. They are being closed down by stealth as a result of not having insurance cover. People cannot get insurance cover for heavy plant machinery such as that used for timber extraction in forestry. Quotes will be offered but of such ridiculous proportions that it is not commercially viable and if it were to be paid the companies would be bankrupt in 12 months. This matter must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with all the contributions that have been made. This issue must be addressed for the sake of young people. I hope it is not lip-service as it would be tragic if that were the case and young people, in particular, would be extremely disappointed in it. It would be a disgrace if nothing was done after the strength of feeling expressed in the House following this report, which was a long time in coming from the MIAB. I am pledging, as I know the Minister of State will, that something will be done about it in the next Dáil where it will be at the top of the agenda. Something will be done for young people in regard to insurance to allow them to get on with their lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the publication of this report. It is one of the most comprehensive reports that has ever come into this House and I very much welcome it. Many young people cannot afford to drive a car because of the insurance costs associated with it. As the last speaker, Deputy Boylan, said, a car is an essential part of life in rural areas. Whether one works ten or 20 miles from home the only means of transport in most cases is the car. In Dublin there is a good bus and train service to get people to and from work, but for those living in rural <Col N="1148" /> areas the only options are to have a motorcycle or a car, and most people prefer to have a car.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the speed limit being adhered to in rural areas. I never got a speeding ticket in my life but I believe that a speed limit of 60 mph is too high for the majority of our county roads. I hope the Minister of State will take this on board. It should not be the same as on our national primary and secondary roads. If we have a speed limit of 30 mph as we approach towns, why do we have a speed limit of 60 mph on county roads? I am not blaming anybody for this. Our county roads are lovely and I do not want to see them changed. Visitors from abroad admire the beautiful scenery and the twists and turns on them.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the amount of compensation that people get when they make a claim. One night when I was a passenger in a car we met two cars stopped on the road waiting to turn right. As we passed the second car someone suddenly ran out from the back of it into the path of the car in which I was. He had been told by the driver of the other car that there was a car approaching yet he ran into the path of the oncoming car. I am not saying that he had alcohol taken but the signs all pointed to that being the case. That individual went to a solicitor and was told to claim and he got a large sum of money even though he was in the wrong, because a car driver is responsible at all times when he is on the road. Some solicitors make a great deal of money because they work on a percentage of what they can get from successful claims and that should not be allowed.</P>
      <P>I will not be back in the House to see the recommendations of this report being implemented but I hope the Acting Chairman and the Minister of State are both back to ensure this happens. There are some aspects of this report, in particular, that I would like to see being implemented. Our young people are among the most responsible in society. They will not take their car on a Saturday night if they intend having a drink and designated drivers are a common practice. We were not as responsible when we were their age, but admittedly there were not as many cars available then.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government are introducing a number of cameras around the country and I hope that process will continue so that those who are speeding will be caught. Recently I was overtaken while driving at 50 mph by two cars which passed out coming into a turn with a double white line on the road. In such places we need to have cameras to catch the culprits because they are a living danger.</P>
      <P>I hope that when an appropriate Bill comes before the House the Minister of State will be there to see it through. This is my last time to speak in the House and it has been a pleasure to work with all Members and the staff of the House.</P>

      <P>I endorse what has been said about Deputy Brennan. He has given legendary and distinctive service to this House representing the great people of Sligo and Leitrim for 20 years. It has been a privilege to have him as a colleague in Parliament and within the parliamentary party. I thank him for his tremendous work and wish himself and his wife and wonderful family every success in the years ahead. I look forward to meeting him on many future occasions, please God, both in this House and outside it.</P>
      <P>I thank all of the Deputies who have spoken so clearly and eloquently on this Bill. I single out the contributions of Deputies Andrew Boylan, Joe Higgins, Batt O'Keeffe, Michael Ring and Mattie Brennan. Their interpretation of the report and sincerity and positive attitude speak volumes for what we could all achieve to best represent the people, irrespective of what the challenge may be.</P>
      <P>Much blame has been attributed to me in recent years in regard to insurance. I was appointed to this job on 9 October 1997. I studied the industry and had consultations with the insurance unit in my Department pertaining to the problems of the insurance industry, and immediately set about addressing them. We decided to proceed with an Insurance Bill which became the Insurance Act, 2000, and created a new transparency and fairness for the consumer. It was a historic breakthrough and the first time it was done and I am pleased to have been part of it. I thank everybody who worked with me to achieve that.</P>
      <P>I have been blamed for what happened in the case of Independent Insurers, a company registered abroad in regard to which no responsibility attached to the legislative authorities in the State or to my Department. Upon the collapse of the company on 17 June 2001, I immediately responded, bringing the Insurance Federation in within 24 hours and saving many companies from going to the wall. We got alternative cover, albeit at a much higher price, and we kept the economy ticking over. Nobody could have foreseen the crisis in the United States and across the world following 11 September, but I dealt with it as best I could, keeping the Dáil, my colleagues and everybody else informed of events as they unfolded. I did my best to save a few companies, one of which I regret went to the wall while a few more were seriously affected. Nobody could blame the Government, me or my Department because we responded instantly on every occasion as the crisis evolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is the most comprehensive ever delivered to the State and what it comes down to is money. This is all to do with financial services and protection and the management of funds in <Col N="1150" /> the interests of people, from whom the money comes. People pay insurance premiums. The average return on premiums paid per motorist during the period of managing those funds, which come in and go out from the companies, averages 3%. There is 103% of capital comprising that which is paid in premiums and the 3% net income added on as a result of interest payments. The report explains where the money goes. The 3% earned in interest on the investment of premiums is paid to the brokers who are the intermediaries who handle the applications, leaving the initial capital of 100%, 50% of which is paid out in compensation, 10% on management expenses and the remaining 40% to the lawyers who professionally manage matters on behalf of litigants. Given where that 40% goes, there were a number of people here today whom I would have thought had a very strong professional interest in those figures, but they did not even refer to them and chose to blame me.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board report contains proposals to improve the quality of justice for seriously injured and genuinely innocent victims of accidents. This will not involve any net cost increase provided the litigation overheads in such cases are tackled to ensure that the money goes to those who need it, not to the legal experts. The reason the MIAB findings differ from those of the Government, my Department and me is because our key responsibility is the supervision of solvency to ensure that companies have capital adequacy to meet their liabilities going forward. The supervision of solvency is an entirely different brief from the question of equity of premium differentials and only a board with statutory power and the force of law behind it could dig into every other aspect of motor insurance, which is a compulsory operation. That is the mandate I gave the MIAB and it did an outstanding job.</P>
    <P>We were accused of doing nothing for five years and of achieving nothing for the people, but there were many there for years before me who did absolutely nothing. I was asked why it took so long for action to be taken. I appointed the board in September 1998 and it has taken since then to force the required raw data out of the insurance companies. It was only last June that we ultimately received those data in usable format. I managed this matter in consultation with the board, the insurance industry and in answer to parliamentary questions and I never flinched from my goal of a report which would be a tool to serve consumers and to provide opportunities for future Governments to address these matters. I am confident that the document is comprehensive and will be of major assistance going forward.</P>
    <P>There was no alternative way to get this information and we can see that by looking at the limited progress made by the Joint Committee which called the Insurance Federation before it. Until all the analyses were completed, it would have been premature to proceed. I sincerely thank the four Deputies opposite who admitted that it <Col N="1151" /> would not have been possible to proceed without the <i>de facto</i> information, which I appreciate very much. I thank them sincerely for their integrity, dignity and honour in accepting that I could not proceed with an interim report which would not stand up in law anywhere. Any decision I took would have been subject to judicial review and would not have stood for a second. I was not prepared to risk the integrity of Government or the Constitution or to pose a threat to the rights of citizens by not having a solid report in front of me. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board made it clear that the 67 recommendations must be addressed in tandem, not piecemeal or <i>à la carte</i>, and we are following that advice. In the IIF press statement of March 2001 following the release of the interim report of June 2000, insurers attacked Deputies for speaking out before the final facts were established. That is a matter of public record. In contrast, the Insurance Federation's statements of the past week welcome the report and its recommendations. This report relates to everybody and everybody accepts it.</P>
    <P>People have asked why the publication date of 31 December 2001 was not met. The initial draft of the final report was drawn up in November 2001, just a few months ago, and the work from then until February 2002 involved securing the Insurance Industry Federation's input and agreeing the text of its dissenting points at various paragraphs. We got the federation to check all the figures in the report and there is now no room for anybody to rubbish the data or the analysis of it, as was attempted after the publication of the interim report.</P>

    <P>We received a quality report and no one has questioned the figures, facts or analysis contained in it. It has been agreed and accepted by all, unlike Deputy Rabbitte's McCauley report which was a legal, minority report and inconclusive. In blaming me for not going ahead with the MIAB report, Deputy Rabbitte is being completely disingenuous. He was not able to get a conclusive report and, upon receipt of a divided document, his alternative was to create McCauley 2. I have <Col N="1152" /> now to deal with that, but he blames me for not doing so. He has attacked me on radio and television, in newspapers and in Parliament. He was a Minister in the area of commerce and though not once in his time in office did he call the previous Motor Insurance Advisory Board of four members together, communicate with or consult them or take action on motor insurance, he still tells me what I did wrong. I say to Deputy Rabbitte that the people will judge my performance and I am quite confident they will find I have done my best at all times in their interests.</P>
    <P>It is clear where we go now. People have referred today to the press conference of ISME and other organisations and I am fully in touch with that matter. I have met these organisations time beyond number over the past five years and given them the best advice on every occasion. I met them last week and gave them solid advice which I am sure they will consider as seriously as possible. I wish them every success with what they propose.</P>
    <P>We mean business. We have produced a report which between the annotated document, the main text and the appendices exceeds 1,000 pages. A high powered implementation group was set up, chaired by the eminent Assistant Secretary of the Department, Mr. Corcoran, including outstanding people such as principal officers in other Departments, representatives from the Consumers' Association, IBEC and the eminent chairperson of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, Dorothea Dowling. They had their first meeting this morning at which they set out a target of work. As a result of a Government decision on 10 April, they have three months from today to report back to me. They were given three months from the inaugural meeting which means they must report back to the next Government within three months from today.</P>
    <P>An outline of the implementation group's work is very simple. They have looked at the recommendations, decided who is responsible, what action needs to be taken and who must take that action, and they are setting a time schedule for the action to be taken. Together with that, they will be asking the insurance industry right across the board to clearly outline the level of reductions in premium costs that would accompany a reduction in legal costs because we got a commitment from the insurance industry in the past that if we abolished juries the cost of insurance would decrease. This Parliament agreed to abolish juries. Following a Government decision, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recommended to Parliament in good faith that that be done but we got no return. On this occasion we want to know what we will get before proceeding to make any further reduction. We intend to proceed very rapidly.</P>
    <P>The implementation group will meet in joint consultation with the Motor Insurance Advisory Board on 2 May to decide how they can maximise their impact together so that there will be rapid performance over the three months ensuring the <Col N="1153" /> next Government will have the most conclusive, impacting situation possible to deliver a fair, equitable, cost-effective and efficient insurance cover to motorists. We have done a huge amount of work. We have set a standard and an opportunity for the next Government and Minister, whoever is in office, to conclude the work. I am confident if we get the full support of Parliament, whoever is elected to the new Dáil, work together and support one another, it will take a great effort to kill the vested interests. Following the McAuley report, we invited the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council to make submissions to us. They said they would provided we told them in writing what we wished to discuss. IBEC, the Consumers' Association or any others who discussed the matter with us did not set preconditions.</P>
    <P>People are now beginning to see there is a serious requirement for people to act honourably and in a consensual way to achieve that which is fair to every citizen irrespective of their age or where they live. We are confident that if Parliament works together and supports the Government of the day, whoever that may be, we can ensure new cost-effective and efficient structures and that systems and opportunities can be delivered for all consumers of insurance, whether motor, personal accident, employers' liability or whatever. If we look at the facts, 40% are the legal fees on the motor side, 46% are the legal fees on the employers' liability side but when poor mother Ireland or the taxpayers of the country are paying out the fees are 56.4%. No one can justify that. We can only win if we in Parliament work together and support one another. No one on their own will win. We must work collectively to support the Government of the day, including the new boards that have been set up, the implementation group and the personal injuries assessment board. If we work together on a solid basis and ensure we take on the vested interests then the people will win through the democratically elected Parliament and the Government that will be in office to do the job in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge, on the record of this House, the terrible tragedy which took place last week when two members of the Garda Síochána were killed by joyriders. I offer my sympathy to the family, friends and neighbours of Garda Padden, a constituent of mine from Shanaghy in Belmullet. I attended the funeral of Garda Padden last week and it was evident the town in north Mayo was devastated by the terrible tragedy.</P>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with expressions of sympathy to the family of Garda Tighe. I have a strong association with the Garda Síochána as my grand-uncle was the first assistant commissioner in the 1920s. I thank the Garda for the wonderful job they do for the people. Many of us are unaware of what they face when they go out at night and we are, at times, very critical of them. They deserve the public's support and deserve to be protected by law.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Labour Party for introducing this Bill. It is important that we put in place legislation to deal with young people who are underage and cannot be prosecuted or made pay for their crimes. Something will have to be done to stop joyriding, though that is not the word we should be using. We should change the title of the Bill in this regard. Young people are stealing high powered vehicles and driving them through one-way systems at high speed resulting in death. We have witnessed the many families left without loved ones as a result of this activity. It is time this House and Parliament put in place the necessary legislation to deal with these people.</P>
      <P>We read reports last week in the media of offenders brought before the courts on 20 or 25 occasions, some awaiting conviction in relation to previous offences. We must put a stop to this. Parents will have to take responsibility for their out of control children and places to detain them will have to be found. If youngsters commit such a crime once they will do it twice or, as we have seen, 20 times. That cannot be allowed to continue. We must enact legislation that will prevent the occurrence of such tragedies.</P>
      <P>I heard recently, on a programme on RTE, people living in housing estates complaining there is no legislation to deal with this activity. These people are unable to allow their children out to play during the day or late in the evening because of the incidence of joyriding. The joyriders are putting at risk their houses and their children. It is, perhaps, because this crime is occurring in working class areas that we have not taken it seriously.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Labour Party has introduced this Bill which, I hope, will be accepted. I hope the necessary legislation to prevent another terrible tragedy will be put in place. It took the tragedy of last week to highlight this issue again. I hope we will not witness the killing of any more people. We must stop the lunacy of young people stealing high powered cars, driving them at high speed throughout the country and putting people's lives at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" />I offer my sympathy to the Garda Síochána who represent us so well. They are the people faced with the task of tackling young people driving high powered cars at high speed. These youngsters do not seem to care about life or law and order. Something has to be done to prevent them putting other people's lives at risk. I am glad this House is at last taking this issue seriously.</P>
    <P>I support the Labour Party Bill and hope the Government will accept it and that the necessary legislation will be put in place to protect our people so they can walk the streets and housing estates without fear. The media should cease calling this activity joyriding. It is not joyriding, it is murder-riding and it must be stopped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Ring in relation to the loss of life of two fine members of the Garda Síochána. I extend my sympathy to the families of both men. It is a shocking tragedy that should not have happened. It is, however, only the most recent tragedy; there have been others. Regrettably, respect for gardaí is, in certain sections of society, dwindling. We must address that issue. The presence of a garda in our community is a source of comfort to elderly people in particular. We must respect the gardaí and appreciate the great work they do. They put their lives at risk for us. It is not good enough that when a garda leaves his home in the morning his wife and young family or his immediate family cannot be sure if he will return. This is a new phenomenon which stems from lack of respect.</P>
      <P>Long ago, people were courteous to a garda on duty in a village or town. We must curtail the activities of the small number of people who disrespect the law. Also, the Judiciary are not doing their job. People often frown when I am critical of the Judiciary. They are not above criticism. They are appointed by the Government and they are failing in their duty. Simply giving a slap on the wrist to people who behave in this manner is not good enough. These young people must be taught a lesson. They are out of control. In many instances judges are helpless as they have no places to detain such people. The Government must accept its responsibility in this area and provide safe places in which to detain these youngsters. I read recently in an article in a newspaper that we are now looking to Northern Ireland as a place of safe keeping for these people. We should not be exporting our young people; we should look after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; gives one a sense that this is a sport and is fun. Rather than fun it is dangerous and can end in murder. This crime must and can be curtailed whether through the installation of surveillance cameras in housing estates or an increase in the number of gardaí on the streets. We must provide the Garda with better equipment to deal with this activity. If the patrol car is not safe they must be provided with <Col N="1156" /> a more secure vehicle, be it a four-wheel drive or a specially designed vehicle. We cannot send them out in flimsy cars which are unable to stand up to the types of activities in which these people are involved. These people have no regard for the car they are driving because it does not belong to them.</P>
    <P>Joyriding is not a major problem in Cavan but it is beginning to creep in. We must stamp out this activity. The nonsense which prevails in my court district of the judge providing a poor box at the back of the court into which these youngsters are required to pay &euro;30 on leaving the court must be stopped. I understand that when such a penalty is imposed there is no record involved. When that young person is brought back to court on another conviction it is treated as a first offence because the previous offence is not registered. I know of young people who when brought to court and given a fine of &euro;30 asked the garda involved if they could borrow the money from him to pay the fine. They were not in the least bit worried. The judge then awarded them ten days to pay. They only needed 24 hours because that night they broke into a house and stole the money. They were caught and fined again. That is the type of nonsense that is taking place. Let us deal with this issue. We must prevent it from happening and lock away those involved. We must also train these people while they are locked up.</P>
    <P>I thank the Labour Party for the opportunity to make those few brief comments. In particular I sympathise with the Garda Síochána and the families of those who lost their lives. I avail of this opportunity to put on record my admiration for the great done being done by the Garda and I hope it will always have the support of the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Kelleher, Kitt and Lenihan. This is the third time the Labour Party has tabled a Bill or motion dealing with this topic in the past few years. This time it is being done on the back of the terrible accident last week. As others have done, I convey my sympathy to the families of Garda Tighe and Garda Padden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two different issues. The last two speakers referred to the terrible tragedy although the Bill deals with a different issue altogether. However, it is a reasonable opportunity to talk about it, particularly from the Labour Party point of view. While the Labour Party has had a go at this on three occasions it has been shot down each time because the Bill is deficient. We cannot deny there is a problem. The question is whether the Bill is a solution or whether it helps along the way. In the ten days since that terrible accident much has been said about crime. Suddenly crime is almost the central issue in the country yet it seems a new issue to the Labour Party which did not mention it in its little pledge card which it issued some weeks ago. Obviously people such as Deputy Broughan may have had an input into the card, but if so nobody was listening because this lovely sexy little card, which contains all sorts of <Col N="1157" /> politically correct stuff, has not a dicky bird about joyriding or crime of any sort whatsoever. We all have problems and one must sympathise with Deputy Broughan. Depending on the constituency from which we come we chip away at highlighting what we see as major problems. Had Deputy Broughan been listened to there would have been some mention if not of joyriding&mdash;</P>

      <P>To be fair to Deputy Broughan, he is chipping away at a very real problem. The cars involved in that terrible accident were worth £40,000 and were stolen from nice areas of the city. That is a matter for the Garda. There is a great deal of legislation in that area. This Bill is not about the terrible accident last week but about cars which have reached the end of their lives. There is a problem. Some of the speech from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, last night was theoretical. Not only did Deputy Broughan fail to get the message across but I failed to get the message across. The Minister suggested there might be a bit of a problem with end-of-life vehicles. It is more than a bit of a problem &ndash; in certain constituencies it is a huge problem. While the general objections to the deficiencies in the Bill may be valid the Minister's response was theoretical. It appears that thinking in the Department has not moved on.</P>

      <P>There is a major problem involving children and it was probably at its peak when the national car test was introduced about 18 months to two years ago. While the position is not quite as bad now the problem has not gone away. It is all right to say the Garda has power and we rush in here with legislation every time there is a problem. Legislation is not always the answer. We have lashings of legislation, what is needed is somebody to implement it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Occasionally the Garda stops a 14 year old <Col N="1158" /> driving a banger bought from Travellers. If some of the officials dealing with this issue in the Department were to visit some of our constituencies &ndash; through the Minister I invited them to visit Dunsink Lane in my constituency &ndash; they would see the realities of life and the deficiencies in legislation and it would take the theory out of some of these issues. The Garda has the power to take a car from a 14 year old whom he sees driving around, but there is nowhere to put such cars. Changes are needed in the legislation to allow the Garda scrap a banger after seven days. It is acceptable to keep a 01-D car for three or six months until the owner is found but for a banger of six to ten years old there should be a sliding scale which would allow these vehicles to be crushed after seven or 14 days. In any event most of them are abandoned. The Garda will not take in those vehicles because it has nowhere to put them. It has a big compound in my constituency into which all kinds of cars are put. The Garda will tell one informally that it could fill the compound ten times over but it will not. If it takes them in, it has to keep them for anything up to three months. That period might be valid for a good car but not for a banger.</P>
    <P>I thought progress was being made in regard to the end-of-life measure. A voluntary industry-led measure will get nowhere. At present the industry is involved in end-of-life certificates where one deregisters a car. There is such leakage from the industry through all forms of back lanes and Travellers that it cannot work. A voluntary industry led project is no good. The only way to solve it, and I thought that was the way we were proceeding, is to charge &euro;200 extra VRT on the purchase price of a car which could be recouped when it receives an end-of-life certificate and is taken to the scrapyard. Perhaps the amount should be more than &euro;200. The only way to solve the problem is to have a charge at the beginning and a refund at the end. There is an enormous problem on the fringes of the city, where city meets country, in working class suburbs and it has to be tackled. This is totally separate from the taking of expensive cars which are capable of travelling at speed.</P>
    <P>This Bill may not be the solution to the problem but it offers an opportunity to again highlight the issue and it has to be grappled with. While a banger may not be capable of travelling at 140 miles per hour on a motorway it is still a lethal vehicle and can do much damage. This problem was at its peak 18 months to two years ago but it will not go away. There is always an accident waiting to happen. I hope the Department will bring forward an end-of-life measure.</P>

      <P>I extend my deepest sympathy to the families of the two gardaí who were tragically killed last week and to the force. This Bill is about dealing with company cars which is a huge problem, particularly in large urban areas. Many of these cars are purchased for small sums of money and driven at high speed and, more than likely, taken to a field and burned out. That is happening wholesale in certain constituencies and it is time it was addressed. There is also the issue of joyriding and whether it involves a company car which was bought for £100 or a stolen car the fact is that the people in those cars are a huge threat to life and limb. In Cork there have been tragic cases of people having been mowed down and killed by joyriders, and joyriders themselves, some as young as 13 years of age, have also lost their lives. We face a major challenge in tackling this problem and we must do so from two directions. Any person who steals a car and drives it at high speed, whether in an urban or rural area, should be treated severely when brought before a court. Excuses have been made in recent years as to why these people are driving stolen cars at high speed, but that is not good enough. We must show that we are serious about tackling this problem and sentences imposed for such an offence must be stiff. If people are convicted of committing this very serious crime, proper rehabilitation measures should be in place for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is currently happening is unacceptable. When offenders are released on probation they will steal again and probably cause harm to themselves, passengers in the car they have stolen or a pedestrian. They may eventually be given a custodial sentence, but there are no rehabilitation measures in place and they are back on the streets in three or four months' time. Gardaí say that the minute they get a telephone call from a prison officer informing them that a certain individual is being let out of jail, they know that within days the joyriding incidents will start up again. The ringleader comes out, the pals are back and they are on the road again. This is unacceptable. I do not know whether it is due to the revolving door syndrome, but the necessary <Col N="1160" /> rehabilitation facilities are not in place to wean such offenders off this activity.</P>
    <P>Joyriding is a problem in society and much of it is due to dysfunctional family backgrounds where, to say the least, parental guidance is not the best. That area also needs to be addressed. Is a 14 year old who drives a car at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. attending school? Is such young person's school attendance checked? There should be a central attendance roll, which would highlight when young persons are not attending school and in such cases someone could call to the home and check what is happening there.</P>
    <P>The mention of imposing a curfew would send a shiver down people's spines because they would perceive it to be an infringement on their liberty. It is time we considered the imposition of a curfew as a measure to be used in tackling this problem. If an individual is brought before the courts for a public order offence or a more minor offence that does not carry a custodial sentence, I do not see anything wrong in placing a curfew on that individual to require him or her to be indoors at certain times. If the individual is under a certain age, he or she could attend school and go to games, but should be required to be indoors during the hours of darkness. If the individual is older, he or she could attend work and then be required to be indoors. The imposition of a curfew to tackle this problem should be considered seriously. Such a curfew would not infringe society's rights which we are trying to protect.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some individuals in society are causing mayhem, whether they are driving stolen cars at high speed through estates instilling terror and fear in people or causing a great nuisance by committing public order offences. An enforcement officer could be assigned to the larger Garda stations and available technology could be used to tag individuals to a bleep system to ensure they are in a certain area, say, their homes. Such a system is used in other countries and we should seriously consider using it here. The necessary technology is available. If the political will existed to use it, such a system would be a very effective way to force such individuals to confront their problems and, if they were placed under a curfew and breached it, such an offence should carry a stiffer penalty.</P>
    <P>Some company cars are being sold for &euro;100 because it costs money to scrap them in order to comply with environmental policy. The oil would have to be taken out of car, the battery disposed of and the tyres taken off. Such cars are advertised for sale and a contact mobile telephone number is given. A young person can buy such a car for &euro;100, the seller may fill it with petrol and the young person can drive off in it immediately. We must put a stop to that mechanism of young people purchasing company cars. The next Government will have to seriously examine this practice which enables many of these young people to buy cars. Some people would argue that if these young people cannot buy these cars, they will steal cars. We should try to cut off every <Col N="1161" /> source from which these young people can get cars. The alarms and advanced technology in modern cars make them difficult to steal and these young people are being forced to use company cars.</P>
    <P>There have been tragic cases in Cork. It is time we confronted the problem of joyriding. When a tragedy happens it is call death-riding. We have lost too many young people through this activity. Young people from where I come do not seem to learn from the mistakes of their peers or older siblings. This problem is being continually perpetrated by a small number of offenders. If such offenders are given a custodial sentence, they should also have access to rehabilitation to ensure they are weaned off this activity rather than being let out, having spent three months in Rathmore Road, and the first thing they do is head for a car.</P>
    <P>We face a challenge in tackling this problem. The debate on this Bill is an opportunity to speak on this issue, even though the Bill really seeks to address the problem posed by the availability of company cars. Irrespective of whoever is in the next Government, this matter should be a priority. Such offenders should have access to rehabilitation and more severe sentences should be imposed.</P>

      <P>I admire the Deputy's persistence, but in the Labour Party we are seeing more and more of the triumph of image over substance, the image of being seen to do something in this Chamber and the expression of outrage in the media about the crime problem in order to garner votes. I do not believe this to be true of Deputy Broughan, but there is a perception among the public that the Labour Party has gone corporate and is no longer interested in representing the ordinary people on the ground. That was evidenced by the defection of councillor Michael Billane to our party in the past week or so.</P>

      <P>The important point in debating this Bill is that we must get to grips with <Col N="1162" /> addressing the highly dysfunctional situation of a number of young persistent offenders. That is the nub of tackling the problem of joyriding and crime in this city. A dysfunctional group of young people, generally males, are committing most criminal offences. We saw that in relation to a number of high profile cases recently where offenders had been in and out of prison for offences, some numbering 20, prior to their most recent offence. This is a serious problem, but it is one that is being addressed by the Government.</P>

      <P>There is a disturbing trend in modern Ireland, particularly because of prosperity, in that much more money is floating around and youngsters have more money for all sorts of anti-social activity. They are drinking far more than a previous generation who did not have the same resources. That is a serious problem, but it is one for which the Government cannot legislate. We cannot legislate as a House for good parenting and the idea that we could is, to my mind, ridiculous.</P>

      <P>We must have some level of intervention. We can have a social policy that is directed at radical intervention to prevent the neglect that is giving rise to these problems but one cannot legislate for good parenting. Good parenting comes from a proper upbringing, proper material resources for a family and social support at a level that helps the family in difficulty or which needs assistance from the State. Those are the essential planks of this Government &ndash; increasing social welfare and the levels of intervention. The Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="1163" /> Law Reform referred to this when talking about the RAPID programme being rolled out in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country, including some parts of my constituency. There are also 13 drug task forces, which means targeted intervention for those communities most in need&mdash;</P>

I was on the same programme with them analysing a poll in the constituency and what concerned me most about their interventions was that in dramatising the crime problem &ndash; Deputy Rabbitte is very strong on the microphone side of political life &ndash; he was running down his own constituency. I stress that very carefully. He caused grave annoyance and at least 100 constituents rang my office about it. They were furious that Deputies Rabbitte and Hayes highlighted a stereotypical view of the Tallaght area which is not in accordance with the facts.</P>

      <P>I join in expressions of sympathy to the two gardaí who lost their lives in the so-called joyriding accident last week. There are some good points in this Bill and I congratulate Deputy Broughan for bringing it back to us. Every radio programme has discussed this issue in the past week and it is important we debate it. However, producing legislation for the sake of it is not the answer. We should have practical proposals and a comprehensive package of measures to deal with many of these anti-social problems. We should not be seen to be just doing something. My yardstick for measures we should take is to ask if the Garda needs new powers and it <Col N="1164" /> has not said it needs them. Will the legislation provide the Garda with additional enforceable measures to tackle the problem?</P>
      <P>I will give the perspective of small rural towns on this matter. Many anti-social issues are now appearing in such areas. I said in the debate on motor insurance that we should use the transition year in schools for discussing the responsibilities of drivers and for education programmes in relation to advertising campaigns and the courtesy needed from those buying or renting cars. That is very important. People say some of the advertising campaigns are very graphic but that is necessary to drive home the message that one cannot allow speeding or drink driving. The necessity of wearing seat belts must also be stressed. We are all familiar with the slogan &ldquo;Speed kills&rdquo; and so-called joyriding is all about irresponsible driving.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government made the point that not all the cars involved are stolen. Old cars and end-of-life vehicles are also available and are being used by young people in urban areas. What is the status of the EU directive on end-of-life vehicles? I understood that directive would ensure that all end-of-life vehicles would be collected, dismantled and recovered by the industry at no cost to the final owner of the vehicle. I am inundated with requests from tidy town committees in east Galway about these old vehicles which are dumped in towns and become eyesores while these hard-working committees are trying to improve the grading of their towns in this prestigious competition. The Garda should take stronger action on this issue. It can impound stolen or old cars if necessary. Those under 16 are prohibited from holding driving licences and there are other offences under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, such as driving in a public place without insurance. Fines for such offences have been increased to &euro;2,500. The legislation is in place.</P>
      <P>The Chair has often spoken about having more gardaí on the ground. The Government has increased the number of gardaí and the Taoiseach recently said at our Árd Fheis that our party is committed to recruiting an extra 2,000 gardaí. We need the extra personnel on the street because the Garda has made it clear that many of its members are retiring while other gardaí must do different work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to transition year, which is a useful and innovative year in second level schools. Anti-social behaviour must also be examined and improving young people's self-esteem is part of that. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government referred to the RAPID programme and mentioned the need to promote social inclusion. In Galway, Ballinasloe, Tuam and parts of Galway city are included in the programme, which shows there have been failings in education facilities and housing and health services in these areas. I hope the RAPID programme is applied quickly to these areas &ndash; for example, the provision of a community hospital in Tuam is one <Col N="1165" /> aspect of the programme I hope will receive priority. The education programmes I want to see should be focused on the primary school level. Issues such as seat belts and drunk driving are as important as speeding.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform referred to the shortage of remand accommodation for young offenders and said he had Government approval for the provision of additional accommodation, which is welcome. The courts should also be guaranteed that a small number of serious offenders can be detained. In some estates speed ramps and other control measures have been provided with the agreement of local residents, while traffic calming measures have been introduced in smaller towns. These measures need to be extended further, as traffic control measures have been very useful to the Garda as checkpoints. CCTV is also very useful in detecting crime, particularly street violence. I welcome the fact that the Government is providing CCTV systems for 17 towns and that grants are available for communities who wish to install local systems.</P>
    <P>This Bill is flawed in terms of road traffic legislation, but I compliment Deputy Broughan. Hopefully, we will have a more comprehensive package of measures to deal with so-called joyriding and other anti-social problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies O'Sullivan, Shortall and O'Shea.</P>
      <P>It has taken the tragic deaths of two gardaí in the course of their duty last weekend to again focus attention on the plague of stolen cars and the young men who drive them recklessly. In reality this plague is a nightly phenomenon in many parts of the city, particularly in disadvantaged and deprived areas. It is not acceptable that two men whose mission was to protect the public should be the victims of these reckless and irresponsible activities.</P>
      <P>This debate is not about so-called joyriding, but about the Government's failure to deal with a serious social problem of which all Members are aware. In deference to Deputy Conor Lenihan, this is not an instant response to the events of two weeks ago. Deputy Broughan raised this issue two years ago and tabled a road traffic Bill which proposed to make it an offence to take and drive a car in a public place in a manner which is dangerous to the public. The Bill also aimed to deal with the problem of so-called company cars. Various penalties were proposed and a substantial set of recommendations were made to deal with the underlying causes of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to comprehend the Government's priorities when, in the dying hours of the 28th Dáil, it considers the building of a white elephant sports stadium to be a matter of serious debate. It is important that penalties are imposed and that the perpetrators of crime are not allowed to roam our streets instilling fear and terror. However, it is even more important that the fundamental reasons for their anti-social and reckless <Col N="1166" /> behaviour are acknowledged and addressed. That is why it is obscene that a monument is being promoted which will have no impact on the quality of life or the opportunities for those who steal cars and drive them recklessly.</P>
    <P>In some parts of my constituency the dangerous driving of stolen cars is a regular event. Law abiding people live in fear and terror because of such activities. However, the gangs of youths who engage in such activities will never get a chance to see the inside of Stadium Ireland if it is ever built. They might have some hope of getting involved in a football team or a swimming club if they had a football pitch or a swimming pool near them.</P>
    <P>In large tracts of my constituency there is no community centre. It is not acceptable that the services and facilities which might make a difference have to be competed for and, very often, fail to materialise. It is outrageous that schools in areas which are designated as disadvantaged have to struggle to get resource teachers and psychologists. The clichéd gap between rich and poor is alive and well and is providing an excellent breeding ground for those who are already at risk to acquire all the characteristics of the next generation of no-hopers.</P>
    <P>There are some simple, practical steps which can be taken to alleviate this. Company cars can be removed and disposed of. The maximum legal speed limit is 70 mph, yet cars which can be driven at 140 mph or 150 mph are available. These cars can be disabled or adapted to operate near the 70 mph limit. A dedicated Garda corps could be introduced to deal specifically with stolen cars which are driven recklessly and youth services and facilities could be given a priority rating for those in need.</P>
    <P>I have made every effort to avoid using the word &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; as it is inappropriate. However, it is the only word available to describe an irresponsible and reckless activity. Hopefully, I have put forward proposals for penalties which are important. However, more importantly I have proposed facilities to underpin and address the opportunities which should be given to those most in need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Government parties will support this Bill which they rejected in the past. There is a need for practical support for the Garda. It is inconceivable that we will not give the force whatever supports it needs, including strong and effective legislation such as this which can address some of the specific problems faced by communities.</P>
      <P>Neither Deputy Upton nor I wish to use the word &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; as &ldquo;deathriding&rdquo; is probably more appropriate. Deputy Broughan's Bill proposes a practical means to address this issue in legislation. I do not know how the Government parties can fail to support the Bill if they are serious about addressing the issue of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda needs a framework of support which should include legislation such as this. It <Col N="1167" /> should also include the resources, equipment and manpower which the force needs to take on these small groups of young people who are virtually waging a reign of terror on their communities. These people seem to have no regard for their lives or those of others.</P>
    <P>The gardaí also need to be sure that places of detention are available for those convicted of crimes so they are kept off the streets. There seems to be no deterrent against this destructive behaviour which is not just anti-social but, as we saw last week, is also anti-life. There is a need for a crisis response, particularly regarding the shortage of places of detention for young offenders. It makes a mockery of the work of the Garda when offenders are released to reoffend simply because there is no place to put them.</P>
    <P>With my colleagues, I am dealing with a case in Limerick involving a young person who has been put in a place of detention, but who is released every weekend to prey on his community. He is then taken back for the week and let out again the following weekend. This is not effective and does not protect the communities about which we are talking from what is happening.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting in another community in Limerick last week at which the main topic was how to produce bollards in a residential estate which would be strong enough to combat the ramming of cars by so-called joyriders. This is not just a problem for Dublin, but for urban centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This problem can be tackled if there is a determined effort. It requires effective legislation and sufficient places of detention. It is disgraceful at this stage of the Celtic tiger that we do not have places to lock up young offenders who have been found guilty and who have been terrorising their communities, yet judges have to let them go because there is nowhere to put them. As was evident from the case last week, people who are locked up and who have committed a number of offences have to be let out to make room for new offenders. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable to communities to whom we speak that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can tell the House that the level of crime is decreasing. Crime is the biggest issue for people in this election and they find it incredible that the Government is suggesting that the figures are decreasing. As a public representative I also find that suggestion incredible.</P>
    <P>The public wants a determined response to this issue. People do not wish to see Members just talking about this issue, they want a real response in their communities. This is not just about legislation, manpower and places of detention. It is also about providing measures which ensure that more young people will not grow up to carry out this kind of anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall will have more to say regarding education. However, figures released this <Col N="1168" /> week suggest that 3,400 young people drop out of school every year with no qualifications. In many cases these people do not have the basic backup they need when in school. There is a shortage of psychologists and places in special schools for children who do not get places in regular schools. A school in my constituency does excellent work, but it has to turn away young people every year because it does not have enough places.</P>
    <P>Another young person came to my clinic last week with his mother. He has been two years out of school. He left primary school, did not get a place in secondary school and now two years later he is still out of school. These issues can be tackled when there is money in the economy, as there is now. It is a shame on our community that we have young people like this who do not have an appropriate educational system that can respond to their needs. It is inevitable that the younger brothers of the current criminals in that age group will probably end up offending also unless there is intervention at an earlier stage. In most communities it would be very easy to predict the young people who will end up in these situations. Educationalists know what kind of intervention is needed. Community leaders also know what is needed yet that intervention is not provided.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government parties will be in a position to support this measure. It is just one of the things that needs to be done. It would strengthen the hands of the Garda in situations where young people are driving with no concern for the lives of others around them with, as we saw last week, horrifying results. I understand that indications have been given that this support will not come but even at this late stage I request that consideration be given to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange and cynical for a number of Government backbenchers to agree with the sentiments and intent of Deputy Broughan's Bill when at 8.30 p.m. they are unlikely to support these measures and will troop like sheep behind their Ministers into the lobbies to vote down this legislation for the second time. They know from first-hand experience in their constituencies that this is a serious problem that needs urgent attention and with bleeding hearts they talk about how bad it is. I hope their constituents are aware of their cynical actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragic deaths of the two gardaí last Sunday week have focused attention on this problem. It is a disgrace that it has taken those deaths to bring that attention to bear. This is not a new or isolated problem. Many of us who represent urban communities have lived with this problem for many years. There are large numbers of our constituents living in communities under constant siege from out of control young people running riot in their local communities. Most public meetings in our constitutencies focus at some point on the issue of juvenile offenders. It is the big issue in urban areas. People feel threatened by it and it is the main cause of concern. Other concerns <Col N="1169" /> are the problems of living in fear in a flat or house because of the regularity of joyriding in the community, people being afraid to go out at night for fear of being knocked down or caught up in an accident and people afraid to let their children out to play, even in the afternoon, for fear they will be mown down by a joyrider. These are aspects of the problem of young people out of control.</P>
    <P>Another problem throughout the country is excessive under age drinking. We have an appalling attitude to under age drinking and a huge tolerance of drink in our society. The legislation that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, boasted so much about when he introduced it in July 2000 is not being enforced. Now 18 months after that legislation was introduced not a single pub in the Dublin area has been closed for selling drink to under age persons. We know that, throughout Dublin in particular, there is a massive problem of under age drinking. There seems to be no difficulty with supply either from pubs or off-licences. The political will is not there to tackle the problem. That seems not entirely divorced from the political muscle that many of the publicans in the greater Dublin area seem to have.</P>
    <P>The intimidation and threatening actions young offenders get involved in are another problem. People in a community who are different in any way, for example, a quiet child, a family with darker skin than the rest of us, a gay person, or a person with a disability, are seen as targets because they are seen to be weaker. They are subject to extraordinary abuse from gangs of young people in local communities. Is the Minister aware of this? Deputy Rabbitte made the point earlier that because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is from a rural area there is a problem with his understanding and appreciation of the type of problems we have in urban areas.</P>
    <P>It is hard to over estimate the scale of community crime. I do not mean organised crime but general lawlessness. There is a general breakdown in many communities and they become no-go areas. The Garda are then faced with a situation they find impossible to police. They are under resourced and the community Garda service is being run down for the sake of setting up special units. We no longer have the kind of community Garda service which works at community level and deals with these young people. If zero tolerance is to have any meaning it must be about picking up on youngsters when they first get involved in crime.</P>
    <P>That area has been utterly neglected. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science. Last week, when he was in here being questioned about his stewardship of the juvenile justice system we saw that he did not know what he was talking about. He was rooting helplessly through his files trying to find answers and did not know what the situation was. He did not know how many places there were or how many <Col N="1170" /> had been lost over recent years. He was not in control of the situation. The responsibility for dealing with juvenile crime rightly falls to the Minister for Education and Science. It should be an education response that is provided to young offenders. By and large these are people who have been failed by our education system because of its two-tier nature. The lack of action by Deputy Woods shows he is incapable of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Company cars are another major cause of concern. There is a supplier in my constituency who has been operating from Dunsink Lane in Finglas for the last nine or ten years. In recent years since the national car test came in increasing numbers of people who knew their car would not pass their test, or who failed the test, just dumped their cars. The Garda take several abandoned cars every week off the M50. There is no follow up despite the fact that the legal responsibility is on the last owner of the car to report to the motor tax office. Cars are being abandoned or sold on for a few bob to scrap merchants.</P>
    <P>The scrap merchant operating in Dunsink Lane has been supplying most of the youngsters engaged in driving company cars on the north side of Dublin for the last number of years. No action has been taken against him by the Garda or by Fingal County Council. The majority of youngsters buying company cars chip in a few bob and go along to this dealer and get a clapped out car for &euro;30 or &euro;40. They then take that car off for a cheap night's entertainment. They will drive it around their community at speed and it is just too bad if someone gets in their way. They will drive it until it is out of petrol, possibly crash it into somebody's front garden and then set it alight.</P>
    <P>That is the nightly reality for many communities in urban Ireland and this intolerable situation has been allowed to continue by the current Minister, who has completely neglected the whole area of company cars and stolen cars being driven at speed.</P>
    <P>The Government's record in the area of the juvenile justice system is an absolute disgrace. The Children Act, which had passed Second Stage in 1997, was dropped by this Government and sat on for four years. I asked about it on a monthly basis &ndash; the Taoiseach knew nothing about it, nor did the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science. Finally, last year, a Bill was produced. It was passed through all Stages but it is yet to be commenced. Not a single section of that Act has been commenced and all we have had is lip service to the area of juvenile justice. Non-school attendance is obviously one of the first indications that there are problems in a child's life, yet we have a skeleton school attendance service and most of the country has no service at all. We were told this would be dealt with in the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999. This Bill passed all Stages in this House three years ago and not a single additional school attendance officer has been appointed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" />The record is abysmal. The number of detention places for young people is now smaller than it was five years ago. Many of those centres are in absolute chaos. There are increasing numbers of out-of-control young people living chaotic lives. If they are lucky they will be placed in detention centres which are likely to be just as chaotic as the lives they have left. The Government's record in this regard is a disgrace. It has failed many children in this community and it has failed the communities which are subjected to their joyriding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Broughan, on bringing in the Road Traffic (Joyriding) Bill, 2002, before the Dáil for the second time. Unfortunately, all indications are that this very important and worthwhile Bill will be voted down by the Government for the second time in the lifetime of this Dáil. Before I deal with the substance of the Bill I intend to draw the attention of the House to two recommendations in the recent report on the motor insurance industry. The second recommendation says the current system of unsupervised driving by provisional licence holders should be reviewed and that consideration should be given to the introduction of a road safety and driver education syllabus in schools. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, which looked at the motor insurance industry, adopted a hard financial approach rather than a humane one on the issue of accident trends but the introduction of such a syllabus in our schools would have important spin-off effects, not least the prevention strategy of educating potential joyriders within the system about the grave danger to themselves and to others that arises from reckless driving and excessive speeds. I am not suggesting that the introduction of such a syllabus would be any more than half a solution to the problem of joyriding but there is something to be said for the idea.</P>
      <P>The Bill introduced by Deputy Broughan is effectively a fire-brigade measure, albeit a very effective and appropriate one. The prevention agenda, however, must emanate from the Department of Education and Science so it cannot be part of this Bill. The other recommendation of the MIAB which is relevant to our discussion is No. 37, which says that the Road Traffic Acts and other relevant legislation should be amended to facilitate the full adoption of articles of various EU directives on harmonisation of compulsory motor insurance so that the rights of victims may be clearly upheld under European law in accidents involving uninsured, untraced, defectively or allegedly defectively insured vehicles or drivers. The rest is not relevant here. The issue on which we must focus is the rights of victims because this practice of joyriding has many victims and many different kinds of victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague Deputy Shortall placed the focus on a very important aspect of the discussion, which is the issue of parenting. It is not only <Col N="1172" /> important in relation to joyriding but also in relation to teenage drinking. There is frankly nobody in this Government who convinces me that any serious strategy is emerging in terms of dealing with the problems of under age drinking, violence on our streets and the fact that more and more children are becoming part of this culture. Nobody can argue that introducing a measure such as Deputy Broughan's is not sensible or that it is not workable. Whatever kind of obstinacy is emanating from the other side of the House, the fact that this Bill is being opposed is sending out the wrong signals. Since the recent terrible tragedy to which other speakers have alluded and which I do not want to bring up again, there has been a need to send out signals from this House that we understand what is happening and that we are prepared to come up with measures to deal with what is happening.</P>
    <P>This Bill effectively seeks to introduce two new driving offences to do with supplying, or organising the supply of vehicles to under age people, meaning people of 16 and under. Obviously it does not address in full the issue of stealing vehicles: this is dealt with under other legislation. However, the reason this legislation is so utterly important is the issue of company cars, which was so ably described by my colleague Deputy Shortall. In God's name, what can one say about an Oireachtas which refuses legislation to deal effectively with this horror in our society? Adults are supplying cars to these young people so that they can career around the streets in a most dangerous and reckless fashion, putting many people's lives at risk. This is just unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The issue was adequately dealt with by Deputy Broughan here previously and the Bill has only resurfaced against the background of the current events. This bankrupt Government could very well have considered emergency legislation in this area and it did not. A Bill is offered by the Labour Party which could effectively deal with the problem, but for the Government's own reasons &ndash; to an extent, reasons of electioneering &ndash; the Bill will not be accepted. The principle of the Bill is sound: if the Government wishes to make changes to it I have no doubt that Deputy Broughan would be very receptive to any amendments which would improve the Bill. It is a sad and sorry fact that on this day, probably the second last day of this Dáil, there is a huge problem out there to which the Labour Party is offering a solution, but the Government says it does not want it. Whatever else the Government claims about this &ldquo;golden age&rdquo;&ndash; I am afraid the gold of which the Government speaks is fool's gold &ndash; violence is increasing in our society. Public order incidents are increasing all over the place. It is about time that these issues were addressed.</P>
    <P>This is the great legacy of the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of which the Taoiseach spoke this morning &ndash; a more violent society, more children out of control, the phenomenon of joyriding. What do we have? The fact the Government is not seeking to <Col N="1173" /> address these problems is borne out by its reluctance to assent to this simple and appropriate Bill. The &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; may be a reality for certain sectors of society, but the quality of life of those living in cities has diminished in the last five years. They no longer feel that their homes are secure or that the streets are safe. Society has become more violent and many citizens drink too much. Sporting success, for example, is all too often associated with drinking. We are sending the wrong message to our young people.</P>
    <P>Despite these problems, however, the Taoiseach said today that he feels we are living in a &ldquo;golden age&rdquo;. I do not wish to refer to matters which do not relate to this Bill to support my contention that we do not live in such an age, but it has been a bad five years for the quality of life and security of the people. I cannot see what is golden about this era in those respects. The Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, is a decent man who is concerned about these issues. At this late stage of its life, I call on the Government to demonstrate a commitment to rectifying the social ills I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members of the House agree that joyriding is a deplorable activity that causes destruction and fear and that a multi-agency approach is required if we are to stop it. Last night, the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform outlined the strong measures being taken by this Government, which recognises that all anti-social behaviour must be tackled.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that better management of public housing can make a significant contribution to addressing anti-social behaviour on local authority housing estates and flat complexes. While local authorities are responsible for the management and maintenance of rented dwellings, my Department plays an important role in supporting and guiding them in their efforts to better manage estates. I am pleased that the housing management initiative grant scheme, operated by my Department, has been particularly successful in this regard. Since 1997 over 130 projects have been approved under the scheme, representing a total grant allocation of almost &euro;2.5 million. The vast majority of these projects relate to staffing, estate management programmes and staff and tenant training. In 2001, &euro;200,000 was allocated to three local authorities for the appointment of specialist housing staff to deal with anti-social behaviour and this year my Department's overall grant allocation for these purposes is &euro;2 million. Officials from my Department recently met officials from the major local authorities to discuss anti-social behaviour in local authority estates and were informed that proposals for grant assistance in this area would be particularly welcome under the 2002 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, Deputy Coveney suggested that we need to speed up the length of time it takes to <Col N="1174" /> get a conviction in the courts. I remind him that the penalty points system, which was provided for in the Road Traffic Act, 2002, is designed to act primarily on an administrative basis. The system will apply to 69 offences, some of which are directly related to the joyriding phenomenon. Driving disqualifications arising from the accumulation of 12 penalty points will be notified administratively through a computerised system co-ordinated by my Department. The penalty points system has been developed against the background of the provision in the Constitution relating to the administration of justice. It is not aimed at imposing penalties or disqualifying drivers, but at improving the behaviour of those who recurrently breach traffic laws relating to safety. The system incorporates a significant deterrent: the imposition of an automatic disqualification where a person reaches a defined threshold of points.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy so she should keep her mouth shut. While the Bill we are debating may be supported by the best of motives, it will be of no benefit in addressing the issue it seeks to target. Car theft is adequately addressed in the criminal justice code of the Road Traffic Acts. The Bill would create offences relating to the supply of vehicles that would be impossible to prove. I am familiar with the difficulties caused by joyriding and the incident in which Garda Brian Shanahan was injured last weekend occurred in my constituency. The north side of Cork city suffers from the problem of joyriding in the same way that areas of Dublin and other cities have suffered. As my colleagues pointed out last night, the Bill brought forward by Deputy Broughan is not a solution to the problems created by joyriding. Enforcement of the laws that impact directly on the issue offers the best means of tackling this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies from all parties who contributed to this Second Stage debate tonight and last night. On the weekend before last, we all felt a profound horror as a result of the deaths of Garda Tony Tighe and Garda Michael Padden. I sympathise with their families and colleagues on behalf of the Labour Party. <Col N="1175" /> The terrible incident ten days ago reminds us of the risks taken by gardaí on the streets of our cities each night as they attempt to combat car related crime. It is outrageous, therefore, that two senior Ministers said in this House last night that the resources and legal powers available to the Garda are entirely adequate. After five years, many gardaí feel that additional legal powers and physical resources should have been provided in certain significant areas. It has been reported in the newspapers that a senior garda said that new legal powers are needed in relation to company cars and the gift or sale of cars to youngsters, yet the Ministers said last night that new legal powers are not necessary.</P>
      <P>It was striking to hear a succession of Fianna Fáil Deputies criticise the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform earlier tonight. Deputy Noel Ahern referred to last night's speech by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, as a bit &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo;, but the view on the Labour benches is that after five years, the Minister is more than &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo;. He has not produced a single major development in relation to any of the problems in his Department's remit. Deputy Ahern commented on the Minister's reference to company cars as &ldquo;a bit of problem&rdquo;. As Deputy Gilmore has said on many occasions from these benches, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is completely out of touch with reality. The Minister listed the legal powers under the Road Traffic Acts, including sections 31, 56 and 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which deal with insurance, taxation and the seizure of a vehicle. If these measures were appropriate, cars would be stopped and those selling them would be prevented from entering deprived and disadvantaged areas. It seems clear that there is a lacuna in the legal powers which are available to gardaí in relation to joyriding, an activity which does not exist as a crime in our legal code.</P>
      <P>If the contribution of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government was typically theoretical and short on facts and realities, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's contribution was in the realms of fantasy. He referred to the availability of stinger devices for use by the Garda, but we know that such devices are available to only one in three Garda cars. I have a high regard for the genial Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, but the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, told us a pack of lies, in effect, last night when he said stingers were available to Garda cars throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that term, but the Deputy from Cahirciveen is somebody who misuses the truth. Last night, he brazened his way through the operational details of the Garda <Col N="1176" /> Síochána, knowing full well that in his five years he did not provide the Garda with resources to address this problem. One of the most ludicrous part of the Minister's speech was his reference to remand accommodation. He said he was making plans &ndash; on the night before the Dáil will be dissolved &ndash; to increase the number of places for the young tearaways who caused the death of gardaí and 20 of our citizens over the past decade and a half in our urban areas. He talked about interim measures and providing places in St. Patrick's if the Minister for Education and Science will agree. It is unbelievable that after five years the Minister is talking about plans for remand and detention places.</P>
      <P>The most incredible and almost Kafkaesque, or should that be &ldquo;Gopaleenesque&rdquo; as he has the kind of bearing that Myles na Gopaleen would have written about, part of his speech was his saying that if we did something about company cars, it would impinge on the constitutional property rights of the gougers and thugs who sell or give away these cars. We would impinge on their constitutional property rights and make an assumption that the young people were going to drive the car. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in his next incarnation, should consider a career as a comic &ndash; the king of comedy from County Kerry. It is outrageous that he would insult me, the Labour Party and this House last night with this farrago of nonsense. He failed to provide the resources to the Garda or to create the necessary legal powers to deal with the issue of company cars, yet he gives us a rigmarole which a garda on his first day on duty might read from his notebook in a district court.</P>
      <P>It is an outrage and I am glad it is the second last night that he will be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform since he and Deputy Dempsey will not be missed in their Departments. I hope that in a few short weeks we will have two new, vigorous Ministers who will address these issues, the alienation and despair on the sick and deprived estates of our cities and town, gaps in the law, and the lack of resources for the Garda, as well as look at new structures for the Garda to be more effective as Garda representative bodies have wanted for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few hours after we leave here tonight, and for many hours after, in parts of the country, there will be the screech of vehicles being driven at 80 or 100 miles per hour through suburban streets. It will get louder and louder. Children will gather on corners to shout and create a din. The Garda will be informed and some vehicles will be sent out to desperately try to prevent young children and innocent passers-by from being injured. The mayhem will go on for hours. That will happen tonight and tomorrow and has been happening every night for the five years of Deputy O'Donoghue's ministry. This has been happening and the Minister has not dealt with it as he has not dealt with many problems. He has been a grossly incompetent and hypocritical Minister. He talks of zero tolerance yet he is leav<Col N="1177" /> ing this country with tracts of our cities in a state of insurrection and mayhem and with our children in grave risk. That is his legacy.</P>
    <P>Many communities have tried to cope with this. Two years ago, when this party held a seminar to which we invited gardaí and community leaders, we heard stories of mayhem, despair and grief. We pledged to act but not in a simplistic way. This Bill is one of eight major initiatives which have to be taken in order to address this problem. Yet two years later, despite the Minister's waffle and comic lines, we have achieved nothing and those communities are in more despair than ever. I say to the people in those communities tonight &ldquo;get mad, get angry and when the Fianna Fáil Deputies and Ministers come to the door, tell them that you are mad as hell and that you want them out of office&rdquo;. That is what I say to communities which have been plagued by joyriding in the past five years. &ldquo;Tell your Fianna Fáil Deputy, who says one thing tonight out of one corner of his mouth and votes down the Labour Party Bill, that you are mad as hell about this problem, that you will vote against them and will put them out&rdquo;. Tell them that you are mad as hell that the Taoiseach is prepared to spend hundreds of millions of euro on a crazy proposal which could end up with a professional sports franchise being located in our city, while in many areas our streets suffer from the gravest deprivation, social disorder is rife and there is nightly mayhem. We need to send a message from this House that the Government, by turning down this Bill, is abandoning the most deprived and disadvantaged communities. I tell the people to send a message in the next three weeks to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I will be delighted if at long last, in the next three weeks, the Progressive Democrats Party is finally down-sized. It down-sized everything in sight and got rid of everything that this State had built up over many years. I will be delighted if it is down-sized by the people, as it deserves to be &ndash; to use the type of phrase that the Progressive Democrats loved to use in this House.</P>
    <P>The simple Bill before us tonight seeks to make the seizure of a car for dangerous driving a specific crime, that is joyriding, as it says in section 2, &ldquo;to direct, organise or participate in the unauthorised taking of a vehicle for the purpose of dangerous driving in a public place&rdquo;. We are <Col N="1178" /> saying that young alienated people, who have dropped out of school, for whom Deputies Wood and O'Donoghue have made no provision in the past five years, yet who continue to defy their communities time and again will be punished severely. We want severe penalties imposed for that crime. We say in the first section that we would deal at long last with the horrendous problem, that has lasted for several decades, of company cars and end of life vehicles.</P>
    <P>We had an appalling response on this issue also from Deputy Dempsey, who was even criticised by three of his own Deputies tonight for talking about a voluntary, industry led scrappage scheme for cars. We know that he has been negotiating with them for four or five years, under the waste management Act of 1986, to establish a system of what Conor Faughnan calls a death certificate for every vehicle. The industry refuse to negotiate or to do it voluntarily. Last November, he told a colleague that if there was no agreement, he would introduce compulsory regulation in April. This is the last day on which he could have done so, but Deputy Dempsey has done nothing because his party is afraid to take on the vested interest of the small cartel that controls the Irish car industry, just as it was afraid to take on the vested interest of the small cartel that controls the insurance industry and that which controls rented accommodation. Led by these two Ministers, Fianna Fáil has backed away from a range of issues and failed to take necessary action.</P>
    <P>Our Bill provides for stiff penalties on indictment of up to seven years or a fine of &euro;32,000 for its two key elements. A senior member of the Garda says the Bill is needed while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who says he does not interfere in the operational matters of the Garda, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government say it is not. Two years ago I said if there were more deaths or serious injuries as a result of this desperate crime, let it be on the heads of the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Environment and Local Government and the Taoiseach. I reiterate that if there are more deaths and destruction as a result of this appalling carry on, which the Government has ignored, let it be on the heads of Deputy Bertie Ahern and the disgraced outgoing Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Astonishing revelations of a perceived systematic cover-up of rape, gross indecency, molestation and physical abuse of children from 1978 to 1990 is coming to light. It has been alleged that a senior figure within the Department of Education and Science was involved in a Dublin-based child sex ring while he was deeply involved in examining alleged child abuse. The man, who retired some years ago, is named in a submission to the Laffoy commission on abuse set up to investigate abuse in residential centres and industrial schools. He is named in a statement by an abuse victim who claims he had sex with the man when he was a 17 year old male prostitute in Dublin.</P>
      <P>This man is the link to investigations into sexual abuse at residential centres in Kilkenny city, Cappoquin, County Waterford, and Clonmel. It has been claimed that the man was with convicted murderer, Malcolm McArthur, when the two picked up the rent boy on the quays in Dublin. The youngster recognised the Department official. He had met him while he was a resident of St. Joseph's Industrial School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel. The man was the Department inspector who visited the centre.</P>
      <P>This man was also the person who investigated allegations of sex abuse against convicted paedophiles like David Murray and Myles Brady in Kilkenny and gave them a clean bill of health. Incredibly, he gave one of the worst offenders, David Murray, a clean bill of health and this is confirmed in statements to that court case by two different witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This man is the golden thread weaving through a number of centres where children were in some cases tortured and forced to have sex with animals. He has never come to the attention of the Garda. His name keeps coming up when journalists speak to health board officials and others about what happened in these places. What does <Col N="1181" /> the Department of Education and Science know about this and what has it done about it? At the very least this man was guilty of gross incompetence, and at very worst there is something dark and dirty being hidden from public view.</P>
    <P>It has also been alleged that a few clerics from one of the most idyllic religious centres in the country were regular visitors to St. Michael's residential centre in Cappoquin, County Waterford. This information has been volunteered by former South Eastern Health Board officials, gardaí and others. At least 30 of the children allegedly abused at St. Michael's are taking legal action against the Sisters of Mercy, the South-Eastern Health Board and the State. The allegations of misdeeds in the centre were made to the Garda, health board officials, staff members and an official within the Department of Education and Science. A man being held on charges relating to child pornography videos and a paedophile ring in several counties is being questioned about two separate alleged rapes at the centre between 1978 and 1990. The 57 year old psychiatric nurse has already spilt the beans on other incidents at St. Michael's.</P>
    <P>There are major links between the centre and St. Joseph's industrial school in Kilkenny where five different paedophiles operated. Mr. Murray, the convicted paedophile, received a clean bill of health from the same Department official after allegations of abuse were made against him. It is known that these members of staff at St. Joseph's, Kilkenny, also visited St. Michael's, Cappoquin, on a regular basis. The disgraced cleric Fr. Brendan Smyth, also visited the centre while a guest at Mount Melleray. A member of staff at St. Michael's, Mrs. Eileen Power, made a signed statement to the Garda in 1995 stating that she was extremely concerned for the welfare of the children. Again, this official came down to investigate St. Michael's. Why was something not done? Was a report made to the Department of Education and Science, the Minister or someone in authority in the Department? Did anyone really care? Does anyone really care within that Department about what happened these poor youngsters who were put into the care of the State and were then sexually abused?</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that all the abuse took place at the time the centre was managed by Nora Wall, the former Sister of Mercy nun who was appointed in 1978 when she was 30 years old. On 10 June 1999 she was convicted of raping a ten year old girl in her care between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 1989 by a jury in the Central Criminal Court. This was later quashed in the Court of Criminal Appeal on 27 July 1999 after the Director of Public Prosecutions applied for the conviction to be set aside as a witness was called during the trial who should not have been called. The Sisters of Mercy have never apologised to any of the victims who were abused in St. Michael's. The Department of Health and Children said that it was not told of the abuse at the time it occurred. It said that an article <Col N="1182" /> appeared in the <i>News of the World</i> in late 1996 and that was when the Department first learned of the abuse there.</P>
    <P>This does not make sense when one considers the number of officials who were investigating these matters. The Department of Education and Science said it was making voluntary discovery of all documents relating to child care to the Laffoy Commission. This is not good enough. A senior official has been implicated by a victim in a rent boy sex ring in Dublin with a convicted killer. Malcolm McArthur killed a women in the Phoenix Park and another man immediately after that. He was later found in the home of the then Attorney General, Mr. Patrick Connolly. Something has to be done to show these poor victims that someone does care.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be able to raise this matter on the Adjournment in an attempt to clear the air. Hopefully the Minister for Education and Science will be able to clarify these reports and indicate to me what action, if any, has been taken by his Department and what action he intends to take in the future.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to an article which appeared in a newspaper on 22 April. I note from the article that the body for which the Government official referred to worked, is not mentioned.

      <P>My Department has no information on any case which compares with that referred to in the newspaper. No communication has been received from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse about any such case. The Deputy may remember I was the Minister responsible for bringing that legislation through the House and I subsequently set up that commission. Needless to say, I would be very anxious that everybody would co-operate with it. If such a communication is made, the Deputy can rest assured that my Department will co-operate fully in any inquiries. In all cases in which the commission has sought information to date, I am entirely satisfied that my Department has given it every possible co-operation and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I care greatly about the victims of abuse, as does the Secretary General of my Department and the legal experts within it, which led to the <Col N="1183" /> Government setting up the commission in the first instance. We would be very anxious to access any information the Deputy may have and to co-operate fully with the commission. I assure the Deputy that my Department informs me that, to date, it has not received any communication from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse about any such case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter in regard to the constituency of Tipperary South. The issue relates to the health service, particularly St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel. The split services in this area have been going on for a number of years. In 1996, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, tackled this long-ignored problem. Following much argument, people came to the conclusion that a one-sector hospital should be built in Clonmel to cater for the needs of the people of south Tipperary. I welcome the recent commitments that have been given for Cashel in recent weeks. I have been asked to raise this issue by the staff and people closely associated with St. Joseph's.</P>
      <P>When will financial approval be given for the construction of the 23 bed top-floor ward at the hospital? It is an essential part of the development and there is grave concern regarding it. A fundraising scheme for a catscan was launched 12 months ago with the goal of raising £500,000. That goal was exceeded and £650,000 was collected, yet the facility has not been put in place although commitments have been given. When will a permanent building be put in place for a catscan facility? When will approval be given for the roofworks on the residential unit of the hospital? That is a hugely important issue and people fear that there is insufficient funding to complete the project. Escalating building costs in the past number of years put more pressure on the funding that was available. I want a guarantee that everything will be done to complete the project as it was originally envisaged rather than leaving it unfinished with incomplete facilities. The people of south Tipperary deserve and demand better. They have had poor health services for years and are angry at the time it has taken to put it in place. I look forward to a positive reply from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the opportunity afforded to me by Deputy Hayes to set out the position in relation to the development of hospital services in south Tipperary.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of hospital services for south Tipperary is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. The south Tipperary hospital agreement which was signed in January 1996 paved the way for development of hospital services in the region and for bringing together surgery and medicine on a single site. A major capital development programme is under way to provide for the transfer of surgical services from Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, and the progression of other developments in line with the agreement. The transfer of surgery from Cashel to Clonmel is under way with the construction of phase 1 of the development at St. Joseph's Hospital which is costing in the region of &euro;20 million. Building work is in progress and is due to be completed by the end of 2002 or early 2003. This landmark development will involve the provision of a new accident and emergency department, more ward accommodation, operating theatres, an intensive care unit, a day care unit, a central sterile supplies department, physical medicine department, an education centre and consulting rooms.</P>
      <P>After the transfer of the surgical services, Our Lady's Hospital will be used to provide services for the elderly and also services for those with mental and physical disabilities. In this context the Minister for Health and Children gave approval to the South-Eastern Health Board on 17 April 2002 to proceed with the building of the first phase of the capital developments at the hospital. The building cost of the first phase is in the region of &euro;7 million and will provide on the site a 20 bed unit for mentally infirm elderly people, a 12 place supervised hostel for mental health services, 12 independent living units and respite care places for persons with physical disability, a day hospital and day centre for mental health services and a day centre for persons with physical disabilities. This approval will ensure that construction can now commence on this latest phase of developments for the south Tipperary Hospitals. This project together with the major construction project at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, represents a capital investment of some &euro;30 million for the development of hospitals in south Tipperary. The investment is an indication of the Government's commitment to the provision of optimum health care facilities to the people of the region. Further developments at Our Lady's Hospital will commence when surgical services have been transferred to St. Joseph's, Clonmel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many hospitals have experienced heavy demand for general medical beds in recent years. In an effort to deal with the extra demand for beds the Department of Health and Children provided additional capital funding of &euro;1.891 million <Col N="1185" /> and revenue funding of &euro;5.75 million to the South-Eastern Health Board in 2002. This included revenue funding for an additional 15 temporary acute medical beds located in St. Anthony's unit close to the hospital in order to alleviate the pressure on beds in St. Joseph's during phase 1 construction. The South-Eastern Health Board has made submissions to the Department for the additional works mentioned by the Deputy to be included as part of the current developments. The Department of Health and Children recently gave approval to the South-Eastern Health Board to allow the builder in Clonmel to carry out enabling works which will allow the future provision of an additional 23 acute medical beds at the end of phase 1 of the development. The Department is at present in discussion with the South-Eastern Health Board in relation to the additional beds, the permanent cat scan facility and the other works.</P>
    <P>The &euro;30 million investment in the hospitals is clear evidence of our commitment to the region. The overall objective of these major capital developments in Clonmel and Cashel is to ensure that the services available to the people of south Tipperary respond to their needs and we will continue to work towards their development. I am sure the Deputy will agree that substantial progress has already been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very obliged to the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter for discussion because of the hardship being imposed on very vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>The St. John of God Menni service has been forced to introduce cutbacks affecting some of the most vulnerable people in society with effect from 22 April because of a shortfall in its budgetary allocation for 2002. The impact on the clients affected is very severe and the implications for the parents and carers of the clients is additional strain, inconvenience and the almost intolerable burden of being confronted with no respite care for their loved ones. These measures have been implemented due to the forced cuts in expenditure of &euro;710,000 and the director has been allocated &euro;2.9 million short of his budget to maintain the 2001 level of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost reduction measures have very serious repercussions. The closure of six respite beds at Old Bawn, Tallaght, will in turn mean a 50% reduction in the respite services available to support the students in the St. John of God school, Islandbridge, the discontinuance of the summer camp, reduced extended day and holiday break programmes and the deferral of the move of 60 clients to a new day centre in Tallaght, planned for August and September 2002. It will also defer the commencement of a supported living programme for 38 clients at Tallaght which had been planned for late 2002. There will be a total of 25 jobs and ten day places affected in Celbridge and <Col N="1186" /> the 2002 new service development fund will have to be transferred to protect existing services. The filling of 19 vacancies within the service will be deferred, ten of them until January 2003. Of these posts, a significant number relate to the multi-disciplinary team and include speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists and social workers.</P>
    <P>The order has 19 vacancies, ten of which have been deferred to 2003 and in circumstances where it is difficult to secure such staff, this is extremely grave and makes the planning of services very difficult. I plead with the Minister of State on the last Adjournment debate of the 28th Dáil to immediately intervene to provide the funding to alleviate the plight of the clients and their carers. Wherever cutbacks have to be made, they should not be visited on people who are so vulnerable and in need of the very limited services that are in place. I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell us that the Government that thinks it can afford to spend &euro;1 billion to build a football stadium can at least provide respite care for people who are badly in need of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue.</P>
      <P>In recent years this Government has made significant additional funding available to services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. By the end of this year we will have provided additional revenue and capital funding amounting to nearly &euro;312 million. Within the overall revenue funding which has been provided, specific amounts have been allocated to develop new services and to meet identified needs with existing ones. The changing profile of those who have been in services for many years has led to a need to review issues such as staffing levels and skill mix. For example, an increased need for additional night cover has arisen in many agencies because of the more dependent profile of the residents due to old age, illness or behavioural issues. An ongoing review process has been under way for a number of years in the health boards and voluntary agencies and funding has been allocated annually to meet these identified needs. Significant additional funding has also been allocated for the development of new services. By the end of this year, around 1,700 new residential, 470 respite and 3,000 day places will have been provided since 1997. There has also been a significant enhancement of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability or autism and the specialist support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any funding for new services or to meet existing needs which may be made available to the health boards or the Eastern Regional Authority <Col N="1187" /> in any given year is specifically identified in the letter of determination. This funding is agreed by Government and must be used for the purpose set out in the letter. Therefore, I assure the Deputy that freezing or serious curtailment of developments in respect of which funding has been provided and agreed with the Department as part of a board or authority's service plans will not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of funding for organisations providing services for people with an intellectual disability or autism in the eastern region is a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The Minister understands that the authority is in ongoing discussions with the St. John of God Order and other voluntary agencies with regard to their 2002 budgets. He has asked the authority to keep him informed of the outcome of those discussions.</P>

As is normal practice, my Department will be entering into detailed discussions with the Department of Finance to agree funding requirements for 2003 and beyond, including funding for strategy specific issues.</P>
      <P>The budget day package published in December 2001 provided funding for 2002 which amounted to &euro;209 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital in respect of the health strategy initiatives. This funding will provide for the development of new initiatives and further development of certain existing services which are described in the strategy. In addition to the budget day package, the Abridged Estimates Volume 2002, published last November, made available for 2002 a further &euro;161 million for the items described as development of existing services in the strategy.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that the record of this Government has been unparalleled in relation to its resourcing of the health and children's services. Since 1997 to date, the investment in this area has increased from a level of under &euro;3.5 billion to the current level at just under &euro;8.2 billion, which represents an increase of over 134%.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The average number of acute in-patient beds available in December 2001 was 12,000 of which 3,781 were in the eastern region. The number of beds available in 1977 was 17,376, of which 4,753 were in the eastern region. The number of beds available in 1975 was 16,807. These figures include private beds in public hospitals. My Department does not collect statistical information in respect of private hospitals.</P>
      <P>The number of acute in-patient beds stood at 17,665 in 1980. Approximately 4,000 beds were removed from the hospital system between 1984 and 1988. A further 2,000 were removed between 1991 and 1993. Despite the reduction in bed stock, the number of in-patients treated has remained remarkably constant over the period as a whole; in 1980 there were 543,698 in-patient admissions and in 2000 the number was 548,834.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted by my <Col N="1191" /> Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review, titled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which was published on 16 January 2002, helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 additional acute beds for public patients over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. In tandem with the publication of the report, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 acute hospital beds at a cost of &euro;65 million, of which 335 are in the eastern region. My Department has been advised, by the ERHA and the health boards, that 98 of these beds have been commissioned and an additional 23 beds will come on stream by the end of April 2002, with a further 49 beds by the end of May 2002. The balance will be introduced on a phased basis during the rest of this year.</P>

      <P>The figures the Deputy seeks are not readily available within my Department. However, over the three years 1998 &ndash; 2000 there has been an average of 2,341 reports to the health boards reporting suspected child sexual abuse. Approximately 40% of these are confirmed by the health boards as abuse having taken place.</P>
      <P>The recently launched SAVI Report has found that one in five women, 20%, reported experiencing contact sexual abuse in childhood. The report also states that one in six men, 16%, reported experiencing contact sexual abuse in childhood.</P>
      <P>We are continuing to learn how best to treat victims of sexual abuse, both at a personal and professional level. I am aware that rape and sexual assault can have a traumatic effect on victims and services must be in a position to respond accordingly. A national counselling service has been established in each of the ten health boards to provide confidential counselling to victims of abuse in childhood and receives funding of &euro;5.080 million annually. Over 40 counsellors have been recruited nationally and demand for their service is increasing steadily.</P>
      <P>I have also arranged for the provision of counselling services to victims of past abuse who are resident in the United Kingdom with the Immigrant Counselling and Psychotherapy, ICAP, based in London. ICAP is an independent, non-sectarian, non-political counseling-psychotherapy service, located in North London serving all areas of London and the UK. The service has 81 clinical staff throughout the UK at present and one of its principal aims is at providing culturally sensitive services to people of Irish descent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned that applicants should not experience excessive delays when they apply for inter-country adoption assessment. In the last four years a number of improvements have been put in place to facilitate couples who wish to adopt children from abroad. These include a standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment was introduced to streamline assessments and to provide a transparent system centred on the child's best interests and respectful to all the parties involved. This includes a Guide for Practitioners on the assessment process which was prepared by British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, BAAF, international leaders in the field. The framework, which is being used in all health boards, has been welcomed by the boards and couples; &euro;2,101,000 or £1,655,000 additional funding has been provided nationally to reduce the time spent by couples on the waiting lists. This additional funding has been targeted at recruitment of social work and administrative staff and the implementation of the standardised framework; working agreements have been made with China, Thailand, Belarus and the Philippines; legislation is being prepared to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993; and the recommendations of the organisation and management review of the Adoption Board are currently being implemented.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the delays being experienced by applicants for inter-country adoption assessment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. Delays have arisen over the past few years because of an increased interest in inter-country adoption and difficulties being experienced in the ERHA region in recruiting social workers. For the past two years I have worked closely with various groups involved in this area in an effort to provide a better service. I accept that the shortage in social workers is leading to intolerable delays for couples who have already experienced a lot of personal trauma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts are being made to deal with the current shortage of social workers by recruiting internationally and by increasing the number of training places nationally. Approximately 30 additional social work training places have been created since October 2001 and it is planned to <Col N="1194" /> increase the number of places by in excess of 85 to be phased in from 2002.</P>
    <P>Almost &euro;830,000, or £653,000, of the additional funding provided over the last four years for the service has been provided to the ERHA. Extra administrative personnel and office facilities have been provided to free up social workers to concentrate on assessments and to reduce travelling time. Because of the recruitment problems only 11.5 whole time equivalent of the 20 whole time equivalent social work posts which have been funded by my Department to carry out assessments are actually in place.</P>
    <P>I have previously written to all other health boards asking them to assist the ERHA in reducing their waiting lists and I again asked them for their help at the Conference on inter-country adoption &ndash; Sharing Best Practice, which I attended recently. Some boards have said they were in a position to help with preparation courses and this offer is being acted upon.</P>
    <P>I have also put the ERHA in touch with the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, BAAF, with a view to seeing if they are in a position to assist the ERHA in carrying out inter-country adoption assessments.</P>
    <P>The ERHA is establishing two new assessment units in the East Coast and Northern Area Health Boards to supplement the service for the region which is currently being provided by the South-Western Area Health Board, and I understand that three new social workers are likely to be in place by June 2002. The restructuring of the service will take place on a phased basis when the additional staff have come on board. A customer services officer to provide an improved information service is also being appointed.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies of my personal commitment to this issue and my desire that the resources allocated to the ERHA and other boards should be used to reduce waiting times for couples who wish to adopt children from abroad.</P>

The social worker planned a home visit for the afternoon of 21 March 2002. The social worker did make contact with the family that morning, however, as she <Col N="1195" /> failed to establish contact in the afternoon, the proposed visit did not take place. The senior psychologist was contacted and the family was referred for counselling. The family attended their first appointment on 4 April 2002. Further sessions are available to the family at their request.</P>

      <P>Life expectancy is the composite measure which provides the best overall summary of mortality rates. Since the 1950's, life expectancy at birth in Ireland has increased by a decade for men and by 12 years for women. During the same period, however, life expectancy across the European Union has shown even more striking improvements, and Ireland continues to be below the EU average.</P>
      <P>The reasons we continue to lag behind other EU countries become clear when we examine specific causes of death and mortality rates across the age spectrum. Ireland's record on infant mortality remains very good by international standards and is not a contributory factor to below average life expectancy. The main contributors are cardiovascular diseases and cancers which together account for nearly 65% of all deaths in Ireland each year. Life expectancy at age 65 for both men and women in Ireland remains the lowest in the EU reflecting the high mortality from these conditions.</P>
      <P>These major causes of mortality are discussed in some detail in the second chapter of the health strategy and the strategy incorporates many strands of activity in order to deliver a healthier population and a world-class health system. The national cancer and cardiovascular strategies both have preceded the health strategy and will continue to be implemented. These strategies are supported by the heart health task force and forum and the cancer forum. In addition, population health divisions will be set up both within the Department and in the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that improvement in life expectancy requires taking intersectoral action on lifestyle and environmental factors and taking more deliberate and assertive steps to address health inequalities. The first national goal of the health strategy is better health for everyone, and many of the actions set out in the health strategy <Col N="1196" /> under this goal will be instrumental in effecting improvements.</P>

      <P>As part of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner liaised with the solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society.

      <P>I received Mr. Gardiner's report on 5 March. The report consists of a 60 page opinion and a number of appendices, one of which comprises over 50 pages of legal advice from the US lawyers.</P>
      <P>I have briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the contents of the report, and I have provided the Irish Haemophilia Society with a copy of the report.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I have taken a range of important measures to improve the capacity of the public orthodontic services and place it on a sound, long-term footing.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North-Eastern Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine.</P>
      <P>The general objectives of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, namely, the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The Dental Council has already established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics. In addition, agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the introduction of the grade of specialist in orthodontics into the public service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations and its introduction will have a tremen<Col N="1198" /> dous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. An additional six-surgery facility and five-surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and the St. James's Hospital regional orthodontic unit respectively have also been developed under the initiative. My Department is exploring with boards every possibility to expand the level of services in the short-term such as the use of private specialist orthodontic practitioners and the treatment of patients in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year.</P>
    <P>These measures that I have taken have already positively impacted on the orthodontic services. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <P>The health boards, established under the Health Act, 1970, are the statutory bodies responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services in their functional areas. They are also the main providers of health and personal social care at regional level. The Health (Amendment) No. 3 Act, 1996, clarified the respective roles of health boards and their chief executive officers by making boards responsible for certain reserved functions relating to policy matters and major financial decisions, and chief executive officers responsible for executive matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is an important milestone in achieving greater accountability regarding expen<Col N="1199" /> diture and levels of indebtedness. The adoption of service plans, annual reports and annual financial statements are now deemed reserved functions of each health board and are vital tools in the planning process at regional and national level.</P>
    <P>Other recent changes to the system include the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2000 and the provision for a Health Boards Executive, HeBE, to carry out joint functions on behalf of the boards.</P>
    <P>The health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, was very forthright in identifying some weaknesses in the health system that needed to be addressed in moving forward. One of these concerned the balance between national and local decision-making; another related to a lack of consistency in the standard and stage of development of services and the less than effective promulgation, at times, of best practice across the regions.</P>
    <P>It was accepted as part of the strategy that these issues needed to be addressed and a framework for organisational reform is set out in some detail in chapter 5 of the health strategy. I refer the Deputy to actions 110, 112,113 and 114 set out in the strategy.</P>
    <P>Action 110 also refers to the need for health boards to take explicit responsibility for driving change in relation to the new agenda and in providing the best possible value for money.</P>
    <P>Action 112 refers to the establishment of the role of the HeBE to carry out certain executive functions on behalf of health boards. HeBE will provide an important avenue for ensuring that the health boards can operate jointly on issues where a national approach to implementing a programme or service is the best way of achieving the objectives of the strategy. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Health Boards Executive was launched on 15 February this year, ahead of schedule. Earlier this week I had the pleasure of launching three reports prepared under its aegis &ndash; the first fruits of the conjoint working process.</P>
    <P>Action 113 refers to the role of the Office for Health Management. The Office for Health Management is currently focused on management development in the health system. Under this action, the brief of the office will be expanded to include organisational development. In this context, it will work closely with my Department to initiate organisational development programmes aimed at co-ordinating structures, strategy, culture, processes and people. Given this office's track record to date in its brief of management development, I have great confidence that soon it will be making its presence felt in relation to the wider agenda.</P>
    <P>Action 114, an independent audit of functions and structures in the health system, will provide an opportunity to critically examine the number and configuration of existing health organisations, their interactions with one another and with the Department of Health and Children; the <Col N="1200" /> adequacy of governance arrangements; and the scope for rationalisation.</P>
    <P>I am placing an emphasis on a reform agenda which is focused not on &ldquo;visible&rdquo; change &ndash; change for its own sake &ndash; but change which is aimed at providing a responsive, adaptable health system which meets the needs of the population effectively and at affordable cost. The tendering process for the audit of functions and structures is currently under way and my aim is to have consultants appointed and the project commenced at the earliest possible date.</P>

The overall aims identified by the strategy are to reduce the risk factor profile in the general population; detect those at high risk; deal effectively with those who have clinical disease; and ensure the best survival and quality of life.</P>
      <P>When the strategy was launched a number of implementation structures were established at national and regional level. These included the heart health task force, the Advisory Forum on Cardiovascular Health and regional committees at health authority-board level. Through the prioritisation of the implementation for the strategy, as advised by the Advisory Forum on Cardiovascular Health, and work of other groups, a co-ordinated, systematic and sustainable approach to its implementation has been adopted.</P>
      <P>In the first three years of the strategy, &euro;45 million has been allocated to its implementation and has advanced the implementation in all sectors, including the hospital sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, during 2001, a working group was set up and chaired by Comhairle na nOspidéal with representatives from the Department of Health and Children and the Advisory Forum on Cardiovascular Health to plan the future consultant cardiologist requirements needed to <Col N="1201" /> implement the recommendations of the cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
    <P>This group submitted in May 2001 an interim report recommending 25 additional consultant cardiology posts for 2002. This interim report has taken account of the submissions from health boards and the recommendations contained in Building Healthier Hearts.</P>
    <P>From funds available in 2002, boards have planned to appoint four additional consultant cardiologists, two in the South-Eastern Health Board, one in the North-Eastern Health Board and one, on a locum contract basis, in the Southern Health Board. In addition to these posts, approval has been given by my Department to the ERHA to appoint two paediatric cardiologists to Crumlin hospital.</P>
    <P>I have met with representatives from the advisory forum, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cardiac Society to discuss the Government's response to this interim report and I gave assurances of the Government's commitment to the cardiovascular health strategy, its acceptance in full of the interim report by Consultant Cardiology Manpower group, and that I and my officials are exploring how further new posts can be put in place this year.</P>
    <P>I have also requested the group to provide me with its final report as soon as possible so that the full consultant cardiology requirements for the country in light of the cardiovascular health strategy can be considered and implemented over time.</P>

      <P>The drugs payment scheme, DPS, introduced on 1 July 1999, essentially amalgamated the existing drug cost subsidisation, DCSS, and drugs refund schemes, DRS, and provided that families would only have to meet the first &euro;53.33 or £42 per month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The threshold for the DCSS scheme was &euro;40.63 or £32 per month per individual, and &euro;114.28 or £90 per quarter for each eligible person and dependants for the DRS. Under the DRS, the person had to pay for the drugs at the pharmacy, and claim a refund from the health board at the end of the quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new scheme was designed to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes, to be more user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. The DPS was also designed to iron out anomalies whereby, for example, a person or family spending &euro;101.58 or £80 in one month on medicines and no expenditure for the remainder <Col N="1202" /> of the quarter would not be entitled to a refund. Under the DPS, families are able to budget for the cost of prescribed medicines. Regardless of the cost of their prescribed medicines, families are liable only for a maximum of &euro;53.33 or £42 in any month. A further advantage is that applicants are not required to pay and then claim a refund as in the previous schemes. In addition, there are no qualifying criteria for the DPS, unlike the DCSS where a person needed a doctor's certificate and to be approved by a health board as having a long-term medical condition requiring regular and continuous prescribed drugs in excess of &euro;40.63 or £32 per month.</P>
    <P>The financial benefits of the DPS are reflected in the significantly increased spending level over the schemes it replaced. The total cost of the DRS and the DCSS in 1998 was £74.69 million, the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS cost £110 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and rose to £140 million in 2001. The aggregate benefits of the new scheme are clearly significantly greater than the previous schemes.</P>
    <P>The DPS was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced in due course. There were some legal precedents for this. Following further detailed consideration, the regulations were introduced in February 2001, putting the scheme on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Given that claimants overall derived greater benefit from the new scheme, as reflected in the significant increase in spending on it, the question of possible refunds was not addressed when the regulations were being put in place. This question is now being re-examined and I am awaiting further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have initiated a number of measures to estimate the number of doctors required by the State over the next decade and beyond. The Government approved the establishment of a national task force on medical staffing and the group's work is progressing well.</P>
      <P>The task force will, among other issues, consider the proposed development of a consultant delivered public hospital service and quantify the resource and cost implications involved. The task force will also address the reduction in working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors arising from the EU directive on working time and, in addition, it will consider the medical education and training requirements of our hospital medical workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force's recommendations will have implications for the number of hospital doctors, <Col N="1203" /> both consultants and NCHDs, required in the public hospital service.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of doctors in general practice, the primary care strategy, which was published as part of the health strategy, states that a needs assessment of the composition and number of primary care teams in each health board area will be carried out within guidelines and frameworks developed by the forthcoming national primary care task force. A primary care human resources plan will be produced by the national primary care task force and the health boards to develop the capacity of primary care, including that of general practice. I established the primary care task force recently and it held its first meeting on 9 April.</P>
    <P>Immediate improvements in human resource planning as proposed in the health strategy will also be accelerated to enable projected longer term requirements for staff numbers and skills mix to be identified, particularly in the health and social care professions.</P>
    <P>The human resources plan will require the commitment and support of various professional providers and other staff involved in order to ensure that its successful development and implementation is progressed on a partnership basis. It will be based on the needs assessments to be carried out by individual health boards.</P>
    <P>To address this, work is progressing on the development of a new personnel, payroll, attendance and recruitment system, PPARS, which will capture essential data on each individual and post within the health service. The PPARS project is a fundamental building block in developing dependable, reliable and robust quality information to forecast human resource requirements for the health service in the future.</P>

      <P>The future funding requirements of the health services will be, as is normal, the subject of discussions in terms of the annual Estimates process. The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, sets out a programme of investment and reform that will stretch over the next decade. The recommendations as set out in the strategy have been accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the commitment to the strategy, the Government's Budget Day package published in December 2001 provided funding for 2002 which amounted to &euro;209 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital in respect of the health strategy <Col N="1204" /> initiatives. Additional funding under the no policy change Estimates process, made available for 2002 a further &euro;161 million for the items described as development of existing services in the strategy. Gross funding available for the health services in 2002 amounts to just under &euro;8.2 billion which, when compared to the corresponding 2001 figure, is an increase of over &euro;1.3 billion, 19.5%.</P>
    <P>The record of this Government demonstrates the importance that has been placed on securing additional investment for the health services. Since 1997, this Government has increased investment from a level of under &euro;3.5 billion to the current level at just under &euro;8.2 billion, which represents an increase of over 134%.</P>
    <P>In the normal course, Estimates discussions commence in early summer in respect of 2003 funding and it will be a matter for the new Government to decide its priorities at that point.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that action was recently taken by nursing staff employed in A&amp;E departments in order to highlight difficulties being experienced in service provision. Proposals put forward by the Labour Relations Commission aimed at resolving the difficulties which had arisen were accepted by all parties. Proposals in the agreement included, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of admission and discharge policy monitoring committees in relevant hospitals. I understand that these committees are in place and are working well. In addition, it was agreed that a full security assessment would be undertaken in each A&amp;E department in the country and that a national A&amp;E nursing staffing structures review group would be established to carry out an immediate examination of existing structures and staffing levels in A&amp;E departments. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that considerable progress is being made in implementing these commitments.</P>

      <Col N="1205" />The Deputy will also be aware that on 13 February this year, I announced the establishment of an A&amp;E forum to identify steps that can be taken immediately to alleviate current problems in A&amp;E services. The forum, which had its first meeting on 20 March 2002, was chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former President of Dublin City University. There were approximately 80 participants, representing hospital management, members of the medical and nursing professions, para-medical and non-nursing personnel, staff representative associations and unions, patient advocacy groups and other interested parties in attendance at day one of the forum. Day two of the forum is scheduled to take place on 1 May. The work of the forum will help to build on the existing and proposed policy framework for A&amp;E services as set out in the national health strategy. I am pleased with the response to the forum and I am confident that its work will contribute significantly to advancing the existing and proposed policy framework for A&amp;E services as set out in the national health strategy.</P>

      <P>In 1994, my Department issued a health services waste policy to all health boards and acute voluntary hospitals. The policy advocated good environmental and health and safety practices in the management, handling and disposal of all wastes generated in hospitals. Central to this policy were the segregation of health care waste into risk waste and non-risk waste and the initiation of a national contract to deal with the health care risk waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" />A national contract has been in operation for the past two years for the collection and treatment of health care risk waste by alternative technology. All acute hospitals now have their health care risk waste treated and disposed of in this manner. These arrangements are working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The non-risk hospital waste, which is largely domestic in nature, is disposed of by the municipal or commercial waste disposal route. A detailed guidance document was issued in 1999 on the segregation, packaging and storage of health care risk waste. This latter document has been updated recently in the light of recent regulatory changes relating to the transportation and carriage of such materials, and is currently undergoing a consultation process with the relevant parties. It is anticipated that it will be issued to the health agencies within the next month.</P>
    <P>In the wake of recent reports of alleged instances of illegal dumping of waste, some of which was stated to be hospital waste, my Department wrote to the health agencies drawing attention to the guidelines and stressing the importance of ensuring that reputable waste contractors are employed and that proof of disposal to licensed landfill site is obtained for each load of non-risk waste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the waiting list initiative, which was introduced in 1993, dedicated funding is made available to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out targeted in-patient waiting list procedures. The management and monitoring of the out-patient waiting lists is a matter for the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance. My Department collects and evaluates in-patient waiting list figures on a quarterly basis.</P>
      <P>The health strategy, which I launched last year, provides a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It outlines measures which are designed to address the issue of efficiency in the delivery of out-patient services. Protocols for investigation and referral to hospital out-patient departments will be developed in conjunction with general practitioners. Nurse-led clinics for selected conditions will be introduced where feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new health strategy also includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of in-patient waiting lists and particularly waiting times. The target set out in the strategy is that by the end of 2004 no public patient will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public <Col N="1207" /> patients. Where it is not possible to treat patients within a reasonable period in Ireland, either in public or private hospitals, health boards will make arrangements under the treatment purchase fund to refer public patients for treatment abroad, having regard to quality, availability and cost. This will always be subject to the patient's prior agreement and will be done in co-operation with the patient's consultant and/or general practitioner.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. My Department has been advised, by the ERHA and the health boards, that 98 of these beds have been commissioned and that an additional 23 beds will come on stream by the end of April 2002, with a further 49 beds by the end of May 2002. The balance will be introduced on a phased basis during the rest of the year. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospitals agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, is the most comprehensive strategy for the health sector ever. <Col N="1208" /> It represents a whole-system approach to the issue of health in Ireland and goes beyond the traditional concept of health services. It accepts that although a great deal has been achieved, much remains to be done. This includes a wide-ranging agenda encompassing everything from cross-sectoral working to influence the wider determinants of health, through to the development of specific services. It also encompasses a change agenda which is wide-ranging and ambitious.</P>
    <P>A number of items have been prioritised for this year. The Government has already shown its commitment to the health strategy through the funding for 2002 provided as part of the budget day package. Funding commitment amounts to &euro;209 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital, including new initiatives and further development of certain existing services which are described in the strategy. In addition to the budget day package, a further &euro;161 million is also available in 2002 for the items described as the development of existing services in the strategy.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced on a great number of actions in the health strategy. I am providing a complete list to the Deputy of all actions with key deliverables for completion up to and including this week. In addition, I have included reference to a number of other items on which significant progress is being made which have due dates later this year.</P>
    <P>In particular, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the following items. The following structures have been put in place: the departmental health strategy implementation team is in place; a vacancy at assistant secretary level has been filled in recent weeks; the primary care task force has been established; nominations for the steering group are currently being sought and Professor Ivan Perry of University College Cork has agreed to chair the group; and a treatment purchase team to manage the treatment purchase fund has been established. The team, which is inter-disciplinary, is led by independent consultant Ms Maureen Lynott, who has been appointed as project director; the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been established and Ms Olive Braiden has been appointed as chairperson; the National Committee on Breastfeeding has been appointed, chaired by Professor Miriam Wiley of the ESRI; and the Health Boards Executive was established on 15 February.</P>
    <P>The following documents have been published: The primary care document, Primary Care: A New Direction, was published in November 2001; the consultation document, Your Views About Health, was published in January 2002; and Traveller Health &ndash; A National Strategy 2002-2005 was published in January.</P>
    <P>The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill has been signed into law, and scheduling of the implementation process including the making of commencement orders and regulations is under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" />Progress is also being made on the following key actions: finalisation of the national environmental health action plan; review of medicines legislation; licensing of alternative medicines; information-education campaign on the strategy's goals and objectives; commissioning of over 700 additional acute hospital beds; preparation of an action plan for people management; restructuring of the Department of Health and Children; and audit of functions and structures in the health system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" />The health strategy published in November is an ambitious plan. Implementing it will require sustained effort over the next seven to ten years and there will be challenges for everyone working in the system along the way. Both the Department's business plans and the health boards service plans for this year reflect the priority objectives of the strategy and I am very pleased with the progress that has been made to date.</P>

This letter drew their attention to specific initiatives in which it is envisaged other Departments would play a significant or lead role; and also referring specifically to actions that will require co-ordination between more than one Department. This included reference to the need to embed an explicit commitment to sustaining and improving health status in departmental strategies and business plans.</entry>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding shortages of qualified therapy personnel, including occupational therapists, my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of occupational therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. The report therefore advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for occupational therapy in order to achieve an increase of over 150% in the number of occupational therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the Bacon report. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group with a view to early progress in the provision of the extra training places recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" />Initiatives to progress other key recommendations included in the Bacon report are set out below: the planned establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators to support the provision of additional clinical placements; concerted overseas recruitment of scarce therapy personnel undertaken on behalf of all the health boards by the Northern Area Health Board; the establishment of the health skills group under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to support the development of integrated workforce planning and improved human resource planning in the health service; the ongoing implementation of the report of the expert group on various health professions to address outstanding issues including workload, working practices and skills-mix highlighted in the Bacon report; and the preparation of a scheme for the statutory registration for health and social care professionals, consistent with the requirement for a person-centred health service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the review of the national nuclear emergency plan, which is co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise, it was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I accepted this recommend<Col N="1215" /> ation and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, acting on behalf of my Department, notified the European Commission on 19 October 2001 of our invitation to tender for the supply of iodide or iodine tablets.</P>
      <P>The procedures laid down under Directive 93/36/EEC, which allow for an accelerated tendering process with regard to the award of public supply contracts, were followed to enable purchase of these stocks at the earliest possible opportunity. A contract for the supply of potassium iodate tablets was awarded to Kelkin Limited, Unit 1, Crosslands Industrial Park, Dublin 12, on 21 December 2001. Furthermore, the relevant statutory instrument requiring medicines to have product authorisations was amended to facilitate the placement on the market of these tablets without such authorisation. The first consignment of 1.5 million tablets was delivered last week and final deliveries from Kelkin are expected by the end of May.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Government task force on emergency planning, chaired by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, it has been decided to distribute the tablets directly to each household in the country through the postal system. In order for the cartons of tablets to be distributed safely and securely through the post it is essential to further package and label each carton. Therefore, a further tendering process was necessary for the provision of a mail fulfilment service to adequately package the cartons of tablets for delivery to each household. The ERHA, following the appropriate tendering process under EU legislation, awarded a contract to DC Kavanagh Limited, 43 Dolphins Barn Street, Dublin 8 and SonoPress Ireland Limited, Swords Business Park, County Dublin, for the fulfilment of the tablet cartons into purpose designed envelopes.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that fulfilment would be completed within ten days of the final delivery of tablets from Kelkin. My Department is currently liaising with An Post and making the necessary contractual arrangements in order to ensure the secure delivery of a carton of tablets to each household as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the existing stocks, which were distributed in 1991, I am advised that the current stock held by each board is as follows: Eastern Regional Health Authority: 720,000, tested 16 months ago and usable at that time; South-Eastern Health Board: 360,000, tested in 2000 and usable at that time; North-Eastern Health Board: 180,000, tested in 1999 and usable at that time; North-Western Health Board: 3,000 untested tablets; Mid-Western Health Board: 300,000 untested tablets; Midland Health Board: Nil; Western Health Board: Nil; Southern Health Board: Nil.</P>

      <P>I established the Forum on Fluoridation in May 2000. The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. The forum held its first meeting in September 2000.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the forum are as follows: to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area; and to report to the Minister. The forum invited members of the public to forward their views on the issues under consideration and received in excess of 1,000 submissions, each of which has been examined individually.</P>
      <P>The forum was originally to report in September 2001. As a result of foot and mouth disease precautions, the March 2001 meeting was cancelled and, consequently, a one month extension was approved to October 2001. I am informed by the chairman of the Forum on Fluoridation that a number of complex issues arose during the finalisation of the report. These caused a further delay due to the additional and unexpected workload involved.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the forum has informed me that the work of the forum in relation to its report is being progressed. In the meantime, I will not pre-empt the recommendations of the forum.</P>

      <P>At my request Comhairle na nOspidéal undertook a review of the structures, operation and staffing of A&amp;E departments in hospitals providing A&amp;E services. The report of the review entitled Report of the Committee on Accident and Emergency Services has recently been presented to me. The report examines and makes recommendations on the provision of emergency services in public hospitals in the State. It explores factors that affect efficiency and effectiveness of hospital emergency services and links reform of A&amp;E departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient <Col N="1217" /> flows through the hospitals. I am confident that its work will contribute significantly to advancing the existing and proposed policy framework for A&amp;E services as set out in the national health strategy.</P>
      <P>A factor in limiting access to hospital beds and a major cause of delays in A&amp;E departments is the availability of in-patient beds. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, has conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of that review entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, the Government has decided to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. I announced on 16 January a &euro;65 million investment package in the current year for the commissioning of 709 of these 3,000 beds in acute hospitals. My Department has been advised, by the ERHA and the health boards, that 98 of these beds have been commissioned, that an additional 23 beds will come on stream by the end of April 2002, with a further 49 beds by the end of May 2002. The balance will be introduced on a phased basis during the rest of the year.</P>

      <P>The chief executive officer of the board took immediate steps to deal with the situation as soon as he became aware of it and the board initiated a review which was carried out by experts nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>I established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency on 2 October 2001 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961. I subsequently appointed the board of the agency, with Ms Olive Braiden as chairperson. Two staff have been seconded from my Department to enable the agency to become operational as soon as possible. Premises in Capel Street, Dublin 1 have been acquired by the agency and have been fitted out and equipped. The agency moved into these offices on 9 January.</P>
      <P>The agency has informed me that its first priority is the recruitment of key staff. The agency hopes to appoint a director very shortly. Preliminary interviews have been held for the appointment of three managers and the board also hopes to appoint these without delay.</P>
      <P>The agency has already met with a number of key agencies for initial consultations. The agency intends to conduct a wide-ranging process of consultation leading to the drafting of a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy. For this purpose it placed advertisements in the national press yesterday inviting submissions from Departments, service providers, interested parties and the public on all relevant issues. A sum of &euro;6.5 million has been provided for the agency in the current year. The agency will be considering the allocation of this funding in the course of the year.</P>
      <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency is to be a planning and co-ordinating body, rather than a provider of services. Its principal tasks, once it is fully operational, will be to prepare the national strategy on crisis pregnancy and then, on an ongoing basis, to oversee the implementation of this strategy by a range of statutory and non-statutory agencies.</P>

      <P>The retail pharmacy sector has not been deregulated. It is subject to a wide range of legislative controls. The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act. The 1996 regulations, which I revoked in January this year following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts with the health boards.</P>
      <P>The effect of the revocation for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts is that there are no restrictions on granting new community pharmacy contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapsed with the regulations. Those affected should contact the relevant health board directly concerning re-applying.</P>
      <P>The Pharmacy Review Group was established to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. It is now being asked to report as quickly as possible, given the new situation. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. It is my intention to introduce community pharmacy regulations to cover, on an interim basis, the period from now until the publication of the Pharmacy Review Group's report.</P>

      <P>The total number of people on public hospital waiting lists at 31 December 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, was 26,126. This figure represents a decrease of 1,731 or 6% on the comparable figure for December 2000.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has also been made in reducing waiting times for public patients waiting for treatment. The number of adults waiting more than 12 months for treatment in the target specialties has fallen by 14% over the period December 2000 to December 2001. The number of children waiting for more than six months for treatment in the target specialties has fallen by 3% over the same period.</P>
      <P>The new health strategy, which I launched last year, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times. The target set out in the strategy is that by the end of 2004 no public patient will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients. Where it is not possible to treat patients within a reasonable period in Ireland, either in public or private hospitals, health boards will make arrangements under the treatment purchase fund to refer public patients for treatment abroad, having regard to quality, availability and cost. This will always be subject to the patient's prior agreement and will be done in co-operation with the patient's consultant and-or general practitioner.</P>
      <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. My Department has been advised by the ERHA and the health boards that 98 of these beds have been commissioned, that an additional 23 beds will come on stream by the end of April 2002 with a further 49 beds by the end of May 2002. The balance will be introduced on a phased basis during the rest of the year. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients and a national hospitals agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident that these measures will result in a <Col N="1223" /> more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

      <P>The report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children's examination of the orthodontic service is a comprehensive document and contains 31 wide-ranging recommendations that are being considered as a matter of priority by my Department and the health boards.</P>
      <P>My Department, in its submission to the joint committee, acknowledged that the extent of the waiting list and waiting time for orthodontic assessment and treatment is unacceptable and is a matter of serious concern. The prevailing situation is compounded by the fact that orthodontic services are restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. This shortage has resulted from, among other things, divisions within the orthodontic community that have triggered difficulties and resistance in agreeing arrangements for training programmes.</P>
      <P>I note that the joint committee has recognised the divisions within the profession and their impact on the extent of the waiting list and time for orthodontic assessment and treatment. In addition, the committee identified enhanced training opportunities as an important element in improved delivery of orthodontic services. Notwithstanding the difficulties in agreeing training programmes in a minority of health board areas, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that there has been significant progress in this area.</P>
      <P>In October last year, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North-Eastern Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine.</P>
      <P>The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" />My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, namely, the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The Dental Council has already established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics. In addition, agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the introduction of the grade of specialist in orthodontics into the public service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations and its introduction will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. An additional six-surgery facility and five-surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and the St. James's Hospital regional orthodontic unit respectively have also been developed under the initiative. My Department is exploring with boards every possibility to expand the level of services in the short term such as the use of private specialist orthodontic practitioners and the treatment of patients in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>These measures that I have taken have already positively impacted on the orthodontic services. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic <Col N="1225" /> treatment will continue to increase as the above measures continue to take effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship. The Deputy is no doubt aware that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as the carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card.</P>

    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy launched by the Government late last year. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to last year's extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, and <Col N="1226" /> particularly children with a disability. This Government's commitment to extending medical card coverage should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society.</P>
    <P>A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations contained in the Review of the Medical Card Scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. These initiatives include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. During 2002, the Government's priorities for improving the health system and providing greater equity include 709 additional acute public hospital beds and 200 beds contracted from the private sector; addressing waiting times through a new treatment purchase fund and maintaining investment levels in the general programme to reduce waiting lists; commencing implementation of the new model of primary care; services for people with a disability; and services for older people.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have taken a range of important measures to improve the capacity of the public orthodontic services and place it on a sound, long-term footing.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the North-Eastern Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has pro<Col N="1227" /> vided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist quali<Col N="1228" /> fications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. An additional six-surgery facility and five-surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and the St James's Hospital regional orthodontic unit respectively have also been developed under the initiative. My Department is exploring with boards every possibility to expand the level of services in the short term such as the use of private specialist orthodontic practitioners and the treatment of patients in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following information on their orthodontic waiting lists as at the end of the December 2001 quarter:</P>

    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2002. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputies.</P>
      <P>While all sectors reported that recruitment was well ahead of resignations-retirement, employers reported that 1,089 vacancies existed at 31 January 2002. These circumstances arise where the volume of additional nursing posts being created outstrips capacity to recruit. The combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime working provides the equivalent of around 1,270 full-time nurses to the service to cope with difficulties arising in the provision of services while employers continue the recruitment process to fill vacancies.</P>
      <P>A major recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of &euro;6.35 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives. In particular, a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent, part-time basis.</P>
      <P>As part of my overall recruitment-retention strategy, I have introduced the following: financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses; payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses; and financial support to State-enrolled nurses, SENs, working in the Irish health service wishing to undertake nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy situation. A total of 2,719 working visas-work authorisations were issued to nurses from non-EU countries between June 2000 and January 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" />My Department is also engaged in strategic planning through the study of the nursing and midwifery resource. The focus of this work is on longer term planning. The primary objective of the study is to forecast, as far as is possible, future nursing and midwifery workforce needs. An interim report was published in October 2000 and widely circulated within the health services. The final report is due to be published in June 2002.</P>
    <P>On 1 November 2001, I launched the new four-year undergraduate pre-registration nursing degree programme which will commence for the academic year 2002-03.</P>
    <P>The new nursing degree programme, to replace the current three-year diploma programme, will put the education of nurses on a par with that of other health care professionals. The nursing profession has long been seeking such parity, and the Government's decision implements a central recommendation of the Commission on Nursing. Educating nurses to degree level will enable them to develop their clinical skills to a greater extent and to respond to future challenges in health care, for the benefit of patients and client groups.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved a capital building programme totalling &euro;223.5 million for the construction of facilities to accommodate nursing students at 13 higher education institutions throughout the country. This programme is due to be completed by September 2004.</P>
    <P>A total of 1,640 places nationally will be available on the degree programme as follows:</P>

      <P>In his report on the nursing home subvention scheme, the ombudsman has drawn attention to the uncertainty surrounding the eligibility of older people for long-term residential care. The need for clarification of entitlement in this regard is recognised in the national health strategy which states that the issue will be covered by the general review of existing legislation on eligibility. The objective of the review will be to update and rationalise the current framework so as to provide a clear national framework for entitlement to health and personal social services. The target set down in the strategy to have a Bill published by the end of 2002 remains in place.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date by the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, which was established in February 2002; if he will urge the commission to expedite the publication of its report having regard to public concerns about human cloning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Assisted human reproduction, and in particular cloning, is an issue that raises a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues with associated legal, ethical, social and medical implications. While there is no legislation regulating this area, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These provide that the <Col N="1232" /> creation of embryos for experimental purposes would be professional misconduct. I am conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate cloning and a range of other issues associated with the area of assisted human reproduction, including research on embryos.</P>
      <P>With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, a Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction was established in March 2000, with the following terms of reference: to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction; and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.</P>
      <P>The commission has met on 11 occasions to date. The first meeting was held on 26 July 2000 and the most recent on 14 March 2002. I understand that the commission has adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its work. Initially, each discipline &ndash; medical, legal scientific and social &ndash; prepared a report outlining the current position within that discipline in relation to assisted human reproduction. Working groups were then formed to examine specific topics and issues that needed to be addressed. The working groups meet on a regular basis to discuss their tasks and to progress the work of the commission.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the working group structure facilitates close attention to a relatively limited range of topics by a highly specialised group. It also facilitates the detailed exploration of a range of ethical and social implications that arise from assisted human reproduction.</P>
      <P>The commission organised a one-day conference for commission members, and an invited audience of about 30, in Dublin Castle in September 2001. The conference dealt with the social, ethical and legal factors inherent in assisted human reproduction. It provided an opportunity for an exchange of views between experts in the various fields from Ireland, the United Kingdom, France and Germany.</P>
      <P>When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. In order to inform itself on the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction, the commission placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting interested members of the public, professional or voluntary organisations and other parties who wished to do so to make written submissions before Wednesday, 31 October 2001. Over 1,600 submissions have been received by the commission and are currently being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the commission is engaged in a number of information gathering exercises that include: (i) a survey of assisted human reproduction, AHR, services provided in specialised clinics, a survey instrument was drafted by the commission with a view to establishing the extent of the provision of AHR services in Ireland, the members of the secretariat are administering it <Col N="1233" /> and returns are already complete from the majority of recognised AHR centres in the country; (ii) a survey of GPs, the commission has issued a survey instrument to a random sample of 50% of GPs in all health board areas, replies were requested by 15 February and I understand that a high proportion of those surveyed have responded, these responses are being examined by the commission secretariat; and (iii) a survey of obstetricians and gynaecologists, the commission has also recently issued a survey instrument to obstetricians and gynaecologists to elicit information on their level of involvement in AHR services.</P>
    <P>Given the difficult nature of the issues to be examined it is not possible to be definitive about the length of time it will take the commission to complete its work but I am satisfied that it is making significant progress and will continue to work as expeditiously as is feasible. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

However, the person named then contacted my Department again to say that the person to whom she had sold her lands was now over the upper age limit for eligibility as a transferee under the scheme. The eligibility of the transferee is determined by his-her age at the time an application is made and, as stated, the person named has not made a formal application under the scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named has been a participant in the scheme of early retirement from farming since 31 January 1995 <Col N="1237" /> and had leased the pension lands to her transferee. That lease had an expiry date of 30 December 1999, while her transferee acquired enlargement lands by a lease with an expiry date of 31 December 1999.</P>
      <P>The person named extended the lease on the pension lands to 31 December 2001. Early in December 2001 she informed my Department that she proposed to transfer the pension lands to a different transferee after the lease had expired. While her proposal was being examined it was noted that there was no evidence that the existing transferee had renewed or extended the lease on the enlargement land after December 1999.</P>
      <P>It is a requirement of the EU Council regulation governing the scheme in which the person named is a participant that the transferee must enlarge the pension lands and farm the enlarged holding. Payment of pension is conditional on this and other conditions being met. My Department wrote to her on 16 April 2002, requesting evidence that during the two years for which his lease of the pension lands was extended, the first transferee had also either renewed the lease on the enlargement land or found other enlargement land. She was asked to produce the necessary evidence within one month, and advised of the implications for the future payment of her pension if she were unable to do so.</P>

      <Quest>if, in relation to a premises (details supplied) in Dublin 2, prior to the removal of asbestos, a report was commissioned and produced identifying the potential health hazards and risks; if so, the reason the occupants of the building were not advised of these health hazards and risks; the reason the area was not sealed off; the steps which were taken to eliminate these risks prior to the commencement of the work; the results of the dust meter readings taken by an engineer from the Office of Public Works; his Department's plans to conduct health check screenings for all the employees and occupants of the building who were present during the removal period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The occupants of Hawkins House did not access the area of the basement where the asbestos was located and the presence of the asbestos posed no risk to their health.</P>
      <P>Once the asbestos had been identified detailed specifications were drafted to ensure that the removal works complied with all of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the local authority and the Health and Safety Authority regulations. Prior to the work beginning the successful contractor forwarded to the Health and Safety Authority a method statement setting out how the asbestos would be safely removed and issued a notifications of commencement of asbestos works to the Health and Safety Authority. The system of work set out in the method statement ensured that the occupants of the building were not exposed to any risk during the removal works. A door to the basement if left open would not have compromised the integrity of the safe system of works that was in place at the time.</P>
      <P>At all times during the course of the building works the occupiers of the building were kept advised of developments. The results of the air sampling tests in the basement and foyer, which were conducted by a firm of consultants on behalf of the Office of Public Works, showed that each area was safe for normal occupation. As a safe system of work was followed at all times it is not considered necessary at this time to put in place plans to conduct health screening tests for all employees or occupants of the building.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the family friendly hours for nurses in St. John's Hospital, Sligo has been cancelled; the discussions which have taken place to ensure that the flexible working arrangements are re-instated as it is putting staff under undue hardship and causing significant inconvenience; if he will immediately redress this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12703/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): St. John's Hospital, Sligo is part of the North-Western Health Board's community hospital services. The hospital is presently incurring high nurse overtime costs which are projected to significantly exceed budgets by year end. If the board does not address this cost over-run then patient services at the hospital or elsewhere within the board will have to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The cost over-run on nursing overtime is directly related to difficulties in securing temporary nursing staff to undertake locum cover work and failure to reach agreement on revised rostering arrangements proposed by management to restore previously agreed nurse/patient ratios. In the absence of available temporary nurses, locum work is covered at overtime rates by existing permanent staff.</P>
    <P>Extensive discussions took place with the Irish Nurses Organisation to resolve the current staffing difficulties. Unfortunately, local discussions were unsuccessful in resolving the difficulties and the hospital sought the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission. A conciliation conference under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission was held on 15 February 2002. The Irish Nurses Organisation position remained unchanged despite a number of alternative options being proposed by management. The Irish Nurses Organisation continued to threaten industrial action in response to the board's proposal.</P>
    <P>All of the 95 whole time equivalents approved funded nursing posts at the hospital are now filled in a permanent capacity by nurses contracted to work 39 hours per week. Over a period of time up to 50% of these nurses have been facilitated with reduced working hours under either job sharing or flexible working schemes, approval of which schemes is discretionary to the board and is available subject to such flexible arrangements not impacting on the provision of services to patients.</P>
    <P>Given the difficulties outlined, and the failure of local discussions to resolve the issues it has regrettably become necessary to temporarily curtail the availability of these discretionary schemes in nursing services at St. John's Hospital, Sligo.</P>
    <P>The board as an employer supports family friendly policies and its track record is exemplary in that regard. Every effort will continue to be made by management locally to resolve these current difficulties including consideration of any individual circumstances arising.</P>
    <P>The board has advised the Nursing Alliance that it is available for discussions to resolve current difficulties.</P>

      <Quest>the reason motor neurone disease is not included as a long-term illness for medical card eligibility purposes.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12715/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: &ndash; mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to extend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with motor neurone disease.</P>
    <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): The effect of the revocation of the 1996 Pharmacy Regulations, for awarding new community pharmacy contracts, is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. However, the practice of pharmacy continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts. The revocation of the regulations does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand.</P>
    <P>The pharmacy review group is now being asked to report as quickly as possible and the type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. In the meantime negotiations between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and my Department are continuing with a view to introducing community pharmacy regulations to cover, on an interim basis, the period from now until the publication of the pharmacy review group's report.</P>
    <P>The determination of an application for a new community pharmacy contract agreement is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. However, in view of the current position with regard to the regulations I understand that most health boards have deferred the awarding of new agreements pending the introduction of interim regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" />I am pleased to advise the Deputy of the following measures that I have taken to improve the orthodontic services. In October last year, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine.</P>
    <P>The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced to the orthodontic service, namely the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The Dental Council has already established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics. In addition, agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the introduction of the grade of specialist in orthodontics into the public service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations and its introduction will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit, thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year, of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic prac<Col N="1248" /> titioners to treat patients. An additional six-surgery facility and five-surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and the St. James's Hospital regional orthodontic unit, respectively, have also been developed under the initiative. My Department is exploring with boards every possibility to expand the level of services in the short-term, such as the use of private specialist orthodontic practitioners and the treatment of patients in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>These measures that I have taken have already impacted positively on the orthodontic services. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that, at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment compared to the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the above measures continue to take effect. Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards have further informed me that the number of patients awaiting orthodontic treatment at the end of the December 2001 quarter was 11,890. This is a decrease of 1,613 in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the June 2001 quarter.</P>
    <P>For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, the initiatives that I have set out above will bring about an improvement in waiting times and I am considering other options whereby children who have been waiting for an extended period can be treated free of charge privately. There is currently no mechanism for reimbursing costs of orthodontic treatment received independent of health boards. However, tax relief is available in respect of such treatment costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 108 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total numbers of people on public hospital in-patient waiting lists for cardiac surgery, oph<Col N="1249" /> thalmology, and orthopaedics, as reported by the health agencies at 31 December 2001, the latest date for which figures are available, were as follows: cardiac surgery, 278; ophthalmology, 3,254; and orthopaedics, 4,205.</P>
    <P>Some hospitals did not provide details of the procedures to be carried out within the specialties of ophthalmology and orthopaedics. Therefore, the total number waiting for cataract operations and hip replacements is unavailable to my Department.</P>
    <P>The number of people on public hospital waiting lists in December 2001 was 26,126. This figure represents an overall decrease of 1,731, or 6% on the comparable figure for December 2000. Considerable progress has been made in reducing the waiting times for cardiac surgery. The number of adults waiting for 12 months and over for cardiac surgery decreased by 67% during the period from December 2000 to December 2001, and the number of children waiting for over six months for cardiac surgery fell by 72% in the same period. The number of adults waiting for 12 months and over for orthopaedic operations decreased by 19% during the same period.</P>
    <P>The new health strategy will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times in particular.</P>
    <P>The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment. By the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment, and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. Until these targets are achieved a new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients either in the private sector or, if necessary, abroad.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context, a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the new health strategy, has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long terms. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The strategy outlines further measures which are designed to address the issues of capacity and efficiency in the delivery of services. A strategic partnership will be developed with the private sector in providing services for public patients <Col N="1250" /> and a national hospitals agency will be set up to plan the configuration of hospital services. I am confident these measures will result in a more accessible and equitable acute hospital system for public patients.</P>

    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have further informed me that, at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>Structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>Six dentists from the South-Eastern Health Board, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the North-Eastern Health Board, commenced training in October last for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health <Col N="1251" /> boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced in the orthodontic service, namely the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The Dental Council has already established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics. In addition, agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the introduction of the grade of specialist in orthodontics into the public service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations and its introduction will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit, thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year, of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients and reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>

      <P>From 1997 to date, more than &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 64 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff. This level of funding far exceeds the £25 million, which was initially envisaged in 1996 and is a clear indication of this Government's continued commitment to the development of co-ordinated and patient-focused treatment in line with the national cancer strategy.</P>
      <P>This year a total of &euro;27.315 million was provided for the maintenance and development of cancer services. This includes the provision of &euro;23.55 million, which was allocated to the health boards for the continuing development of oncology services, including funding for oncology drug treatments.</P>
      <P>In relation to access to radiotherapy services, the Deputy will be aware that I established an expert working group on radiotherapy services to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services in this country. The work of the expert group is at an advanced stage. Because of the importance and the complexity of the work, it is not possible to give an exact date for the report of the expert group, but it is anticipated that its work will be completed in the near future. The provision of additional services for radiotherapy treatment will be considered in the context of the report of the group.</P>
      <P>The new health strategy identified the need for the preparation, by the end of 2002, of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. This will be prepared by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science are already involved in a multi-agency approach to developing responses, including the provision of custodial or care place provision where necessary, for troubled and troublesome young people. This work is taking place in the context of the implementation of the Children Act, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might be aware that the Cabinet committee on children decided that the National Children's Office &ndash; NCO &ndash; should take the lead role in relation to co-ordinating the implementation of the Children Act, 2001. A working group, chaired by the NCO and comprising high-level representation from this Department and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science and their respective local level agencies, has been established for this purpose. The Children Act is major legislation which provides a new framework for the development of the juvenile justice system and makes provision for addressing the needs of <Col N="1254" /> out-of-control, non-offending children. At the last meeting of the Cabinet committee on children I submitted proposals prepared by the working group in relation to the phased implementation of the Act. These proposals were approved by the Cabinet committee and significant parts of the Act will be brought into operation during 2002.</P>
    <P>The Children Act represents a major shift in terms of how children in the juvenile justice and welfare systems will be treated. There is a significant new emphasis in the legislation away from residential and custodial care to care in the community for these children. Detention is to be a last resort. However, the provision of appropriate residential facilities and services to assist these children and facilitate their reintegration into their communities will continue to be a priority. In this regard, the National Children's Office, through the working group, will be monitoring the levels of existing places provision and the plans for the delivery of the new and refurbished residential services, including the new detention centres already approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of care and custodial places for children, the following is the position. Capital investment of approximately &euro;38.09 million is being made possible by the Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places and to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or foster-care services. The health boards have informed me that the number of high support and special care places and individual high support packages identified by health boards for such children has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 94. Sixty-two of these places are currently occupied. An additional 41 high support and special care places are planned as follows: in the eastern region a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane is nearing completion; the Midland Health Board, North-Eastern Health Board, North-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus in Castleblaney; and the Mid-Western Health Board will be providing five special care places for adolescent boys on behalf of the Southern Region &ndash; Mid-Western Health Board, Southern Health Board and the South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; in a purpose-built facility which is nearing completion. Places in these facilities are due to become available in mid-2002.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has statutory responsibility for the provision of residential places for children up to the age of 16 years who are referred by the courts. There are five young offender centres under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science, which are as follows: Trinity House, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Oberstown Boys Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Oberstown Girls Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre, Kildonan Road, <Col N="1255" /> Finglas west, Dublin 11; and St. Joseph's Special School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>These centres provide residential accommodation for up to 162 children, including 31 remand places. The current operational capacity is 132 places. The operational capacity of these centres will fluctuate from time to time to facilitate refurbishment and new developments. In addition, capacity is also reduced where a centre is required to make special arrangements in order to cater for a particularly difficult child.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is currently implementing a major capital development plan in the young offender centres to ensure that the centres meet obligations that will arise under the Children Act, 2001, in addition to ensuring that they meet modern child care standards. This will result in a total of 181 places for young offenders. The Department has also commissioned an independent review of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this review is to ensure that there are sufficient residential places available to meet the needs of the target group in the short, medium and longer terms. A consultant has been appointed and it is expected that his report will be available shortly. The outcome of this review will inform future development plans in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the provision of accommodation for young offenders aged between 16 and 21 years. St. Patrick's Institution and Shanganagh Castle are specifically designated to cater for this age group and currently have a combined capacity of 299. The majority of offenders under 18 years of age are detained in these two institutions as well as in Fort Mitchel and Wheatfield prison.</P>
    <P>Under the Children Act, 2001, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 to 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. A 38 bed unit for young males in this age group with full support facilities will be provided on a dedicated site adjacent to Cork prison. Preliminary site works have commenced and a tender competition is being run for the accommodation and ancillary facilities. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform expects building work to commence later this year. A facility will also be provided in the Dublin area for 110 offenders aged 16 and 17 years &ndash; 90 males and 20 females.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the Government's commitment to ensuring the widest possible coverage for contributory pensions, in recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme. The reduction in 1997 in the average yearly number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to ten was particularly significant in this regard.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were also introduced to cater for particular groups who would not otherwise qualify for a pension. These include the special pension introduced in budget 2000 for those with pre-1953 insurance and the self-employed pension introduced in 1999. In both cases, at least five years' contributions are required and the pension is paid at 50% of the full personal, qualified adult and child rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People whose incomes are below the thresholds for compulsory social insurance may in some circumstances register to become voluntary contributors. In order to be admitted into the <Col N="1262" /> social insurance scheme as a voluntary contributor, a person must have at least 126 weeks PRSI paid under compulsory insurance &ndash; 260 from April 2002 &ndash; in either employment or self-employment. In addition, the person must apply to become a voluntary contributor within 12 months after the end of the contribution year during which he or she last paid compulsory insurance or during which he or she was last awarded a credited contribution &ndash;&ldquo;credit&rdquo;. Also, the person must agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week after the week in which he or she ceases compulsory insurance.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for a person who reaches pension age without sufficient contributions to retrospectively pay voluntary contributions in order to qualify for a pension at that stage.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is reasonable to expect people to attain a certain level of contributions over their working career in order to qualify for a contributory-based pension. From an equity perspective, a certain contribution threshold must apply. This not only upholds the social insurance principle, but also affirms the expectations and entitlements of those who have a history of strong attachment to social insurance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of information provision, my Department regularly produces up-dated publications that outline the contribution requirements for contributory pensions. It can be quite difficult to identify possible voluntary contributors. My Department is considering several mechanisms of identifying this group at present in order to supply them with the most up-to-date information on the scheme.</P>

Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate a completion date at this stage. However, I assure the Deputy that the application is receiving attention in the Land Registry.</P>

    <P>The Land Registry Office is organised into the seven regions set out in Table 3. Within each region there is no difference in the turnaround times between counties. A number of factors contribute to the variations between regions. These include: (1) the ready availability of original documents for copying and certification. Circumstances that influence this include: the layout in the building from where a county or region is served. In some buildings it is possible to store the original documents adjacent to the area where they are required &ndash; this is not possible in others; the level of development of technology for the county; the demand for the service at a given time; the resources to meet that demand at any given time; (2) the quality of the original maps; (3) in the case of filed plans it is significant whether or not a filed plan map already exists. If it does not a copy has to be prepared manually, which delays the overall process; (4) in the case of copy instruments the size and nature of the original instrument is a factor. An instrument can vary in size from a few pages to many thousands of pages. Each page has to be individually copied before it can be certified and issued, which is a very labour-intensive activity; (5) whether the applications are made via the electronic access service or by another method.</P>
    <P>The above table provides the &ldquo;average&rdquo; time taken for each of the above categories. The figures have been calculated by taking the total number of cases on hands for each category and dividing it by the average daily output in the county-region. It should be noted that, in many cases, the turnaround time is considerably faster and in some, for the reasons outlined above, it can be slower.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry Office's electronic access service &ndash; EAS &ndash; is currently available for 20 counties and will be rolled out to the remaining counties on 29 April 2002. Where applications are made via this system it is much more efficient for the Land Registry Office to process them. The usage of the EAS system, which has been introduced on a gradual basis, is extremely good. Over 3,300 customers have now opened accounts. At present, for the counties where it is available, over 50% of applications are being made elec<Col N="1266" /> tronically. In the case of an application for a certified copy folio or a copy folio and filed plan where the folio is held in electronic format and a filed plan already exists, it issues within 48 hours when the application is made via the EAS system. At present, about 25% of the 1.8 million Land Registry Office folios are held in electronic format. It is intended to have all the folios and all the filed plan maps converted to electronic format by the end of 2004.</P>

      <P>My Department has statutory responsibility for the provision of residential places for children up to the age of 16 years who are referred by the courts. There are five young offender centres under the aegis of my Department providing residential accommodation for up to 162 children and a programme to upgrade and modernise these facilities is under way. They are: Trinity House, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Oberstown Boys Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Oberstown Girls Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre, Kildonan Road, Finglas west, Dublin 11; and St. Joseph's Special School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>Trinity House school is the only secure facility operated by my Department providing 24 places for children in a secure setting and three places in a pre-release unit. A new highly specialised secure unit to cater for an additional six children is being developed at Trinity House, which will bring the total number of places available at Trinity House to 33 by mid-2003.</P>
      <P>The young offender centres provide programmes of care, education, training and rehabilitation for children on an individual basis designed to challenge their offending behaviour, develop relationships and build self-esteem. There is a special national school attached to each centre providing a range of suitable programmes in accordance with the primary school curriculum and adaptations of the post-primary syllabi. A designated Department of Education and Science inspector of schools visits and reports on each school. A range of after-school programmes in training and rehabilitation are in place in each centre and these are reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" />The Government's commitment to children at risk is evidenced by the measures contained in the Children Act, 2001. It proposes a modern statutory framework for the development of the juvenile justice system. In addition to updating the provisions relating to young persons who have been sentenced by the courts, including the obligations of the centres under the aegis of my Department, the legislation will provide for a wide range of early interventions and non-custodial alternatives to cater for children coming into conflict with the law or with serious care needs. It also provides for the establishment of the Special Residential Services Board. The Special Residential Services Board will work in close co-operation with all relevant bodies to facilitate and ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom children detention orders or special care orders are made.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has commissioned an independent review of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this review is to ensure that there are sufficient residential places available to meet the needs of the target group in the short, medium and longer terms. A consultant has been appointed and it is expected that his report will be available shortly. The outcome of this review will inform future development plans in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I launched the new disadvantage programme &ndash; Giving Children An Even Break &ndash; last year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will run over a three year period and will cost some &euro;33 million. Giving Children An Even Break involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to 2,143 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools, carried out in March and April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf.</P>
      <P>Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and financial supports, to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, will retain their entitlements under that scheme. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school referred to by the Deputy is benefiting from a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in all classes and has the services of a home-school-community liaison co-ordinator. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee. The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children An Even Break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its commencement, schools in Giving Children An Even Break that are categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to <Col N="1272" /> implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes. From 1 September 2002 the maximum class size in senior classes will be reduced from 29:1 to 27:1 in these selected schools in addition to schools included in the urban dimension of Breaking the Cycle.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>The mainstream staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the education partners.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 503 pupils. This warrants a staffing of a principal and 18 mainstream class teachers for the 2002-2003 school year.</P>

      <P>An application was received in the planning section of my Department in October 1999 for an extension to the existing school building referred to by the Deputy. The application was examined at that time and it was concluded that the projected long-term enrolment for the school <Col N="1273" /> would reach 650 pupils. This figure was based on statistics relating to future output from primary schools in the catchment area and on enrolment trends in the post-primary school in question.</P>
      <P>The school authorities were informed of the outcome of this examination and subsequently applied to have the figure reviewed on the basis of impact of current and future housing developments on long-term school enrolments.</P>
      <P>The planning section is reviewing the most appropriate way to provide long-term post-primary education in the Athlone centre. Officials of the Department are liaising with Westmeath County Council regarding housing development proposals for the Athlone area with a view to determining how this will impact on schools in Athlone. When this review has been completed my Department will be in contact with the school authorities of Our Lady's Bower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvan<Col N="1274" /> taged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: (a) the higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; (d) maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate &ndash; PLC &ndash; courses. All four schemes have similar provisions relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant are being reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the <Col N="1275" /> implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million &ndash; £1.964 million &ndash; in respect of the 2000-2001 academic year to &euro;7.49 million &ndash; £5.9 million &ndash; in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: (a) the higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; (d) maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate &ndash; PLC &ndash; courses. All four schemes have similar provisions relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant are being reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a separate measure also aimed at promoting access to third level education I announced, in September 2000, a millennium partnership fund for disadvantage with a provision of &euro;1.2697 mill<Col N="1279" /> ion &ndash; £1 million &ndash; in 2001. The fund is intended to build on the experience of the support scheme for students from disadvantaged families, operated by the Northside Partnership, which assists students to participate in higher education.</P>
    <P>The report of the action group on access, which I launched in July 2001, sets out detailed recommendations on the criteria that should apply in the disbursement of the fund.</P>
    <P>Area Development Management Limited, ADM, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-2002 academic year and the partnerships and community groups, under ADM, were invited to apply for funding in the initial year. For the 2001-2002 academic year, 35 partnerships and community groups received allocations from the fund.</P>
    <P>The action group also recommended that other organisations focused on the needs of particular sectors among the disadvantaged target groups should also be eligible to apply. This recommendation will be considered in the context of the disbursement of the fund in 2002 in respect of the 2002-2003 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the management authorities of schools request parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any children in the school. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils it is possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place, to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers an anaphylactic reaction, appropriate treatment is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is due to the type of case referred to by the Deputy that the administration of medicines in school is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisations representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures <Col N="1281" /> that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so.</P>
    <P>It is this Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the board of management and teachers of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to administer the type of medicine which may be required in cases such as those referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>There has been a major increase in the last two years in the level of additional teaching resources made available by my Department to schools in order to assist them in catering for children with special educational needs. This intervention has provided very significant additional educational support from suitably qualified teachers in schools across the country.</P>
      <P>These additional appointments, however, bring with them the need for additional training in the special needs area. Due to the large numbers involved this matter is being addressed in a systematic way. Where in-career development training is being provided, full-time permanent teachers working with special needs pupils receive this training in the first instance. This is a priority. At present, the inclusion of part-time teachers on in-career training is considered in the light of available places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department issued two copies of the post-primary resource materials for relationships and sexuality education for junior cycle to every second level school in 1998. These materials were designed for use by RSE teachers and not for students' use. An error in the materials was brought to the attention of my Department within the past two weeks. Immediate steps were taken to have the matter clarified. In view of the very complex legal issues involved, the Department sought the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General has now provided the Department with the following advice. The age of consent given in the materials was 16 for heterosexual sex and 17 for homosexual sex. I can now confirm, on the advice of the Attorney General, that for heterosexual sexual intercourse, 17 years is the age of consent for girls and 15 years for boys. For homosexual sexual intercourse, it is 17 years for boys and girls. The courts are bound to deal with the issue of age of consent in cases of alleged rape or sexual assault as it is defined in <Col N="1286" /> criminal legislation rather than in other forms of information which do not amount to an interpretation of the law.</P>
    <P>As with all such guidelines, the RSE resource materials for junior cycle were prepared following an extensive consultative process involving all the education partners. All suggestions and proposed amendments were considered carefully in a rigorous vetting process before the documents were issued to schools in 1998. Throughout this process, the issue regarding the age of consent was not raised and the materials issued to schools. Subsequent to this, the matter now receiving attention was not addressed by the Department.</P>
    <P>A letter has been drafted for immediate issue to management authorities and principals of all second level schools and groups to whom the materials were sent to clarify the matter. Steps are also being taken to have the documents in circulation amended. The materials are now out of print and a re-print, which is scheduled for late summer, will have the correct information included.</P>
    <P>In writing to schools, my Department is requesting that principals consult with teachers who have engaged in the delivery of RSE classes from the academic years 1998-99 onwards to establish if the age of consent was raised with students during these classes. Where this was the case, my Department is requesting that steps should be taken by the school to ensure that students still in the school are immediately informed of the correct position. For the students concerned who are no longer in the school, my Department will make a letter of clarification available to schools in order that a written copy of the legal position regarding the age of consent can be forwarded.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the percentage of second-level schools which currently have a library; the staff allocations which he has made for staffing school libraries; the proposals for extending library and staffing provision for schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not have details of the number of schools with library facilities. However, where new schools are being built or where existing schools are undergoing major refurbishment and/or extension at post primary level provision is made for a library of 100 metres squared in schools with an enrolment of 200-499 students and 136 metres squared in schools with more than 500 students. Schools below 200 are examined individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in recent years two grants have issued post primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource <Col N="1287" /> materials. The first grant was called a library grant and was issued by my Department in December 1998 which amounted to £2,500, while disadvantaged schools received £5,320.</P>
    <P>A second grant issued to all post primary schools in December 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Post-primary schools received £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £1,540 was paid to all schools with less than 200 recognised pupils. At second level the two grants amounted to £5.2 million.</P>
    <P>My Department provides funding towards staffing in second level schools by means of per capita grants. In this regard significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to second level schools. The standard <i>per capita </i>grant from &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to &euro;256.49 in this school year, and will be further significantly increased by &euro;10 for the next school year to &euro;266.49. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total <i>per capita</i> grant in the case of such schools to over &euro;300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools will benefit from further significant increases in the support grant from &euro;25.40 per pupil to &euro;99.04 per pupil over this school year and the next. This funding may be used towards general expenses or towards the provision of additional support services including secretarial, caretaking or library staff.</P>
    <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures that are designed to reduce historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. I recently announced a major equalisation measure for voluntary secondary schools. Under the terms of this measure, the support services grant will be increased by &euro;28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This will bring the support services grant in the case of secondary schools to &euro;116.88 per pupil from September next and to &euro;127.04 per pupil from 1 January next. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school &ndash;&euro;44.44 per pupil &ndash; per annum that was approved for secondary schools last December.</P>
    <P>For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to &euro;100,000 per annum, and annual grants of up to &euro;236,761 &ndash;&euro;255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools &ndash; towards general expenses and support services.</P>
    <P>As individual school authorities are best placed to assess their staffing requirements, the funding provided under the schools support services fund is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which support services are provided.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of this school on 30 September 2001 was 207 pupils which warrants a staffing of a principal and seven mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year. The school also has the services of a shared learning support teacher based at the school. I have requested officials of my Department to examine the staffing position in the school.</P>

      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for the national educational psychological service agency, NEPS, recommended an overall target number of 200 psychologists. It also recommended that this target should be achieved by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>When I opened the new NEPS headquarters in May 2000, there were 43 psychologists employed in the agency. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of competitions through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are now almost 100 psychologists deployed in the education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission has recently concluded the selection of additional psychologists for NEPS. It is envisaged that many of them will be in post by the end of this school year. The notice for candidates in this competition has specified the regions where there are substantial numbers of vacancies. NEPS psychologists who are already in post have also been invited to apply for transfer to the <Col N="1291" /> north west. By the beginning of the next school year, a number of appointments will have been made to the north west region.</P>
    <P>I also announced recently that the Government <Col N="1292" /> has decided to enable the full complement of 200 NEPS psychologists to be appointed by the end of this year, two years ahead of schedule. Once this has been achieved, NEPS will be able to offer its service to all schools in all regions.</P>
