      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of extreme urgency, locally and nationally, the need for the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to intervene to prevent a threatened all-out strike by SIPTU members of Clare health services arising from the suspension without pay of three receptionists who were transferred from Our Lady's Hospital to Ennis General Hospital and the need for the Minister to make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31, I seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, the serious threat to postal delivery services in many parts of the country as a result of the decision of the Irish Postmasters Union to ballot its members on intensified industrial action and the need for Government intervention to secure a settlement of the dispute.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to No. 17, which provides for the extension of freedom of information obligations to a number of new bodies, but I wish to ask the Minister whether the National Development Finance Agency Bill, which is on today's Order Paper, will be included under freedom of information obligations. We probably will not get another opportunity to extend its remit, given that the legislation does not provide for this. This is an agency to whose workings the House and the public will want to have access via freedom of information legislation.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Tánaiste about the Government's legislative programme on justice, equality and law reform. Last week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform revealed figures which show that the number of violent assaults in Dublin is now five times what it was three years ago. This year's figures, which have just been released, are appalling. The Minister also released his Estimates which show far from zero tolerance; they show zero provision for the Garda next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

      <P>I wish to ask the Tánaiste about legislation pertaining to her Department. In her contribution on the Estimates yesterday, she made much play of increased funding for the Science Foundation Ireland Fund in spite of a 5% cut in the overall Estimate. When will the Industrial Development Science Foundation Ireland Bill be before the House? She announced in her contribution that she intended to bring in a revised scheme of fees before the House in relation to work permits. Is the work permit Bill being proceeded with? Does the Tánaiste intend reducing the amount of work permits and when will we have a chance to debate the Government's intention in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in presenting the National Development Finance Agency Bill, 2002. The Bill is an integral element in the Government's determination to ensure that all available sources of funding are utilised for infrastructural projects, including private finance.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a national development finance agency, the NDFA, under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency to assist in providing cost effective finance for public investment projects. The agency will be staffed by experts with relevant experience, for example, in corporate finance and risk assessment. The NDFA will help to maximise value for money for the Exchequer in a number of ways, including the identification of the best financing packages and the application of commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risks and costs for each project.</P>
      <P>In addition to maximising value for money for the Exchequer, the functions of the NDFA will include: providing advice to State authorities, including Government Departments, to assist them in evaluating financial risks and costs of infrastructure projects and facilitating them in availing of the best financing package for each project; assessing optimal financing for major infrastructure projects set out in the national development plan and other infrastructure priorities; and, in some circumstances, raising finance for projects including certain design, build, operate and finance public private partnerships where this would be more cost effective than private funding and, in respect of conventionally procured capital projects, where there are clear benefits offsetting any increased cost of agency funding over Exchequer funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the provision of advice, PPP projects are complex, requiring expert technical, legal and financial advice. A centrally resourced expert advisory service to all State authorities would be more economic than employing experts in each of these areas in every procuring authority, including the local authorities. This role can be filled by the NDFA in respect of financial <Col N="1526" /> advice. In this way significant cost savings could be achieved over time.</P>
    <P>The NDFA will help to maximise value for money for the Exchequer by identifying the best financing packages and by applying commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risks and costs for each project. In order to assess the optimal means of financing projects, the NDFA will acquire the expertise to assess the relative merits of different project structures such as traditional procurement, design, build and operate &ndash; DBO &ndash; PPPs and privately financed PPPs. It will be a part of the NDFA's role to advise procuring Departments and agencies as to the appropriate financial structure and to evaluate proposals submitted by the private sector. This will assist procuring authorities by applying commercial standards in terms of evaluating risks and costs associated with projects. Prospectuses and invitations to tender will make it clear that the NDFA will be involved in assessing and advising on proposals and where appropriate will reserve the light to accept or reject any particular financing package and instead to utilise funds provided by the NDFA. The objective will be to ensure overall best value for money and encouraging the maximum private sector involvement in financing projects.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that State authorities will be obliged to seek NDFA advice. However, an important consideration is that they are not obliged to take it. The final decision on the structure and financing of a project remains a matter for the appropriate Minister, or where there is delegated sanction, the appropriate accounting officer or equivalent. The legislation also provides that after consultation with other Ministers, I will issue guidance on the circumstances in which NDFA advice should be sought &ndash; taking account of the type of project or programme of projects, stage of development of a project and any other relevant factors, and the need to comply with procurement rules and avoid conflict of interest. This guidance will be drafted with input from a cross-departmental team which will include a representative of the Office of the Attorney General in an advisory rather than executive capacity. The NDFA will also be consulted.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the benefits of NDFA will include maximising value for money by: identifying the best financing packages; applying commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risks and costs for each project; in instances where private sector finance is unsuitable, raising finance itself or via SPCs; and centralising commercial expertise, thereby reducing dependence on external consultants with consequent cost savings.</P>
    <P>Where the NDFA is able to borrow at better rates than the private sector, less State subvention may be required for capital projects underpinning the PPP approach to the delivery of infrastructure. It is intended that NDFA financing will be backed by Government guarantee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" />The general Government balance or GGB is an EU measure of state finance which includes any non-Exchequer financing which the state, or state organisations, discharge. It is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact in the context of the Maastricht treaty. The impact of NDFA financing on the GGB would depend on the nature of the projects being financed and ultimately on rulings by EUROSTAT.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill will provide powers to enable the establishment of special purpose companies or SPCs to give the NDFA additional options in raising moneys on the most beneficial terms for relevant projects. Section 5 provides that the NDFA may itself form an SPC or cause it to be formed; that SPCs are for financing purposes only; that the consent of the Minister for Finance must be obtained in writing before each company is formed; that SPCs will not have a Government guarantee; and that there will be no recourse to the Exchequer or to any State authority.</P>
    <P>The possible use of SPCs offers the following benefits: the optimal financing structure can be put in place to raise the money to invest in a project such as a bridge, tunnel, etc., with hard tolls where private sector financing packages are not sufficiently attractive; and key concerns of investors &ndash; for example, the debt repayment capacity of the borrower and the risk that the cash flows may be diverted to another party &ndash; can be addressed. Where the cash flows are sufficient to service the debt the best way to insulate them and give maximum protection to investors-lenders is to form an SPC as the financing vehicle for the project. This SPC would raise the moneys for the project and have priority rights to the cash flows, e.g. tolls. Such an SPC would not get involved in any other projects. Therefore, investors would have more confidence that their investment would be repaid. In return, the SPC should be able to raise the moneys on better terms &ndash; that is, a lower cost of borrowing.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation imposes rigorous corporate governance requirements regarding areas such as disclosure of interests and disclosure of confidential information. The Bill also provides that the chief executive officer and the chairperson of the NDFA shall, whenever required by the Committee of Public Accounts, give evidence to that committee.</P>
    <P>It is a stated aim of the Government that the NDFA should have a critical role in developing the best means of financing a wide range of public sector investment projects in a manner that is flexible and responsive to the needs of our economy. The projects will include infrastructure projects and programmes under the NDP.</P>
    <P>Of particular importance will be the role of the NDFA in underpinning the development of PPPs. There are already in excess of 40 PPP projects at various stages of procurement and, where the key <Col N="1528" /> objectives of value for money and deliverability are met, these numbers may expand over the next few years. Again it is important to remember that under the Government's approach, and in contrast to the PFI in the UK, PPPs in Ireland include design, build and operate projects where there has never been any prospect of private finance. Accordingly, it is wholly realistic to envisage a substantial level of NDFA activity in relation to the future development of PPPs even before other types of projects are addressed. I see the NDFA having a pivotal role in applying lessons learned from the initial pilot PPP projects to the financing of future projects. Achieving value for money for the Exchequer is one of the central aims of the PPP programme and the application of the best available financing arrangements to PPP projects is an essential element in delivering economy, efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>While the Bill will be discussed in detail by members on Committee Stage I will describe some of its important specific provisions. Section 1 is a standard interpretation section containing definitions of certain words and phrases used throughout the Bill. Section 2 provides for the establishment of the agency as a body corporate on a day to be appointed by order by the Minister for Finance. Achieving value for money for the Exchequer is one of the central aims of the PPP programme and the application of the best available financing arrangements to PPP projects is an essential element in delivering economy, efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>While the Bill will be discussed in detail by members on Committee Stage I will describe some of its important specific provisions. Section 1 is a standard section containing definitions of certain words and phrases used throughout the Bill. Section 2 provides for the establishment of the agency as a body corporate on a day to be appointed by order by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the key section which sets out in precise form the functions of the agency. The section provides that the functions of the agency will be to advise any State authority on the optimal means of financing major public investment projects, including PPP arrangements, in order to achieve value for money; to advance repayable loans, including equity, and enter into other financial arrangements regarding projects approved by any State authority; to provide advice to State authorities on all aspects of the financing, including refinancing and insurance, of major PPP projects; and form companies subject to section 5 for the purpose of securing finance for public investment projects.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that, in the provision of advice, the agency must take into account any policy directions regarding financing of major public investment projects or detailed policy guidance in relation to the process, procedures and regulation generally of PPPs issued by the Minister for Finance to State authorities. Any advice given under the Act shall be independent <Col N="1529" /> of any potential benefits to the agency or the NTMA.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the agency may form special purpose companies &ndash; SPCs &ndash; in order to provide finance where it is the opinion of the agency that this is necessary or expedient in order to discharge its functions under the legislation. The formation of such companies must have the prior written consent of the Minister for Finance in respect of each project. SPCs set up under this section can borrow money. The section provides that no guarantee, loan or subvention will be given to any company established under this section by the Minister, the agency, the National Treasury Management Agency or any State authority or other State body. No liability shall attach to the State in respect of any act done by a company established under this section or in the winding up of such a company.</P>
    <P>Section 6 authorises the agency to borrow moneys in any currency subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance and stipulates that the aggregate of the sums borrowed, guaranteed and outstanding by the agency cannot exceed &euro;5 billion. The agency will have the power to effect contracts in order to fix, eliminate or reduce the risk of loss from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the cost of borrowing or other transactions carried out in the course of that business. In addition, the agency can open and maintain bank accounts.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister for Finance may guarantee the due repayment by the agency of the principal of any moneys and-or the payment of interest on such moneys borrowed by the agency. The Minister for Finance must give the Houses of the Oireachtas an annual statement with respect to each guarantee setting out certain specified particulars. Any moneys paid by the Minister for Finance under a guarantee must be repaid, to the Minister within two years. If not repaid, these will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Any payment by the Minister under this section will be a charge on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out that State authorities, in accordance with any guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance, must seek the advice of the agency on the financing of public investment projects. Section 9 specifies that the agency shall perform its functions through the National Treasury Management Agency and accordingly provides for the appropriate amendment to the National Treasury Management Act 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the board of the agency, which will consist of a chairperson &ndash; who will be the chief executive officer of the National Treasury Management Agency &ndash; and four ordinary members, shall ensure that the functions of the agency are being performed effectively, set the objectives and targets to be met by the agency and ensure they are carried out. The Minister for Finance will appoint the ordinary members for a term of office of five years. Other matters relating to board members such as remuneration and <Col N="1530" /> allowances for expenses, terms relating to holding office and the disqualification, resignation or removal from membership of the board are also dealt with in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the appointment by the board of the chief executive officer of the agency. Section 12 provides for the holding of meetings by the board, the first of which will be on the establishment day of the agency. It also specifies details such as the quorum, who should chair meetings, voting rules, and the procedure and business of meetings. Section 13 provides that the agency shall have a seal and sets out who may authenticate the seal. Judicial notice will be taken of the seal. It also lists those who may enter into and execute any contract or instrument not requiring to be under seal.</P>
    <P>Section 14 stipulates that a member of the board cannot be a member of either House of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or a local authority, vocational educational committee, health board, or the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that a member of the board or staff of the agency or a consultant, adviser or other person engaged by the agency must disclose any interest in any matter, in advance of any consideration of that matter by the board or the agency and cannot influence a decision or take part in consideration of that matter. Any such disclosure is to be recorded in the minutes of the meeting of the board or otherwise recorded by the chief executive officer. The section also sets out in what situations a person can and cannot be regarded as having a beneficial interest. If a member of the board contravenes these disclosure provisions the Minister for Finance will decide the appropriate action to be taken, including removal from office. If a member of staff of the agency or a consultant, adviser or other person engaged by the agency contravenes the disclosure provisions the chairperson will decide the appropriate action to be taken. The section also provides that the agency shall issue and publish guidelines as to what constitutes an interest.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for a prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of confidential information and a person who contravenes this shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for a prohibition on communications for the purpose of improper influence with a person guilty of an offence under this section being liable to a fine or imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Section 18 requires the agency to keep accounts in such form as may be determined by the Minister for Finance and specifies certain details in relation to borrowing and fundraising by the agency and its transfer to individual projects, which must be included in the accounts. The audited accounts must be copied to the Minister and laid before each House of the Oireachtas and must note a record of expenses incurred by the agency. The section also provides for an amend<Col N="1531" /> ment to the National Treasury Management Act 1990 to the effect that the audited accounts of the National Treasury Management Agency shall note a record of expenses incurred by that agency in the exercise of its functions under this Bill. The chief executive officer and the chairperson must, when required, give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts on specified matters.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the making of a report by the agency to the Minister for Finance not later than six months after the end of each financial year in relation to its activities during that year. Section 20 provides for the amendment of the Schedule to the Act. Section 21 is a standard provision to the effect that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that administrative expenses of the agency will be charged on the Central Fund, that expenses incurred in the performance of its financing functions will be recovered by repayments on loans advanced by the agency and that expenses incurred in relation to advisory functions will be recovered by a charge on the Vote of the appropriate Department. Section 23 provides for the Short Title to the Bill. The Schedule lists the State authorities covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's aim to establish this new agency which will have a critical role in developing the best means of financing public investment. The NDFA will advise sponsoring agencies such as Departments, local authorities or statutory bodies on the optimal means of financing major infrastructure projects; it will provide ongoing financial advice as projects are procured and in certain circumstances the NDFA will raise finance for projects. The purpose of the agency is to deliver value for money for the Exchequer by facilitating the best financial arrangements for projects. This, in turn, will assist in the delivery of key elements of the NDP and other infrastructure priorities. My aim is to have NDFA operational by 1 January 2003.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot offer the Minister my support for this Bill. The national development plan is a shambles. The delivery of projects is behind schedule and there have been massive cost overruns. The recent report of the roads plan showed a 66% overrun in the cost of the roads programme. We have seen delays caused by poor planning and as a result of land bottlenecks. There are serious problems of stop-go funding. In last week's Estimates the Minister decided to cut productive infrastructure investment by 17% in real terms. As a result it is impossible for project managers to manage their projects efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capability of the Government to manage this programme must be seriously questioned. Taxpayers are making a heavy investment but the Ministers and their advisers are not delivering the <Col N="1532" /> product. That is the issue. &ldquo;Where is the beef?&rdquo;, is the question.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to be seen to be doing something and that in itself is encouraging, but this is not tackling the real problem. Any objective assessment of the real problem with the NDP will say it is the lack of a durable plan and a clear commitment to carry it through. That has not been evident from Government. We are nearly at the half way stage of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and we still do not have any spatial strategy that would tie the projects together and achieve the necessary consistency, coherence and concerted roll-out with a real Government commitment.</P>
    <P>The delivery of projects is sloppy. The Minister has allowed different Departments to sloppily monitor the physical projects and that is evident from the comments on the NDP by the consultants employed. There has been sloppy control of over-runs and sloppy monitoring of costs. Everything about this has represented slippage. There is continuous slippage backwards and it has become the order of the day.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister is deafeningly silent about one of his most interesting financial projects, namely, the establishment of the national pensions fund. I fully support him in putting money into that fund but I cannot support the advanced form of lunacy demonstrated by the decision to borrow over &euro;1 billion next year to put into foreign stock markets and equities, at a time when our infrastructure is groaning for the want of funds. It is lunacy given that we are sacrificing jobs as a result of congestion costs and the lack of a proper roads and telecommunications infrastructure. The Minister is propping up employment in the foreign exchanges of Frankfurt and Tokyo and bringing funds to bear on the Nikkei and other indices we hear about every morning as we come into work.</P>
    <P>The Minister obviously wants to see the pensions fund enjoying long-term returns as a result of investment. He is talking about tolling assets and related charges, but surely, if the public has to face these, the money should go into a fund that will ultimately benefit the people. This Bill is poorly thought out. It is not addressing the core problems and should be set aside until we get a more robust assessment of what has gone wrong with the NDP and what are the best ways forward.</P>
    <P>There are three elements to the successful delivery of infrastructural projects &ndash; sound project choice, cost-effective funding, and the efficient and speedy design, building and operation of projects. Of these three the Minister is addressing only one. He will admit that the greatest problems in the public sector have not come from a lack of cost-effective funding. The Government is extremely efficient at raising finance. The NTMA does a good job in keeping down the cost of finance. That is not where the problem is arising in the delivery of the NDP.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" />The delivery of the NDP is hampered in many cases by poor project choice, which we have seen in respect of Stadium Ireland. I have never seen a project so poorly analysed or appraised before it got enthusiastic support &ndash; not from the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, but he had to acquiesce in the folly of others. The other reason why the public policy is going wildly off track is its inability to deliver efficient and speedy building, design and operation of projects. The problem lies in the management of projects, not in their financing. That is something the Minister has overlooked. I think he knows it in his heart, but he is bound by some manifesto commitment to go ahead with this.</P>
    <P>The sole focus of this Bill is on funding, and that is not an area where there is any potential for big savings, nor is it the area in which the private sector has most to offer the public sector in terms of insight. The private sector has most to offer in the areas of design, building and operation, and if we are to look for private sector insight we should look for it in regard to those areas.</P>
    <P>I presume some of the projects the Minister is considering have no income stream and some have a potential income stream. As far as the ones with no income stream are concerned, the funding is just like raising a mortgage. Why should we be considering going to the private sector to raise funding to set up some companies, or SPCs as the Minister is calling them, when we know the Government is the most efficient raiser of public funding? It has the best credit rating and will not have private sector commissions or add-ons to pay. Clearly, there are few circumstances in which it pays the State to go for private sector funding of effectively mortgage-type investments.</P>
    <P>The only circumstances where that would be an option do not require an agency. These are simply arrangements whereby one leases a building instead of buying it. The Office of Public Works has been doing that for years and I have not heard anyone suggest that it is not good at getting cost-effective leases as an alternative to buying. The alternative is that one lets the private sector build the building and one rents it. That is not an option for schools and it would not make any sense in that regard. One knows that the school and the State will be committed to the project for eternity so there is no advantage in opting for these arrangements over State investment and funding of the project.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents the back door to some poor decision making because the agency will have to justify itself. Its justification will be to show it is raising funds, even if the fundraising projects in which it engages are not appropriate.</P>
    <P>The second types of projects are those where there is a potential income stream and where private sector funding may do more than simply substitute for the cheap fund-raising capacity of the Minister and his advisers and may add some value over and above just adding its commissions. These projects involve a genuine transfer of risk <Col N="1534" /> to the private sector. The Minister has a short-term incentive to want to shift risk to the private sector to evade the stability pact. That is a flaw in the stability pact. If the Minister is being forced by the regulations of the stability pact to make stupid decisions about private sources of funding and the transfer of risk to the private sector that should remain in the public sector, that demonstrates a problem with the stability pact.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister go to his colleagues in Europe &ndash; where there seems to be a willingness to address the issue &ndash; and say that the 3% is unrealistic for countries that require major development and that to address infrastructural deficits we need a more realistic system for controlling fiscal responsibility. Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, has indicated that there is a willingness to reconsider. I would rather hear the Minister say that he will try to create a better system so we can fund our projects in a cost-effective way rather than setting up a new quango to do stunts that we in this House will find extremely difficult to track. Otherwise we will lose some of our responsibility in holding Ministers accountable for what they are doing on the capital side.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient or robust enough a reason to evade the stability pact to take the sort of funding approach the Minister is talking about. There must be good public policy reasons to do so as well. I have not heard the Minister articulate the good public policy reasons. I have heard him talk about cheaper money, about which I would be dubious. I would like to see good public policy reasons coming from the Minister as to why projects should be put into the private sector.</P>
    <P>There are undoubtedly circumstances where a project transferred to the private sector can achieve more market orientation of customers, better management of revenues and more efficient design, building and operation. Harbours are a good example. I see a future in that sort of thing. However, we must be extremely careful in selecting the projects. The Bill offers no public policy guidelines as to when it is right to select private sector funding. Projects that might appear superficially to be good candidates for private sector funding may not be so.</P>
    <P>An example that the Minister would know very well relates to commercial pricing. This will not always be appropriate for the use of a public asset. A town bypass is a perfect example. For example, if the Kilcock bypass is tolled it will create an incentive for people to continue to go through the town rather than use the bypass. It is only sensible to toll bypasses if there are capacity constraints. If the public has funded such projects it makes no sense to create obstacles to their use. Tolling should only arise for sound public policy reasons, for example, to deal with congestion.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that tolling charges may be imposed for wrong public policy reasons. There are good reasons for having zero cost on the use of public transport at off-peak times when buses <Col N="1535" /> travel virtually empty because there is a strong social case to get people to opt for buses rather than cars. However, if the bus services are to be run under PPP arrangements, private operators will seek tolls and will charge the necessary fares even if the result is fewer passengers. It means the imposition of social costs to protect private revenue. There is no evidence of any thinking on this issue in the Bill. The proposed agency will accept advice in this area in the absence of guidelines from the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a need to be careful about whether the risk is genuinely being transferred by PPPs or whether the State will remain the risk bearer of last resort. For example, if the State decides to pull private money into a hospital or prison and things go wrong, the private developers will require control of the revenue stream and the asset, otherwise they will not get involved. They must secure their money and will have a lien on the asset. It means they will cut their losses and close down the project. It would be unthinkable for the Government to close a prison or a hospital, so when things go wrong the Government will have to intervene and pay way over the odds to rescue a struggling project. Examples of this have occurred in France. The Minister knows better than I that rescue packages will always be much more expensive. He has often railed against rescue activity in the past. In many projects the State will act as risk taker of last resort. There is no indication that the proposed agency will be empowered to assess the risks involved as no provisions in the Bill deal with public policy considerations of this kind.</P>
    <P>Good public policy dictates that there should be no automatic combination of funding of a project &ndash; with the implied lien on assets &ndash; with the management of different elements, where private sector efficiencies may be obtained. Other options are available. Management contracts could be agreed in areas where the private sector can achieve efficiency. For example, Irish management tradition in the health services has not been good and a strong case could be made, one which I support, for piloting and testing to see if the management and running of such services can be contracted out.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill does not take this approach. By providing for the bundling of operations the State will give away its lien on assets without regard for the implications or consideration of other options. It is unclear if the proposed agency, which will comprise four members and will call on expertise in funding &ndash; essentially expertise in corporate finance &ndash; has the kind of sophistication required to make these difficult public policy decisions. The problems in the public sector arise not in the funding area, but from poor efficiency in design, building and operation arising from procedures which are too cumbersome, with the result that projects are hampered by delays and poor execution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" />The Minister gave no indication of the experiences of the 40 PPPs to which he referred. He spoke of learning from past lessons but he should tell the House what they are and why they justify the establishment of this agency. For example, will he indicate if the school projects built under PPPs provided good value for money? What premium was it deemed worth paying for the transfer of risks to the private sector and how much was paid over the odds? What are the value for money tests applied by the Minister's Department or other Departments?</P>
    <P>I understood this Bill was a pillar of An Agreed Programme for Government, yet I am sorry the Minister is leaving the House. It is an extraordinary approach. If this is his pet project he should not have to rely on second hand information about this debate. I am disappointed in his lack of respect for the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister also needs to outline if the agency will bypass the value for money tests applied to PPPs, which I understand have been articulated primarily by his Department. Is the legislation a way of getting away from the Department's hard-headed attitude? Perhaps the Minister considers Department officials are too interested in ensuring that the State secures value for the projects involved. Does it mean the agency will overlook the advice of the Department? In recent times Cabinet has overlooked its advice in many decisions especially those affecting Campus and Stadium Ireland. Will the agency be used as a back door to sanction the silly projects the Taoiseach and others have recently fostered? How will the agency fit in with the existing PPP units and agencies? Is there a strong flow of projects in the pipeline and are they robust?</P>
    <P>The Minister must make clear what he considers to be the long-term benefits of the agency in public policy terms, not just in creating a centre where there will be a great deal of advice, instead of having it in different places. That is the sort of mindless argument for setting up a brass plate on a door and bringing together all the experts, so that in five years time someone will say that it is not a good idea to have all the experts together and we should decentralise them. That is the excuse for clear thinking about policy issues that is being indulged in, in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is saying it will be down to the EU-EUROSTAT to decide which of these projects is outside and which is inside the stability pact. That means one of the big benefits of getting away from the stop-go flow of funding is gone. The original reason for the wheeze was the annual squeeze where Ministers have recklessly spent on current spending projects that results in a squeeze of capital projects which we are seeing now, which results in job losses because infrastructure dries up. The thought was that this was a clever way for the Minister to get away from the stop-go policies which his colleagues forced on him, or which he allowed them to pursue. However, this does not now appear to be the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" />I am not convinced by the centre of excellence argument because it addresses the wrong problem. I was surprised the Minister did not refer to the National Roads Authority, the Rail Procurement Authority, the Housing Finance Agency and the National Waste Management Agency. These bodies were established in recognition of the fact that local authorities are not good at building, designing and operating projects. Instead of allowing them to raise their own bonds, where funding and efficient management could be brought together under the one agency, another quango will be created with the power to raise money while the other agencies will be one step away from being able to generate the funds necessary for badly needed projects. For example, there is no merit in the establishment of a two headed monster to deal with roads. It will mean the NRA doing one thing while the proposed new agency does another. The Minister has not offered any rationalisation of the merits of that approach.</P>
    <P>I oppose Second Stage because I am concerned about the Minister's whole philosophy which underpins and I hope also to signal on Committee Stage some of my other minor concerns. The Minister established State-owned companies, the SPCs as he refers to them, with the power to raise money without State guarantee, which is a clever ploy to make these companies semi-attached to the public sector. However, will it be the taxpayer who is ultimately fooled by this ploy? Where is the accountability in these SPCs? There is no provision for their being answerable to the Public Account Committee, nor for their projects having public information and the FOI will not apply to them or to the agency. It is a black box &ndash; an act of faith. These companies will be established and receive public money in loans and tolls but we will have no access to them.</P>
    <P>The notion of having one agency as advisor and executor of finance deals does not hang together. The Minister recognised in his own speech that he was on thin ice and stated that the sponsoring Department would not be obliged to take the advice. We are making it compulsory for them to seek the advice but optional for them to take it. The Minister clearly recognises that there is an inherent conflict of interest in two jobs being put together in the one agency, but does not do enough about it. The logical follow-on is to ask why we should give monopoly powers on funding to this one agency, albeit State owned. We should tender it out so that private finance companies are given a fair chance to put together these funding packages. I suspect that there is an EU obligation for such funding to be tendered and this proposal could fall on those grounds. Establishing overlapping membership of the NTMA and the new agency is not good corporate governance, but I await the Minister's arguments on Committee Stage for this. It is not generally the approach taken towards subsidiaries by private companies.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the banning of the new agency from commenting on any hare-brained idea that <Col N="1538" /> emanates from a Minister. If this is to be a centre of excellence in funding and project management, as the Minister would have us believe, if we are to hand over public money to it, then we must hear if it has hard talking to do about mad schemes from Ministers. Instead the Minister proposes that if it appears before the Public Account Committee, its members cannot comment on Stadium Ireland and whether the benefits match the costs, which is wrong. An elected Parliament should not be treated with such contempt and preventing officials, who are responsible for putting together financial packages, from expressing strong views to the Oireachtas is foolish. The Minister is attempting to circumscribe accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts, but we should be opening out accountability. If this body is involved in hospital projects then the Joint Committee on Health and Children should be able to examine it. It is important to protect public policy which is what we are elected to do on behalf of those who depend on public services. The Minister ought not to seek to limit this because these will be core decisions. If, for example, we decide to toll bypasses, it should not be presented as a technical issue over which the relevant committee has no jurisdiction. This is to pretend that something is good which is bad. It will be bad for people using bypasses, hospitals, prisons and so on.</P>
    <P>This Bill is poorly thought out and arises from the political motivation to do fancy footwork on funding because of the stability pact's pressures. The stability pact is foolish and Romano Prodi was correct to describe it as stupid. There should be financial controls on state spending but it is stupid that these prevent developing economies like ours from investing in infrastructure, which is sound. However, we need to find other ways of dealing with this because this way will not solve the crucial problems that have resulted in overruns and poor delivery of projects which affect people. This party will oppose this Bill on Second Stage and if it passes there, we will vigorously seek to amend it on order to protect the public interest and sound policy in the financing of public projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy M. Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill and the Minister's presentation today fills me with despair, partly brought on by the rain and the disastrous traffic chaos on Dublin's streets. In the future, this proposal will rank alongside the Minister's ill fated special savings scheme which was launched with great bravado and fanfare but doomed to be a millstone, as we all now recognise, around taxpayers' necks for years to come. There is little merit in the proposal to manufacture yet another agency on top of the National Treasury Management Agency, the NRA and the Railway Procurement Agency. The manner in which the Minister spirited himself away some time ago brings to mind <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.</i> He is not even here <Col N="1539" /> to listen to the debate which means that he has passed the first test of a good magician.</P>
    <P>We have 20 institutions managing the traffic chaos in the Dublin region and this Bill will add another layer of bureaucracy to any forthcoming national development plan projects relating to public transport, traffic or road building. I can envisage public meetings in the run up to the next general election in which commuter, school and hospital groups will be told with a great fanfare by their local Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats candidate that the project they are seeking has been referred to the national development finance agency which will take another couple of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Fianna Fáil script factory attempted to put about the impression in relation to the Estimates, and pathetically repeated again in today's press, that Fianna Fáil is a left of centre party. This is at a time when it is shredding the national development plan and essential services in health and education which affect the poor. The same script factory referred to the Labour Party as being in favour of taxation and spending on public services. I intend one day, if I can find a room high enough, to compile a chart of the agencies, quangos and consultants' reports which have resulted in the big, mind bogglingly inefficient structure that the two parties in Government have created and which has resulted in the gridlock which makes everyone in the Dublin region miserable today. They have condemned people to this kind of life with their big government notions resulting in quango piled upon quango and agency upon agency.</P>
    <P>As a result, no one in the public services is certain about who is responsible for anything because there is always some other agency that will deal with matters. This will be the mother and father of all the agencies even though, technically, it is primarily about a financial mechanism. All of us here know that its job could be done efficiently by the making some simple, straightforward changes to the powers of the National Treasury Management Agency. That legislation could be easily introduced but as a believer in governing by quango, agencies, boards and consultants, the Government will not agree to that.</P>
    <P>The functions proposed for the agency can be carried out by existing agencies. Why should we, as taxpayers, be lumbered with all the associated costs of a new agency simply because Fianna Fáil came up with the idea in the election to cover up its blatant failure to deliver on the projects in the national development plan. Underlining this general approach is the slavish transfer here of the British private finance initiative, and the Minister's attempt to cover himself on that in his speech is just one more bit of gobbledegook from our Harry Potter Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have been joined by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, whom my late colleague from Limerick used to refer to as &ldquo;Mighty <Col N="1540" /> Mouse&rdquo; because he blew very loud in Limerick but had nothing to say in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how politicians who pride themselves on their republican credentials are so slavish in their mindless allegiance to these imported dogmas and abandon so readily all critical judgment when they decide to ape their formal colonial masters come what may. Thankfully, the European Commission is putting some break on this crackpot idea of raising capital for public projects by the subterfuge of off balance sheet borrowings hidden under the guise of public private partnerships. No snake oil salesman in history has ever managed to sell a shoddy deal with the skills used to sell this package of damaged goods to the public and to the political establishment. As an accountant, I marvel at the suspension of critical faculties displayed by commentators, public servants and political leaders when they bought this idea.</P>
    <P>The record of excess borrowing and cost overruns in past public projects is a serious issue and some diversity of funding and importation of private sector disciplines and skills can offer the opportunity to secure much needed value for money, which sadly has been lacking from the Government for the past six years. I counsel caution, however, in the light of cross-channel experience and our own limited but very revealing experiences so far. There is a distinct danger of putting all our eggs in a very dodgy basket. Ireland is diving into PPPs at the time when wiser counsel across the channel is querying both the cost and effectiveness of private finance initiatives in delivering public capital projects.</P>
    <P>I cite in particular the expressed reservations of many accountancy professionals and I hope the Minister, as an accountant, acquaints himself with some of these reservations. One survey of more than 200 members of the Association of Chartered and Certified Accountants found that only 1% were in agreement that PFIs provided value for money and 57% were sure that new schools and hospitals were best provided through traditional routes. The comptroller and auditor general of the national audit office in the United Kingdom, the equivalent of our Comptroller and Auditor General, has publicly judged that value for money tests used in assessing private finance initiative schemes are no more than &ldquo;pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Accounting Standards Board has also noted that it is off balance sheet financing &ndash; off balance sheet financing was an accountant's device to allow people to borrow more while not declaring it. There are many examples of the end result of excessive off balance sheet financing, including Enron and WorldCom, and the same can happen with the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A BBC radio documentary last week reported that the national audit office in the United Kingdom will publish a scathing review of the <Col N="1541" /> cost effectiveness of this approach to school construction. The contractor referred to in that documentary was the same one our Department of Education and Science used in the five schools under construction under our PPP experiment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if any full evaluation has been carried out of the costs and benefits of this approach in the specific cases adopted thus far? In my constituency, the case of the Abbotstown swimming pool offers no evidence of spectacular success in transferring risk from the Exchequer and keeping costs under control. The opposite is the case. The costs for a swimming pool are now at the &euro;400 million mark. Who are we codding in this country? I am deeply sceptical of the whole idea. I have real concerns about long-term cost commitments and the absence of real competition in the use of the dubious preferred bidder system and I have major concerns about the additional bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>We know there is a fight going on in Cabinet between the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, about what happened to the extra billions for the health services. The Minster should spend a day examining what the Government did in the so-called reform of the Eastern Health Board in the greater Dublin area, where we had one board and one quango. It is an amoebic-like development. We now have four major boards, and they are growing. Extra boards and bodies are being set up almost on a weekly basis, all of them with chief executives, intense management and bureaucracy. That is where the money is going. It is not going to our nurses and doctors, the building of our hospitals, the provision of services such as radiology and so on. That is the disaster this incompetent Government, which has been six years in office, is visiting on us.</P>
    <P>One repeated justification for the PPP approach to public finance is the transfer of risk to the private promoters. This is pure fantasy. If a road, railway or hospital is to be built using this device, how can the State allow it to fail? There may be no explicit State guarantee, but it is not like the usual private sector commercial or business venture that depends on private sales and purchases for success, where there is a clear risk involved. If the goods do not sell or the venture does not work, the venture can be closed down but the road or railway builder or the school contractor are not selling their wares in a free market. They are selling them through the State which has to have that road, railway or school in place in a reasonable timeframe to meet public needs and the demands of economic progress. Ministers cannot prove there is a transfer of financial risk.</P>
    <P>As in <i>Animal Farm</i> it is a case of chanting, and I fear that is what is happening in the Department of Finance. The chant is, &ldquo;Private sector good, public sector bad,&rdquo; every hour on the hour and six times before breakfast, at all times and in all circumstances. It is the only way that the Minister <Col N="1542" /> can sell this package because no one would buy it otherwise.</P>
    <P>I want to see an accelerated programme of capital works. The delays thus far in the national programme are destructive in the extreme. My party welcomes a distinctive involvement of the private sector in new and creative ways if these are properly assessed and subject to cost and windfall profit control.</P>
    <P>Had the Labour Party been returned to Government we would have sought to augment the functions of the National Treasury Management Agency. For at least two years we have been arguing that delivery of the national development plan will require Exchequer borrowing. To obtain the best possible value for money in this regard we envisaged assigning the NTMA the task of advising on how money should be raised for each individual project. Frankly that is nothing more than common sense. Had it required legislative changes we would have been happy to do so. We would not have done what the Minister is doing. We would not have tried to pretend that, because it is called something else, Government borrowing can be anything other than Government borrowing. We would not have been so ideologically committed to PPPs as the means of delivering on the national development plan while cutting Exchequer capital spending.</P>
    <P>It is rather revealing how slow the private sector has been to date in taking up the PPP opportunities. Is it waiting in the wings until the State is over the barrel and it comes to the point where it would be offered the best terms possible to get stalled projects up and running? It is the failure of the promise to deliver on PPPs which motivates this Bill. For that reason we must be concerned that the new agency will see its role as breaking that log jam. I wonder if other forms of funding will really be considered. The Bill states that Departments will be forced to refer big projects to the agency and I wonder if that provision will be enforceable or if it is merely another time-wasting device.</P>
    <P>The accumulation of so much off-balance sheet debt is worrying. If there is no effective transfer of financial risk, PPPs will result in a build-up of a large stock of potential liabilities for the State. The European Commission is putting some breaks on some of these crackpot ideas. The proposals in the Bill are resting on the expectation that EUROSTAT will qualify all these as being off-balance sheet. The officials in EUROSTAT and those in the financial markets will read the report of this debate and I believe they will react accordingly.</P>
    <P>In relation to some of the details of the Bill I speak with some professional experience of management and accountancy. The board of this agency is to consist of a chairperson plus four members. This will be a re-run of the unfortunate National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission with private sector people from the investment and bond markets and a managing director of a recently unsuccessful private sector company <Col N="1543" /> which had formerly been successful. It is a totally conservative set-up. With the agreement of the board and by diktat, &euro;1billion a year will be invested in projects and equity markets from Hong Kong to New York. They are so ideologically driven that they have not given any thought to investing in Irish projects. There is no indication in the Bill that the agency will be able to establish rates of return which will allow the national pension reserve fund to invest in our infrastructure. The board is small in number and, like the pensions board, it will be confined to a particular type of individual from the private sector. I can tell the Minister of State for free rather than at &euro;2,500 a day what the board's advice will be and any accountant or economist could do the same for free.</P>
    <P>The accountability provisions in the Bill are a disgrace and are designed to occlude. The basic reporting requirement is the production of one annual report six months in arrears. In terms of good management and of any serious examination of the work of the agency, that is equivalent to accounting archaeology. It will mean trying to find out more than a year and a half after the event was committed by the agency and that is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A series of sections in the Bill are designed to provide an ethical framework for the members of the board but tied up in the ethical framework is a desire for secrecy. It would be easier for the board members to sign the Official Secrets Act. If a scheme turns out to be dreadful after it has been approved, there is no way of answering questions about it for up to two years afterwards when it eventually gets to the PAC. It is a shame and a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about this Bill. The Bill is quite shoddy in structure and most questionable in a number of areas. It is completely deficient in relation to public accountability. I have only a short amount of speaking time so I will pose some questions which I hope the Minister will answer in his reply. The Minister speaks about getting value for money but there is not the slightest concession towards social accounting in this legislation. I attended a presentation in Galway by the PPP section of the Department of Finance and it was interesting to listen to the response of the builders who were present. I see no evidence of any element of social accounting in relation to hospitals, schools or anything which will ultimately be consumed as a public service. The public are written out of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is badly drafted in a number of ways and the Minister exposes this in his rather extraordinary speech. He mentions the structure of the taking of advice. He suggests that the Minister for Finance will have a guiding role and, therefore, authority can be delegated to the Accounting Officer. I believe that this is in flagrant violation of the Ministers and Secretaries Act. The line <Col N="1544" /> Minister in any one of the areas will not have the responsibility in the Dáil and will not have the capacity to implement policy decided by this House or put before the electorate by way of mandate. This is quite extraordinary but it does not surprise me.</P>
    <P>Deputies Burton and Richard Bruton have referred to another issue in relation to projects. Deputy Burton questioned the position in relation to the ongoing guarantees that are required for a project that is delivered for public use. The extraordinary mechanism for establishing a company which will avoid a State guarantee creates the capacity for something to be brought into being for the use and benefit of the public where there is no guarantee for its continuance. There is not the slightest intention of seeking any social justification for a project and a project with a social impact has no guarantee of its continued existence.</P>
    <P>All this is on the basis of enabling investment to take place from private sources for which the profit is guaranteed, the capital acquisition and value over a period of time is doubly guaranteed and there is no risk taken whatsoever. This should not surprise anybody in this House. Looking at the capital formation in the State for several years and the requirements of those parts of the national development plan that have a social impact, one notes the manner in which the resources of this State have gone into speculative activity. It is for another day to look at the consequences this has had in relation to housing, land prices and so on.</P>
    <P>The accountability provisions of this Bill are seriously deficient and they are exactly the ones that have come in for criticism in Britain. The economics are highly questionable. I cannot understand for the life of me why the penny has not dropped yet about the idea of borrowing at a higher rate than the yield one is getting from public funds that are invested in future pension provision. Our failure to fund urgently needed public expenditure is an absolute disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Minister fails to justify many of the statements he made in his speech. Regarding the provision of advice, he claims that &ldquo;PPP projects are complex, requiring expert technical, legal and financial advice.&rdquo; What is the nature of the financial complexity? What is our experience in relation to what is being provided in this area? He goes on: &ldquo;A centrally resourced expert advisory service to all State authorities would be more economic than employing experts in each of these areas in every procuring authority, including the local authorities.&rdquo; Where is the evidence for that? It is a gratuitous insult to Members of the public service.</P>
    <P>I believe in something much more simple but more democratic &ndash; that political parties go to the public with their proposals, they get a mandate from the public and they form a Government. Ministers are appointed who take responsibility for the delivery of a programme and they are accountable in this House and to the public. This <Col N="1545" /> Bill flies in the totally opposite direction in relation to what is necessary for the public.</P>
    <P>Then there are the guidelines whereby projects would be evaluated when they have come back for final decision by the Department of Finance. The Minister has the neck to stand up in this House and suggest that he will consult other Ministers before the guidelines are issued, but why are the guidelines not here today? Is it because the Minister for Finance does not have the courage to stand up and say that there will be no social consideration of projects whatsoever? The Minister asserts that the NDFA will help to maximise value for money by identifying the best financing packages, but on what criteria? This whole notion is mystifying. The NDFA, financing itself, will be financed by a Government guarantee that is fairly conventional, but this does not run on in relation to any guarantee to the public for anything for which they might be dependent.</P>
    <P>Then there is the notion that this is a way of delivering plans without coming under the guidelines of the stability pact. Why does the Minister not have the courage to suggest that we deliberate openly in this House on how we will provide the investment needed to deliver aspects of the national development plan? It would have been much more honest to re-prioritise and change the national development plan, giving priority to those parts of it which can be best developed.</P>
    <P>There is a rather arrogant assertion at the very beginning of the Minister's speech. He tells us that &ldquo;The Bill before the House is an integral element in the Government's determination to ensure that all available sources of funding are utilised for infrastructural projects, including private finance&rdquo;. The Minister for Finance will become the Minister of the six budgets in a few weeks' time &ndash; he has suggested combining them all into a large volume which we will be able to read. When the history of this period is written, it will be concluded that he has had the effect of driving available capital into the most speculative usages.</P>
    <P>Consider the housing infrastructure in this country. People will not need to invest in vital, socially beneficial projects because they can get a much higher yield from speculative projects. On the other hand, he has insisted on all sorts of transfers of a regressive kind. Much more importantly, he will not discuss in this House the assumptions upon which this new proposal is being made. It is so obvious that everybody is asking him the question, why was the National Treasury Management Agency not used if this is what he wanted? Why bring another quango into existence?</P>
    <P>When Members of this House ask about different projects in our constituencies we are told, for example, that &ldquo;this is a matter for the NRA&rdquo;. One can imagine the situation now, when yet another quango is in existence and making decisions on vital infrastructure that is needed not only for economic benefit but for social benefit and for citizenship. The Bill is based upon bad <Col N="1546" /> economics, it is anti-public service and anti-public welfare, it is about conferring profit without risk to people who have a bad record, it is dubious in the assertions it makes about financial competence and it is the most disgraceful insult to the democratic process. It removes accountability from this House and from Ministers and it suggests that the Minister for Finance will dream up guidelines after we have enacted this legislation, while in the meantime we are asked to pass it on Second Stage. It should be opposed and should be voted down on Second Stage because it is so flawed it is not capable of amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a valuable contribution to the expeditious and cost-efficient completion of priority infrastructure projects, particularly in areas of economic disadvantage. This will lead to fundamental and lasting change for communities across the length and breadth of our country. Among the proposed functions of the new National Development Finance Agency is the raising of finance for NDP projects, including the financing of public private partnerships where this would be more cost effective than private funding.</P>
      <P>Enabling the private sector to invest directly in infrastructural projects will considerably reduce the drain on the public purse. As the private sector operates on a commercial basis, efficiency will also improve, or so the story goes. PPPs have virtually no track record and given that concession periods are usually at 15 to 20 years, there is to date virtually no PPP project that has completed all stages of the cycle according to original plans. On a cautionary note, several PPPs in the UK have already run into problems due to cost overruns, unrealistic price and income projections and legal disputes between private operators and the State.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, no free lunch. The notion that PPP is a way of creating public infrastructure at little or no cost to the public purse is of course nothing more than wishful thinking. Nobody does anything for nothing, least of all the private sector, which clearly will only invest in a project if it is reasonably certain that it can recoup its investment as well as make adequate profit. When the investment is recouped through road tolls, sales or other tariffs, it is users, taxpayers and-or the State who ultimately pay the cost of the project. The provision of advice to State authorities, including Departments, to assist them in the evaluation of financial risks and costs will also be a function of the new agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Project risks include all factors or eventualities which cannot be definitively predicted or incorporated into project costings. The larger and more complex the project the greater the risks. In large-scale infrastructure projects, typical risks include unforeseen engineering problems, cost and time overruns, currency exchange variations, unreliable market and demand projections and environmental and social costs. Unless Govern<Col N="1547" /> ment agencies such as the new national development finance agency will assume a significant portion of project risks, the willingness of the private sector to participate will be in doubt.</P>
    <P>Where public infrastructure is paid for by the State, the cost is distributed throughout society through various taxes based on income and profit while the benefits are distributed more evenly. The involvement of the private sector in public infrastructure leads to a form of flat taxation where only those who can afford to pay have access to the facility or service. This can result in reduced access to essential public facilities by those with the lowest capacity to pay, contributing to increased social inequality.</P>
    <P>In the case of toll roads, there are instances where high toll charges have excluded low income users resulting in a public road system available only to the wealthy. In the case of foreign companies, allowing them to invest in or have control over major public infrastructure projects has serious implications in terms of national sovereignty and independence and it raises fundamental questions about the role of the State as exercised through the national development finance agency.</P>
    <P>The ultimate question is who really benefits from PPPs? Will the NDFA determine what infrastructure is needed or who should shoulder the costs and risks involved in infrastructural development? Infrastructural projects usually respond to the needs of industry, the private sector and general economic growth and are justified on the theoretical promise that everyone will eventually benefit from economic growth and industrialisation.</P>
    <P>I note the report states that it is expected that the benefits of the NDFA will include maximising value for money by identifying the best financial packages, applying commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risks and costs for each project and centralising commercial expertise thereby reducing dependence on external consultants with the consequence cost savings. I welcome this if it occurs. I also note that section 5 will provide powers to enable the establishment of special purpose companies to give the NDFA additional options in raising moneys on the most beneficial terms for relevant projects. The section provides that the NDFA may form or cause to be formed an SPC. SPCs will be established for financing purposes only and they will not have a Government guarantee. The possible use of SPCs offers the benefit that the optimal financing structure can be put in place to raise money to invest in a project such as a bridge or tunnel with hard tolls where private sector financing packages are not sufficiently attractive.</P>
    <P>In the words of the ancient Chinese saying, &ldquo;Those who have suffered are not the beneficiaries, while those who have benefited are not the sufferers&rdquo;. I trust that the NDFA will ensure that this will not be the case.</P>

      <P>Given this period of cutbacks and retrenchment, it is ironic that the Minister for Finance is suggesting the formation of another State agency. That act seems to run counter to everything for which he has claimed to stand in the past &ndash; the needless expense of another such agency, the added bureaucracy it involves and the fact that it will be another layer with which the political system and the citizen must deal. The Minister would probably argue that this new agency has been the centrepiece of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and must be delivered on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the other argument. The Government has been selective in how it has chosen to implement its election manifesto and its now tattered programme for Government. This agency is being promoted because it is nothing less than a wheeze, it is a deception. It might be a deception founded on self-delusion caused by a Minister who has had the biggest budgetary surpluses for the longest period in the history of the State. It is self-deception on the part of the Minister for not recognising that large-scale borrowing must happen and that he is the person responsible for bringing this about. This Bill must be challenged because the Minister seemingly wants to act in contravention of international agreements we have entered into in terms of our debt-GDP ratio in relation to the Maastricht treaty. At the heart of this Bill is political deception.</P>
      <P>The agency seems to be structured in such a way as to deny and avoid the essence of political accountability, for which all of us in this House have been elected to ensure. This agency will be given powers that will allow it to decide how information on its activities will be divulged. One of the provisions of the Bill is in relation to the prohibition on the giving of information. The definition of &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; is whatever the board or Minister decides. Have we come to such a stage after the passage of progressive freedom of information legislation that we are putting into legislation caveats that allow members of the Government and appointees of Ministers to decide what is and what is not in the public interest? The clause to which I refer denies our right as public representatives to ask the appropriate questions.</P>
      <P>The fact that this is an agency that has been given a guarantee in terms of its borrowing of &euro;5 billion is something about which we have great concern. The fact that it is being promoted by a Government that has let public finances run riot gives us no confidence that this is a guarantee that will be honoured; it will more likely be used at its highest point at every possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the real focus of this agency &ndash; the protection and promotion of public private partnerships &ndash; it has been highlighted in the Chamber how ineffective this practice has been in the United Kingdom where such partnerships <Col N="1549" /> come under the title of &ldquo;public finance initiatives&rdquo;. Such a policy has been adopted with gusto there in terms not only of infrastructural development, but increasingly in terms of the provision of schools and hospitals, and such developments have been seen to fail in practically every respect. Public private partnerships allow the Government to be provided with infrastructure but to pay the costs of its provision over a longer period at a greater cost to the taxpayer. Are we serving the interests of the taxpayer if all we are doing is creating a new sense of the &ldquo;never never&rdquo; in terms of the public accounts? We have been through that in the 1970s and 1980s and we do not need to return to it.</P>
    <P>I can give Government Members who are present an example of how PPPs are working. At present, a contract exists to provide five new schools, one of which is in my constituency, Ballincollig community school. The contract will result in the demolition of the existing school structure and the provision of new school buildings which, under the concept, will be leased back classroom by classroom from a private company to the State.</P>
    <P>That school has a perfectly usable and acceptable gymnasium which is being used by community groups and sporting organisations in that community of 15,000 people. Its facilities are being provided by the local school, as they should be, for derisory and pepper-corn type rents. A public private partnership will knock down this gymnasium, build a new one and make it subject to market forces. Use of that facility by the community will be determined by that private company at an economic value to be determined by it. Will the Government explain how the community benefits from such a policy? We know that the taxpayer does not benefit.</P>
    <P>I share the reservations expressed by other speakers that this attempt at deception will be seen through by authorities in the European Union and the European Central Bank. The attempt to pretend we are not borrowing will be seen for what it is. Ultimately, we need a new discipline, other than that about which the Minister for Finance seems to be talking, to avoid borrowing on the scale proposed. The question we should be asking in relation to the national development plan is, why has this happened in this way given the small amount provided at such great cost? Why have there been cost overruns? Who has benefited from cost overruns? Why are we even thinking of putting in place a new system and agency when we have fundamental problems with how infrastructure is provided? It is another exercise in avoidance by the Government.</P>
    <P>On these grounds as well as the lack of necessity for such an agency, the secretive nature which such an agency will adopt, the size of the guarantee, the fact that special companies will be established by this agency which will result in even less accountability and the experience we have had of PPPs to date, this agency should not come into existence and this Bill should not be <Col N="1550" /> enacted. It is my party's intention to oppose what is proposed by the Government at every interval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus of this Bill is the need to fund the development of infrastructure in this State. It immediately raises the question, what have we to show for the prosperity of the Celtic tiger years? That is a question our children and future generations will ask. They will ask why, when the State had unprecedented wealth at its disposal, it fell so far short of providing the long neglected infrastructure that would provide the foundation for future economic development and social progress.</P>
      <P>Despite the succession of budget surpluses and the exceptional flow of wealth through the economy over the past decade, our basic infrastructure is still deficient. The most obvious examples are roads, public transport and telecommunications but health care provision and acute hospital services are also an integral and important part of that basic infrastructure. There has been a failure to deliver on these, as promised under the national development plan. The Book of Estimates published last week confirms that failure and, I fear, will lead to even further delays. It is farcical that years after the publication of the national development plan, we still do not have a national spatial strategy, although it is promised shortly.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, this is probably one of the greatest ever examples of putting the cart before the horse. Development on this island is notoriously unbalanced with huge disparities between regions and, indeed, within regions. Neglected areas of the Border, midlands and west stand in stark contrast to the congested gridlock and overdeveloped regions of the east and south. This is the result of decades of bad planning or, worse, no planning at all.</P>
      <P>For the people in neglected regions and for those socially and economically marginalised areas within &ndash; I emphasise &ndash; all regions, including parts of this city, throughout the east and in the southern region, this means, in effect, a lower standard of living and a poorer quality of life for them. Simply put, we do not have a level playing pitch and that must be recognised.</P>
      <P>There is not a Deputy representing a constituency who cannot point to that reality within his or her own compass. In my constituency, we are bottom of the list on the National Roads Authority development programme. The Estimates cuts will push us down even further. As a direct result, the towns of Monaghan, Castleblayney and Carrickmacross will continue to suffer the negative economic effects of traffic congestion. The same will apply in the towns of Virginia, Cavan and Belturbet in County Cavan. As I said, I know this is reflected in the experience not only of my party colleagues in other constituencies but, I warrant, in the experience of all Deputies here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike some other parts of the island, we have virtually no public transport and we are bottom <Col N="1551" /> of the list in terms of telecommunications infrastructure development. It is clear that successive Governments, including this one, have not regarded public transport as an integral and vital part of our infrastructure. Public transport needs to be seen in exactly the same way as our roads network. It must be fully funded because it is absolutely essential for the economy to function.</P>
    <P>We, in Sinn Féin, published our pre-budget submission this morning. We detailed our view of the vital infrastructure required for the provision of public transport. Public transport should no longer be treated as an add-on to Government transport policy. Only when we have a greatly improved public transport network will motorists be able to abandon their cars and take to bus and rail in significant enough numbers to reduce road accident deaths and reduce damage to the environment through pollution. Commuting times would also be reduced with a follow-on benefit to business and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>In this regard, this morning we saw the evidence of the growing frustration and anger not only of the citizenry of this city but of many other major population centres throughout the jurisdiction where congestion on roads and gridlock is contributing not only to ill health, but to a poor economic reality for many people. The effect is right across the board and is something with which we must be prepared to grapple. Public transport is the key in a real and certain way.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to any attempt to privatise public transport or our road network, either openly or by stealth through the use of so-called public private partnership. Efforts should be made to explore other methods of funding which ensure that the construction and maintenance of our infrastructure remains in public hands. I am concerned at the apparent over-reliance in this Bill on public private partnerships. Public transport must be funded to at least the level of our counterparts in Europe. Without proper funding, an efficient public transport system simply will not emerge. Privatisation or liberalisation, as it is sometimes described, of CIE is neither required nor desired, rather sustained and credible financial support for public transport must be the priority. We are opposed to the use of PPPs for road building. While we see planned development and proper maintenance of our road network as essential, especially outside Dublin, funding, if necessary, should be secured through borrowing rather than using the discredited PPP system. Borrowing has become a bad word, but the notion that borrowing is alien to good practice is far from the truth. There are much worse propositions entailed in the Government's current thinking and I urge a re-think.</P>
    <P>We need only look at the massive over pricing in the construction industry which is costing the State many millions over the odds in major construction budgets. I no not have to name them out as they are self-evident. For example, during the debate on the Ansbacher accounts we called <Col N="1552" /> for an investigation into the monopoly position of Cement Roadstone Holdings. There is a monopoly in the area of cement and the concrete industry. Anti-competitive practices have squeezed smaller operators out of that business, often by questionable methods. They are in a position to fleece the State because of the reliance on them for so many projects. Will the national development finance agency be empowered to examine this issue and advise the Government accordingly? I hope that it would, because I see it as an important and integral part of the agency's brief.</P>
    <P>We need to have the broadest possible definition of infrastructure, as set out in the national development plan. It is much more than roads, transport and telecommunications. The definition should also embrace social infrastructure, including &ndash; and I make no apology for naming it first &ndash; hospitals, schools and our greatly underdeveloped child care facilities. The Book of Estimates has imposed cuts in all these areas. I regard our stock of social housing as being part of infrastructure, yet it has been one of the most neglected sectors. The Government has relied totally on the market to address the housing needs of the people and it has failed miserably. Long-term investment is required to allow the State and local authorities to lead the way on housing. Some 54,000 household units are waiting for housing through our local authority systems. If we do not address it then we are storing up more social problems for the future.</P>
    <P>It was recently mooted that the Government is considering the disposal of a number of landbanks and properties that are in public ownership, in order to fund the new agency. It would be an important and positive decision if the Government could ring-fence the moneys realised from the disposal of such properties, specifically for the provision of social housing. If there is the political will, it is realisable that 70% of the waiting list figures could be addressed in a two year period. Social housing is an integral part of infrastructure and it must be a priority to address the scandal of our growing waiting lists that are increasing by the order of some 8,000 annually. On the current projected figures it would take up to 40 years to address all of those currently on the lists and expected to come on to them in the near future. We must grapple with this problem and the NDFA provides the means. Let us translate this reserve of funds that can be drawn from public properties and lands and invest it in housing for people that need it. That would be a good start.</P>
    <P>I look forward to teasing out the detail on the full implications of the Bill on Committee Stage. I have many concerns. Is this agency going to make a real difference or will it be another layer of bureaucracy, a barrier between Ministers and the public, and also a barrier between Members of this House and the Government which is responsible for delivering on the national development plan? It must not be that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" />I am also very concerned that this agency could be used as an engine for driving the privatisation of our infrastructure. It must not be that either. In other countries this has proved to be disastrous, with the State having to come back in at huge costs after the private sector has made its profits, extracted its returns and then failed to maintain the infrastructure and the services in less well-off times. We have to learn the lessons, not only of our own experience, but of other jurisdictions, and apply them in terms of planning in the best way for the future.</P>
    <P>I will reserve further comment for Committee Stage. I look forward to clarification of the many concerns and questions I have posed. I hope for a positive response to the proposals I have made, not least of all in regard to the ever-growing scandal of our housing waiting lists. An opportunity presents itself and I urge the Minister of State and his colleagues to grasp it.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish the national development finance agency. Its creation is a necessary element in the Government's determination to address the country's infrastructural deficit. It is vital to ensure the continued ability of our economy to grow and develop. The creation of this agency was one of the proposals in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>
      <P>The functions of the NDFA will include the provision of advice to State authorities to help them evaluate the financial risks and costs of public investment projects. It will be involved in the assessment of optimal financing for public projects and, in certain circumstances, it will raise finance for public investment projects and the creation of special purpose companies. The NDFA will be State guaranteed but the special purpose companies will not.</P>
      <P>The agency will help to maximise value for money for the Exchequer by identifying the best financial packages and applying commercial standards in terms of evaluating financial risks and costs for each project. The projects involved will include infrastructural projects and programmes of projects under the national development plan. Of particular importance will be the role the agency will play in the underpinning of public private partnerships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>PPPs are partnerships between the public sector and the private sector for the purpose of designing, planning, financing, constructing and-or operating projects which would be regarded traditionally as falling within the remit of the public sector. Infrastructural projects such as roads and bridges are prime examples. PPPs are the way forward. It is a common sense approach that should be supported by everyone, so as not to deprive the country of future development. PPPs <Col N="1554" /> offer accelerated delivery of priority economic infrastructure projects under the national development plan. They offer improved value for money for the State and the provision of quality public services. Currently, there are in excess of 40 PPP projects at different stages of procurement. They are a recognition that the public and private sectors have experience and skills in dealing with particular situations and they aim to tap into these and to allocate project risks to the party best able to manage them. In addition, outside the national development plan metro procurement is being explored as a public private partnership.</P>
    <P>The PPP process is supported by unions, employers and the construction industry. The aim is to maximise the contribution of PPPs consistent with the principles of efficiency and best value for money taking account of economic, social and environmental objectives. As part of the social partnership approach to systematic development of PPP the Minister for Finance launched the framework for public private partnership on 1 November 2001. This fulfils a requirement in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to develop a clear framework to assess the appropriateness of PPP for infrastructural projects and guide their implementation, taking into account the wider economic, social and environmental objectives that should guide infrastructural development, irrespective of the procurement method followed.</P>
    <P>Information seminars form part of the nation-wide PPP communications strategy and are held by the PPP unit in the Department of Finance together with representation of each of these key stake holders and they offer an opportunity for discussion and debate on issues relating to PPP. Following the national launch of the framework in Dublin, seminars were held in Cork, Waterford, Athlone and Galway. Public private partnership will form an increasing part of the tool kit of public sector procurement as familiarity with the concept grows and we make further progress. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

The Bill recognises the new realities of the delivery of major infrastructural projects, which are massive in scale, international in nature and highly sophisticated in terms of finance.</P>

      <P>The biggest problem facing those who travel to Dublin from the Louth-Meath direction is the lack of proper park and ride facilities because they cannot get into the city. Under this proposal, when projects are selected, it would make sense to pick a number of sites on the periphery of the city so that those who do not live near bus or train stations can avail of parking. A great deal of money has been invested in the national development plan to improve rail links. Bridges along the line to the North were recently raised but if this element of the NDP had been <Col N="1558" /> properly thought out, these bridges would have been raised sufficiently to increase train capacity by 40%. Government plans, including the NDP, have not been thought out properly and one of the roles of the proposed agency should be to research the long-term needs of the projects it selects, particularly in terms of rail transport.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, to provide a clearer legislative basis for the power of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to grant temporary release by setting down the principles which will apply to the exercise of this power.</P>
      <P>The power to grant temporary release is currently provided for in section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, which provides that the Minister may make rules for the temporary release of prisoners subject to conditions which may be imposed in each case. Rules made under this section include provisions for the imposition of conditions applicable to temporary release and for procedural matters.</P>
      <P>Section 2 is a general provision and does not contain any guidance for the exercise of this power. The desirability of setting out more clearly in legislation the criteria which should apply to the operation of the system of temporary release first became evident following the findings of the High Court in the Corish case, judgment in which was delivered early in 2000. The net point of the judgment in that case was that there was no power to refuse to consider temporary release for certain categories of offenders because the 1960 Act did not specify that such a power existed. This related to a situation where Ministers for Justice had over the years specified categories of prisoners who are not considered for temporary release, save in exceptional circumstances. These categories included sex offenders, drug offenders and others where a risk to the community was significant or where public revulsion at the nature of such offences was particularly strong. The operation of such broad exclusions ceased following the Corish judgment and since then each case has been considered on its individual merits, subject to the paramount concern for the safety of the public.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not proposing in this Bill to reinstate power to exclude categories of offenders from temporary release. He is not doing so because of the sweeping nature of such broad exclusionary powers, particularly in a situation where the expansion of prison places provided by the previous Government and continued by this Government facilitates the operation of temporary release in a controlled and structured way. Instead, the current practice of dealing with all cases on an individual basis will continue, including the need to assess risk to the public in the circumstances of each individual case.</P>
      <P>However, that is not to say that no action was required arising from the judgment in the Corish case. The case in fact was a convincing argument that the 1960 provision was short on specifics and certainly not up to the standards of transparency which we now rightly expect to apply to the exercise of ministerial powers. It was for that reason that the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sought and obtained Government approval for this Bill to more clearly set out the criteria which should govern the operation of the temporary release regime. Indeed, during the course of preparation of the Bill, the Supreme Court, in a non-binding comment in the case of the DPP <i>v.</i> Finn of 24 November 2000, suggested that it is desirable that the system of temporary release be placed on a clearer and more transparent basis. That is exactly the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before discussing the details of the Bill it is important to reflect on why temporary release <Col N="1561" /> exists and how it operates in this country. In that context it is important to understand that temporary release is in fact our system of parole which is an essential feature of prisons systems worldwide.</P>
    <P>Systems of parole or temporary release exist because it is generally recognised that more is expected of a modern prison system than locking up its offenders until the entire sentence is served, by which time the person may be released back into society unchanged or changed for the worse. The prison system must take a more proactive role in seeking to ensure, in so far as is possible, that those released from prison will not re-offend both in terms of the longer-term safety of the community and in the interests of rehabilitating the individual prisoner. The temporary release system can therefore assist the purposes of preventing the commission of crime and safeguarding the community. It also operates on a humanitarian level in seeking to help offenders to take the important step away from crime and into more positive and law-abiding lives.</P>
    <P>Temporary release may be granted for various reasons to prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment. Short-term releases may be granted for different periods of time ranging from a few hours to one or two days and for a variety of reasons, including compassionate reasons such as the illness or death of a near relative. Efforts are also made where possible to plan structured temporary releases for re-socialisation purposes and to plan for the reintegration of offenders into the community.</P>
    <P>Pre-release preparation can include transfer to a less secure institution, or an open prison or a programme of short-term releases which might progress from supervised to unsupervised outings. The purpose of such programmes would be to reduce the effects of institutionalisation, by aiding, for example, familiarisation with the outside world or maintaining relationships with family or relatives. Pre-release preparation can include temporary release to attend work experience or training. For example, prisoners in the training unit who are deemed suitable may attend the workshops run by PACE &ndash; Prisoners Aid through Community Effort. PACE is a voluntary organisation for the care and education of offenders founded in 1969. The organisation runs a training workshop at Santry where various skills can be acquired which increase the possibility of finding work. The Santry workshop is attended both by serving prisoners on day release programmes and by some who have recently finished their sentences. Prisoners may also be granted weekly renewable temporary release after careful screening to take up employment or to continue education or vocational training courses. Of course, pre-release preparation often includes temporary release to attend residential treatment for alcohol or drug addiction.</P>
    <P>Decisions on pre-release programmes are made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or senior officials of the Irish Prisons Service on his behalf. Review meetings are held <Col N="1562" /> regularly in each prison institution to facilitate the exchange of information and aid decision making in the management of offenders' sentences. Each meeting is chaired by the governor or deputy or assistant governor of the institution and attended by the governors, probation and welfare staff, chaplains, teachers, other prison staff and an official from Irish Prisons Service headquarters. Where an offender is engaging with other services in the prison such as the psychology, psychiatry or other medical services, the professional dealing with the specific offender will also be invited to attend when required.</P>
    <P>Issues concerning risk to the community and preparation for re-integration are much more complex in relation to offenders serving long sentences. For this reason last year the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform established an interim parole board to advise in relation to the administration of longer term prison sentences including the type of programmes which should be in place leading to release. The board replaced the Sentence Review Group which was set up in 1989 by the then Minister for Justice to review the cases of convicted persons who had served more than seven years of a determinate or indeterminate sentence. The interim parole board began its work in December 2001 having first received training from Irish Prisons Service, probation and welfare and psychiatric service sources. The board also received instruction from training personnel attached to the English parole board on their methods and sat in on hearings of the English parole board.</P>
    <P>The board reviews cases of prisoners sentenced to determinate sentences of eight years or more but less than 14 years when the prisoner has served half of the sentence. In the cases of prisoners sentenced to 14 years or more, including life sentences, the board will review after seven years have been served of the sentence. To be eligible for review, a prisoner must have at least 12 months left to serve of his or her sentence at the time of the review. I stress that in making its recommendations to the Minister, the board already has regard to the type of criteria provided for in this Bill. Enactment of this Bill will provide a statutory base for such criteria which the Minister will have to have regard to in dealing with recommendations from the board. The board has been set up on an administrative basis initially and based on the experience gained in the operation of the board on this basis, legislative proposals to put it on a statutory basis may be drawn up at a later date.</P>
    <P>It has been said before here, and I repeat it, that there is always an element of risk in the operation of any system of parole or temporary release. Careful examination must be given to often conflicting considerations such as rehabilitation of the offender and his or her re-integration into society, and any risk which a particular release might pose. The paramount concern must, of course, always be the safety of the public. Nevertheless any Minister for Justice, Equality <Col N="1563" /> and Law Reform must continually perform a difficult balancing act in operating a system of temporary release.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now very much aided in achieving the right balance due to the Government's commitment to the programme of building and modernisation of prisons which has resulted in the provision of 1,200 additional prison places so far and has resulted in the welcome closing of the revolving door. Therefore, without the pressure to relieve overcrowding in the prison system the Minister is able to operate a system of temporary release in a planned and controlled way. Nevertheless, the balancing of possible risks against possible benefits will always remain a feature of any temporary release scheme.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be easy to play safe and eliminate any possibility of temporary release so that the Minister could never be accused of putting any citizen at risk from a released prisoner. However, the Minister believes that such an approach would have serious consequences in establishing an inhumane regime which would ultimately create greater risks for the public from prisoners whose only prospects for the future upon release may be to continue with a life of crime. No Member would advocate such a dark ages approach. Instead the legislature has accepted through the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, that there is a need for a system of temporary release and this Bill seeks to make more transparent the criteria which should apply to the exercise of this power and the considerations which must be taken into account in deciding on individual applications for temporary release.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill. The Bill is a short one with only two sections, the first of which is a standard provision which contains the Short Title and commencement provision. The main provisions of the Bill are contained in section 2 which amends the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, by inserting a new section 2 into that Act. Subsection (i) of the new section 2 provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can direct the temporary release of a person serving a sentence of imprisonment. Subsection (ii) makes it clear that imprisonment includes detention in St. Patrick's Institution and in detention centres provided for in the Prisons Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) sets out the purposes for which temporary release may be granted by the Minister. These are to assess the person's ability to reintegrate into society upon such release; to prepare a person for release upon expiration of his or her sentence or upon his or her being discharged from prison; and to enable a person to assist the Garda Síochána in the prevention, detection or investigation of offences, or the apprehension of a person guilty of, or suspected of having committed, an offence. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) further provides that a person may be temporarily released where circumstances exist to justify <Col N="1564" /> the person's release on health grounds or on other humanitarian grounds.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that a person may be temporarily released where, in the opinion of the Minister, the release is necessary or expedient to ensure good government of the prison concerned or to maintain good order and the humane and just management of the prison concerned. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) provides that a person may be temporarily released if the Minister is satisfied that the person has been rehabilitated and would be capable of reintegrating into society.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) sets out the considerations which the Minister must take into account in deciding whether to grant temporary release. This subsection is intended to give a statutory basis to the considerations that have hitherto been taken into account in practice in reaching decisions on whether to grant temporary release and reflect internationally accepted practice. The considerations are the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates; the sentence concerned and any recommendations made by the court in relation to the sentence imposed; the period of the sentence served by the person; the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released; the person's previous criminal record; the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release; the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release; any report or recommendation made by the governor, the Garda Síochána, a probation and welfare officer or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release; the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release; the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release; and the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's re-integration into society or improve his or her prospects of obtaining employment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) sets out the circumstances in which the Minister shall not give a direction for the temporary release of a person. The three circumstances are where it would not be appropriate to give such a direction for persons connected with any one or more of the considerations listed in subsection (2). This simply means that the Minister must not grant temporary release where he or she considers he or she should not do so on the basis of any or all of the criteria in subsection (2). So if considering any of the criteria the Minister is of the view that the person should not be granted temporary release then he or she cannot grant such release even if another of the criteria might suggest that temporary release would be beneficial. For example, if the potential threat to the safety or security of the public is so great that he or she feels the prisoner should not be released, the fact the release might improve the persons prospects of employment need not be <Col N="1565" /> considered. Second, paragraph (<i>b</i>) provides that temporary release may not be granted if it is prohibited by existing or future statutory prohibitions on temporary release. Such statutory prohibitions exist with a saver for grave reasons of a humanitarian nature in section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990 in relation to persons convicted of treason or of certain murders and attempted murders, for example, the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána. Similarly, section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act as amended by section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999 provides that temporary release cannot be granted to a person where the mandatory minimum penalty of ten years imprisonment for drug trafficking has been imposed under that section, except for grave reasons of a humanitarian nature. Third, paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that temporary release may not be granted to prisoners serving sentence for one or more offences who are on remand for another offence or offences.</P>
    <P>Subsections (4) and (5) provide for the governor to be informed and to give effect to the Minister's decision. Subsection (6) provides clarification that the granting of a period of temporary release does not create an entitlement to further periods of temporary release. Each and every release is a separate matter, having regard on each occasion to the criteria set down in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) provides that the Minister may make rules for the purpose of enabling this section to have full effect and that such rules may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as the Minister considers necessary or expedient. Subsection (8) provides that any rules made must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Subsection (9) provides that nothing in the Bill shall affect the operation of the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998. This subsection is precautionary to ensure that the arrangements applying to temporary release of qualifying prisoners under the terms of the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998 cannot be adversely affected by anything in this Act.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to an amendment which the Minister is considering proposing to the Bill on Committee Stage. The amendment would give effect to the provisions in Chapter 5 of the Schengen Convention relating to the transfer of the enforcement of criminal judgments and to the 1997 Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe's 1983 Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This would have the effect of amending the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995 and deal with situations where a sentenced person has left the territory of the sentencing state. The new provisions will allow for the sentence to be carried out in the state to which the offender has absconded and in which he or she is considered to be a national. The consent of the sentenced person would not be required for these new provisions. As this amendment would extend the scope of the Bill it would also be necessary to bring forward an amendment changing the Long <Col N="1566" /> and Short Title of the Bill. It would be the Minister's intention to bring forward the appropriate amendments on Committee Stage to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in keeping with a view expressed by the Supreme Court in a case in 2000 &ndash; Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Finn &ndash; that a clearer and more transparent basis for the system of temporary release is desirable. In the course of its judgment the Supreme Court went on to say that it is extremely desirable that remission and sentence review should be placed on a clear and transparent basis but that it is ultimately a matter for the Oireachtas to decide whether to retain the present system, put it on a clearer and more transparent basis, devolve it to a parole board or confer it on the courts. This Bill, together with the establishment of the parole board which will advise the Minister in relation to the sentence management of long-term prisoners pending the enactment of legislation to create a statutory parole board, will provide the clear and transparent basis which the Supreme Court has said is desirable, as well as the necessary safeguards required, for the operation of the system of temporary release.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the House did not receive longer notice of this interesting legislation. Perhaps in future the Minister may inform the House sooner when legislation such as this is presented.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has stated several reasons for the introduction of this Bill but he did not give the one which counts. I do not discount the reasons given by the Minister of State but he left out the most important one. By chance, I discovered this reason when I came across an article.</P>
      <P>The first reason given by the Minister of State is that the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, made it clear that it was the Supreme Court's view that a clearer and more transparent basis for temporary release was desirable. Is this the reason this Bill has been introduced? The Supreme Court makes many judgments.</P>
      <P>The second reason given by the Minster of State is that the High Court decided in January 2000 that the Minister had exceeded his powers in deciding not to authorise temporary release for certain categories of prisoners, such as those convicted of drug dealing. The High Court decided that, under section 2(1) of the 1960 Act, the Minister could not be permitted to categorise prisoners for temporary release. I am still unconvinced that these are the reasons for the introduction of this legislation. I believe these are peripheral reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill make good sense. The Bill sets out the purposes for which temporary release may be granted by the Minister. Temporary release prepares prisoners for release and enables them to assist in investigation, apprehension or prosecution of an offender. It allows the <Col N="1567" /> Minister to release prisoners on health or humanitarian grounds or ensure good order and management of prisoners. I will return to this latter point later.</P>
    <P>The new section 2(2) sets out the considerations the Minister must take into account in deciding whether to grant temporary release, including the nature and gravity of the offence, the sentence and the period served, the safety and security of the community, the criminal record, the conduct of the prisoner, the risk of re-offending as well as the risk of failing to meet the conditions of temporary release or failing to return to prison. Reports from prison officers and the Garda must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with these things, but one must note the real reason behind the ministerial considerations, which was spelled out by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in 1994 in an article in <i>The Irish Times.</i> He pointed out the legislation governing temporary release was totally silent on the criteria for temporary release and the question of immunity from civil liability actions against the Minister for Justice. He expressed concern that strong grounds for civil liability actions could arise where members of the public were victims of crimes committed by prisoners on release.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell went on to say that the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, gave the Minister power to suspend the currency of sentences and grant periods of release and that if it could be shown that prisoners had been released simply because of a shortage of prison accommodation and that there was a reasonable probability that they would re-offend, the Minister would certainly have an uphill battle in the courts. The silence of the legislation acts as an insurance policy for the Minister and his Department because when somebody who is temporarily released re-offends, compensation claims are made against the State. The insurance policy saves the Minister from such claims and the consequences of temporary release.</P>
    <P>Since those statements were made in 1994, we have seen the prison population more than double to about 3,400 or 3,500 prisoners. The situation improved a little since 1994, but we are now losing control again. People are afraid that those being put on temporary release who are committing crimes in great numbers will lead to civil action against the Minister. That is why we are here.</P>
    <P>One has to be honest about this issue, deal with it and let the House know why we are here. What I have alluded to is an indictment of the present situation and an admission that it is getting out of control.</P>
    <P>It is a week since we learned that we will not get the 2,000 gardaí that were promised in An Agreed Programme for Government. That is not just disappointing, it is not right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" />I have been spokesman for only five or six months and my party colleagues might not like me saying that I might not be the most suitable one because I tend to agree with much of what the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has done since he came to office. He has had good, innovative ideas and is good at public relations, which is important, but last week he failed absolutely because he lost the battle for the gardaí. He lost the battle internally at the Cabinet table for the resources and manpower, and that can change things on the streets. It is not easy for me to say he has failed, but I believe it.</P>
    <P>There were some articles in the paper about the spats going on between the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the extra funding for the Garda. It was intimated that the battle had been waged by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but it seems that is not the case.</P>
    <P>With regard to temporary releases, we should turn to the example of juveniles in Dublin, whom I believe are in a state of perpetual release. When they come before the courts, they are not sentenced by judges in many cases because the spaces for them do not exist and have not for many years. This must change because it is an indictment of the present system.</P>
    <P>Some things have improved. As the Minister of State spelled out, the Parole Board is an advantage. People sentenced to between eight and 14 years are eligible for review when half their sentences have been served. People who are sentenced to between 14 years and life are eligible for review after seven or eight years. The Parole Board can make three core recommendations regarding short-term releases, leading to full temporary release, transfers to other prisons, therapy education and work training programmes. I am not against these, but I hope the Minister does not have to accept these recommendations when put in front of him and that he takes a very stringent view of them.</P>
    <P>I am not against temporary release in general. One cannot be against it completely, but I would like to see it near the end of people's sentences. Sometimes I feel we care more about the criminal in this country that we do about the victim. A life sentence in this country is not a life sentence, but means that one will get seven years or more. Any petty crook sentenced to a year understands that he will not be in jail for a year. In most circumstances, he will probably serve six or seven months and then be released. Sentences that are handed out by judges are not realistic, even to this day. They do not correspond with reality and that has weakened the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>On any given day there are probably 200 or 300 temporary releases. One provision that is not in this Bill, but which I would like to see and which victim support groups have asked for is that a victim should be notified as a common courtesy if he wishes so that he will know if somebody is out on temporary release. There was a case a couple of years ago where a young woman who had been <Col N="1569" /> raped was walking in a park with her mother, and who walked towards her only the person who had raped her? This must be addressed by way on an amendment on Committee Stage. It would not be a gesture but would be important for those people who have suffered greatly. If the perpetrators of crimes are granted temporary release, their victims should be notified.</P>
    <P>The real reason we are here is that circumstances have worsened and the Government is afraid that claims will be taken against the State and the Minister. That should have been admitted and that is why this Bill is before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Since becoming my party's spokesperson on justice I have yet to see the Minister in the House. The Minister of State lives in Limerick and has much further to travel than the Minister, who lives in Dublin 4. While I appreciate the traffic problems in the south of the city, the Minister should find time to attend the House to present legislation in his name. It is not good enough for him not to be present and to delegate this Bill to the Minister of State. The Minister is responsible for it and he is not treating the House with the respect it deserves. I hope the Minister of State will pass this message to him. We would like to see him here on occasion. He spoke on the debate on the Book of Estimates, which is not his remit, declaring that he was not a communist. We knew that, but it would be much better if he was here to explain why he has introduced this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy correctly said the reasons for the legislation are not those which the Minister of State outlined. The Minister is afraid there will be civil and perhaps criminal actions taken against him and the Government because of the lack of a proper legislative basis for the release of prisoners. Prisoner releases have taken place on a revolving door basis in the absence of adequate criteria to create space in prisons. Temporary releases, made for no valid reason, often became permanent releases. The Minister of State did not mention this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is likely that because of the large scale of prisoner releases at that time, this will be the only legislation from this Department to be passed before Christmas. It is right and proper, on a humanitarian basis, that there should be releases then but previous legislation did not provide a basis for it. Without the underpinning of this legislation the Minister and the State may be liable. This why we are dealing with narrowly defined legislation that introduces no new concepts and that merely establishes criteria on the grounds on which the Minister might release prisoners. The Minister should have been clear about this and perhaps in his reply the Minister of State will acknowledge this is the real reason for the legislation. An enormous opportunity has been missed to introduce comprehensive legislation to deal with the temporary release of prisoners in the context of good prison management, reintegration and rehabilitation. However, this aspect <Col N="1570" /> is not built into prisoner sentences and the preparation of prisoners for release back into society.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates makes clear that the Minister has lost the argument on the need for resources. Perhaps the reason he was so vocal in the debate on the Estimates last night was that he was annoyed that he will not be able to provide any of the 2,000 extra gardaí he promised. Worse, he is proposing to close Shanganagh Castle, the only open prison centre for juveniles between the ages of 16 and 21 years. He and his predecessor have run down the facilities at the centre. It has a capacity for 60 inmates, yet at present only 16 are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Of all the facilities used for the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners, Shanganagh Castle is the most important for juveniles. It is outrageous that a full quota of staff is servicing a facility that is only at one-third of capacity. It is clear that the Minister intends to close this, the only juvenile open institution in the country. There are adult open institutions, such as Shelton Abbey, Loughan House and, to a lesser degree, Castlerea Prison. However, because the Minister did not get his way in the allocation to his Department in the Book of Estimates he will sell Shanganagh Castle, including the surrounding 25 acres of prime development land. I understand local residents are satisfied with the location of the centre.</P>
    <P>The closure of Shanganagh Castle will be a retrograde step in the treatment of juvenile offenders. It means they will be confined to St. Patrick's Institution, a dour place, with no hope of being prepared for release into society despite the overwhelming evidence that once young offenders become adults the chances of successfully rehabilitating them are remote. At the same time the Minister is building an institution as an adjunct to St. Patrick's Institution for those aged between 12 and 14 years at a cost of &euro;9 million. It will hold six offenders. It would not cost the State to house them at Shanganagh Castle.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessor have refused access by Amnesty International to the prisons at a time when the Government is happy to quote its reports in the international arena. Only Turkey and Egypt have acted similarly along with countries headed by dictatorships. How can we stand by a system if we are not going to allow the most respected international human rights organisation access to the prisons? What has the Minister to hide? He should have been delighted to have been given the opportunity to allow Amnesty International to see what is being done in the prisons because much good work is being done. It is a disgrace to us as citizens that we are the only country in Europe that has acted in this way. I hope the Minister of State will tell the Minister that we do not take kindly to his refusal to honour our international obligations in this matter.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give statutory underpinning to the criteria and the grounds on which people can be released in the future. It is <Col N="1571" /> regrettable that the Bill does not deal with other issues. For example, no consideration has been given to the report published by the National and Economic Social Forum, of which I was a member under the previous Administration, which considered the question of temporary release and the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners. That document was produced earlier this year and the Government accepted its recommendations and indicated that they would be implemented. It showed that at that time &euro;1,000 per week was spent on each prisoner, a colossal amount to spend just on locking them up, and that at 70% we have one of the worst recidivist rates in Europe. At the same time there was an enormous prison building programme and the Garda Síochána announced that crime figures were diminishing yearly, but such statistics do not tell the whole story because other surveys revealed that many people do not report crime. We have a serious situation in which the prison population has virtually doubled in the last decade but the increase in prison places was not in tandem with a thought out approach, which is what this report contains.</P>
    <P>It recommends that we put on a statutory basis a programme to deal with prisoners from the moment they are inducted into prison until they are released. Such an holistic approach is the only way to proceed. In this model the prisoner, as soon as he enters prison, would be seen and consulted by an intra-agency panel which would establish a positive management plan specifically aimed at him. At present, a prisoner is simply examined by a doctor on arrival but there is no consultation with him or any attempt to implement a programme of management to ensure he derives maximum benefit from his time in prison and to prepare him for release. Such a programme would incorporate a prisoner's skills, training and education or lack thereof to enable him to be re-integrated into society. This would be done in consultation with the prisoner and monitored throughout the sentence concluding in a preparation period prior to release.</P>
    <P>The underlying aim would be to ensure that the prisoner did not re-offend. Prior to release, there would be a link up with the local authority to ensure that housing would be provided where it was needed and with the social welfare system to ensure that money would be in the prisoner's pocket on release without having to wait eight or nine weeks as at present. Part of sentence management, particularly in relation to training, would be temporary release so a prisoner could attend a course, for example. Projects embarked on in prison would as far as possible be continued in similar projects on the outside so that there would be a seamless transfer from the activities inside prison to those outside. This is clearly outlined in the report but there is no reference to it in the Bill. We should bear in mind a written submission from one of the prisoners to the report team:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" />The word &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo; comes from the Latin &ldquo;to make able&rdquo;. This is your chance. Give us the incentive to change. Help make us able to survive in today's society and give us a chance to succeed in a normal life. The re-integration of prisoners into society would become easier. Ex-prisoners would have the skills to carve out their own nook and education to survive. Do not wait until we are near release or relapsed to try and change us. Start at the beginning. Make the change our own choice and it will become part of our psyche. Most of us do not want to be what we are and that is the point. Give us the sentence and watch the change.</P>
    <P>The proposals recommended in the report are to increase the use of non-custodial options; increase emphasis on re-integration; introduce positive sentence management and involve all stakeholders; develop more planned and integrated after care for prisoners on release; end discrimination on the basis of a criminal record bar in exceptional circumstances, as is the situation in Britain; increase data gathering, monitoring and independent evaluation to better inform police policy and use planned temporary release to aid re-integration. None of that is here nor anything about a wider purpose for temporary release. It merely lays down specific criteria without a model when we need one that would include the agencies such as PACE, Pathways and Connect.</P>
    <P>There is an excellent model in Cabra, in my constituency, where a project locates all people from the Dublin 7 area who are in State institutions so as to make contact with and visit them in prison. They offer facilities to assist and advise them on release in the locality. This is an example of a community reaching out to those who offended there or elsewhere so as to assist them to re-integrate into the community. If we have sentence management in prison linked to a community based scheme, such as in Cabra, then the local community can assist in rehabilitating released prisoners. This could work for 80% to 90% of the prison population and cost much less than the present approach.</P>
    <P>This is not a long Bill as it has only two sections, but I do not understand some of the subsections, for example sections 2(2)(<i>c</i>)(i) and (ii) and 2(2)(<i>d</i>). It says that one of the criteria of release is to ensure the good government of the prison concerned. Why would a prisoner be released to ensure the good government of the prison concerned? That is a strange ground on which to release a prisoner. The prisoner is the problem yet he or she is to be released back into society because we have problems with the 1:1 ratio of prisoners to prison officers. That does not make any sense. If there was not adequate control in a particular prison, surely it would be sensible to transfer the prisoner to another prison, not release him or her. I do not know what the Minister is trying to do in relation to that but it appears to be turning logic on its head.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" />Subsection 2(2)(<i>c</i>) deals with maintaining good order. It states that the reason for releasing a prisoner is to maintain good order in, and humane and just management of, the prison concerned. I thought the whole purpose of sending people to prison was to maintain good order in society. Why do we send people to prison? There are more staff than prisoners in our prisons, yet they cannot maintain good order. I do not know where our new Minister is coming from on this aspect. We know he is not a communist but what he is proposing here leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Subsection 2(2)(<i>d</i>) states that the Minister will release a prisoner if he is satisfied that the person has been rehabilitated and would, upon being released, be capable of reintegrating into society. That is not good enough. One aspect of the reason for temporary release that is recognised in every jurisdiction in the world where any sort of humane system operates, is that it is part of the rehabilitation. A prisoner is given a period out of prison for good behaviour, with the opportunity of attending a drugs or alcohol abuse course or some sort of FÁS training. That has always been the practice but under this section the Minister must be satisfied that the prisoner has already been rehabilitated.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making his position more difficult because if a released prisoner re-offends, and if the Minister is of the opinion that he or she has already been rehabilitated, surely there is a case for civil liability because the prisoner has not been rehabilitated. If the prisoner was rehabilitated, he or she would not have re-offended. In many ways the Minister is undermining the purpose of the Bill with this subsection and I would like to hear his response in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a contradictory position in section 2(2)(<i>k</i>) which states that one of the reasons for release is the likelihood that any period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his or her prospects of obtaining employment. The Bill already states that the prisoner must first be rehabilitated and yet this section states that part and parcel of the ground for prisoner release on a temporary basis is rehabilitation and reintegration into society.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill comprising only two sections. I do not know who to blame for it &ndash; the parliamentary counsel's office or the Minister, although I presume the parliamentary counsel is working on the basis of the Minister's direction. In any event there are some flaws in the Bill which undermine its entire purpose, even though part of that purpose was not stated by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State introduced a new element towards the end of his address which has come out of the blue. He should have given some notice to the spokespersons of a substantial new matter that is not in the Bill and that was not flagged in any way. I refer to the section relating to the Schengen convention where the Minister is proposing to table an amendment on Committee <Col N="1574" /> Stage to allow for sentences to be carried out in the state to which the offender has absconded and of which he or she is considered to be a national. Can we get clarification on that? Is the Minister proposing that the person will serve the sentence in the country to which he or she has absconded only if he or she is a national of that country? If that is the case, what consideration do we give to the particular regime in that country? We have always made it a condition that we would not send people back to regimes where capital punishment may operate. The Schengen convention may not even apply in such cases and there are types of sentences which may be abhorrent to our jurisdiction. Will we send prisoners back willy-nilly? How will we ensure that they will serve the sentence they were due to serve in this jurisdiction? The Minister is silent on how that will work. I would have liked a note, prior to the taking of the Bill in the House, on what was intended under the Schengen convention proposals which we have only just seen.</P>
    <P>Other countries have a statutory parole board to deal with these matters; Britain has had one for a long time. Indeed, Ireland used to have a parole board. The Minister has set up an interim parole board simply for long-term prisoners and he stated that in the future he may put it on a statutory basis. Currently the Minister has all statutory power in this matter but it is not right that a Minister should have the full authority in relation to whether somebody is released. Other jurisdictions have a statutory parole board on which appropriate people sit to carry on the business. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a busy person. He is probably the busiest of all Ministers in the Government and it is very unlikely that he would have much opportunity of examining any individual case. We should establish the board on a broader basis to review not just long-term sentences but also the whole area of releases. We should broaden it further into examining the question of prison management.</P>
    <P>Every prison should have a business plan in regard to the way it operates and a prisoner management plan geared towards managing the sentence of each prisoner with a view to maximising resources and time, which all prisoners have a great deal of when they are inside. They are locked up for 16 hours a day and that time should be maximised so that there is some possibility of them becoming better citizens when they are released and having a chance not to re-offend. We should work proactively in that direction.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Bill, which is very narrow. The opportunity existed to do a decent job but it was not grasped. There is no commitment from the Minister, who has promoted himself as a reforming Minister, to do anything substantial in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath and Cuffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" />I have certain misgivings about this Bill. I recognise that it establishes an infinitely more transparent basis for the system of temporary release of prisoners. Many prisoners on temporary release feel they are in a strange form of limbo; they can play at being normal but they are not actually free. When is a prisoner not a prisoner? When he or she is on temporary release. Being allowed to walk unescorted through the prison gate after so long may feel both normal and strange.</P>
    <P>As the governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan, has so often observed, prisoners who have their own agendas have a measure of control over the way their lives inside prison will develop. He also stressed the need for making their sentences as positive an experience as possible. His reasoning was that they would then see imprisonment as a means to an end.</P>
    <P>A prisoner should be able to live in prison and not merely do time. The time then comes to think about living on the outside and this is the period of transition. Options should exist on the outside for undertaking supervised voluntary work. Places should be available in charity shops or with helping the less able members of society, such as the sick or the elderly. Organisations catering for people with special needs could provide another fertile ground for the involvement of temporary release prisoners. They could use some of the skills acquired in prison such as typing or IT and communications skills. Eventually real freedom or liberation beckons. A temporary release will be seen as merely an extension of the boundaries.</P>
    <P>I recall once travelling by train to Reading from London. The train passed by Reading gaol and I reflected that there was no system of temporary release in operation when Oscar Wilde languished there. The UK has a system of release on temporary licence. Compassionate, facility or resettlement licences all have different qualifying criteria. Prisoners must pass a risk assessment before being approved for a period of release on temporary licence. In some cases victims are consulted and informed about the period of the licence. I share the concern expressed earlier by Deputy Deasy about victims meeting their attackers when they have not known of the release from prison. This should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>One of the most important forms of temporary release in the UK is the resettlement release. Its purpose is to maintain family ties and links with the community and to make suitable arrangements for accommodation, work and training on final release. The institution of a commission to advise the Minister regarding the release of prisoners under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement is also a welcome development and will ensure that all those prisoners who qualify will secure their release.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland a ten day allowance scheme exists for prisoners who have completed ten years in custody. This leave can be taken as a <Col N="1576" /> ten day block or in shorter blocks of at least two days and it may not be added to Christmas home leave.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that prisoners can become institutionalised. It would be an injustice to the prisoner and to the public just to throw the prisoner out the prison door when his sentence is served. Much preparatory work before final release must be undertaken and temporary release programmes can play a part. Some people feel more secure inside prison and this must be addressed. People with psychiatric illnesses, for example, should be regarded as being misplaced in prison. A high level of counselling and rehabilitation services is needed in the prison system. We must try to prevent prisoners returning to prison and money spent in this regard would be very well spent. A stitch in time might save time in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate and it is essential that there is a detailed analysis of the question of temporary release of prisoners. I wish to approach the subject from a different angle. I speak as one who has been a teacher in the inner city for over 20 years and as a former full-time worker with the Simon Community.</P>
      <P>I wish to put a strong emphasis on dealing with prisoners and the causes of crime. Many people have made a lot of money researching this subject. The answer to the question of why people are in prison is very basic and straightforward; people are in prison because of massive poverty and massive disadvantage. Educational failure is also a factor as is the crisis situation in dysfunctional families where alcoholism and drug abuse is also present. A substantial minority of people with intellectual disabilities end up in prison. I strongly support prisoners' rights.</P>
      <P>I have worked in the inner city for 20 years. One of the best projects with which I was involved was breaking the cycle, for which I congratulate the Department of Education and Science. The project was set up to help the 33 poorest schools in the country. It provided us with resources and back-up staff, and above all it was a means of early intervention with four year olds. That was one of the most radical and progressive projects ever introduced since the introduction of free education by Donogh O'Malley and it should be further developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen children from crisis ridden and disadvantaged families participating in a choir which performed in the National Concert Hall. All the people in the flats went to the concert hall to see their children appear on stage and it gave the whole community a lift. It was a great occasion to see 1,000 children from the 33 poorest schools singing in the National Concert Hall. Officials from the Departments of Education and Science and from Finance were present to see how public money had been well spent. Over the five years of the programme the discipline and violence problems in many inner city schools were <Col N="1577" /> reduced. We used the extra &euro;7,000 a year for art therapy&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and I will speak about that in a moment. With a limited budget and limited resources we made a major effort to stop young people going to prison. We used our after school project fund of £3,000 for art therapy. We identified the five or six children most at risk who we thought were on their way &ldquo;to the 'Joy&rdquo;, as they say themselves. We used the resources to help deal with the feelings of anger of those young people. That is the way forward in preventing people ending up in prison. The keynote of my speech is the importance of early intervention. There cannot be a situation where in certain parts of this city only 1% of the children go to university. I know a few of that 1%. In some schools in Dublin 10% or 15% of the children end up in Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>I commend the work of John Lonergan, the governor of Mountjoy Prison. I commend the link he makes between education failure and literacy problems. He recommended that primary teachers should focus on these issues with the junior children. We all have responsibilities and I would be critical of my own profession sometimes because we must be aware of developing children's sense of self-esteem. The John Lonergan approach is the way forward. He treats prisoners as human beings with dignity, but he also ensures that they are given responsibility. That is the key in trying to make an effort with people who have been damaged by society. It is clear that 95% of the prisoners in this country come from economically disadvantaged areas. That is a reality we must face up to, and this is where the RAPID project comes in. We have got to ensure that this project is developing and evolving in every single priority area throughout the State.</P>
      <P>I am not advocating that seriously violent prisoners are released willy-nilly. Achieving a balance with public safety is a major issue. Any Bill of this nature has to be based on trust and good behaviour. I emphasise again the need to reward the good behaviour of people. If prisoners are out on temporary release and they deliver in terms of their behaviour then they should be rewarded. When we introduced our code of discipline in many schools in the inner city, we put a strong emphasis not on punishment of children who came from disadvantaged or crisis families but upon rewarding them when they made an effort to get out of that situation. Good practice should always be rewarded and developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2(1)(<i>b</i>) provides that a person may be temporarily released where, in the opinion of the Minister, circumstances exist to justify the release on health and other humanitarian grounds. We have got to ensure that people are released on humanitarian grounds. Section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) provides <Col N="1578" /> that a person may be temporarily released where, in the opinion of the Minister, the release is necessary. It is very important that we get involved in this.</P>
    <P>In section 2(2) we then see the considerations that the Minister must have regard to. Section 2(6) does not create entitlement to periods of further temporary release. This goes back to the whole question of trust and community as well as the whole question of who should be let out of prison. There should be very strong sentences for people who are charged with very serious drug offences, particularly the drug barons, because of the damage they do to wider society and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>When we consider the question of prisoners and the temporary release of prisoners, the whole issue of prisoners' rights and treating people with equality and dignity is always very important. I have got myself into a bit of controversy in the past few days over the Colombia three, and I am going to Colombia as one of the observers to support the right to a fair trial and to ensure the men's safety. I challenge Deputies Power and O'Donnell. That is the agenda we are going on, we are going to ensure a fair trial&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgraceful situation when one tries to preserve prisoners' rights, but I will carry on that Sean McBride tradition in this House. When prisoners are granted temporary release, the whole community should know and understand that these people have paid their price, but I like the idea of them giving something back to the community. This is an idea that should be used a lot, and there are many projects in England, Northern Ireland and here that provide examples of prisoners being made to get involved in community projects as a way of apologising to the community for the damage they have done. From talking to prisoners, I believe many of them would welcome this.</P>
      <P>While prisoners are in jail, the whole area of the arts should be developed. The musical and creative skills of prisoners have often been neglected over the years. I would challenge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the quality of this Bill. It is not up to scratch, there are major flaws in it. The Bill is not strong enough, so I will be voting against this legislation.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to talk about the number of adults with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, who are locked up in our prisons. As someone with direct experience of working in this field for ten years, and also as a parent, I find it disgraceful and unacceptable that we have people with disabilities in our prisons. It is a crime. People with disabilities should be in respite, residential facilities with proper community involvement and proper safety structures. It is also a human rights issue that adults with disabilities are locked away in prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" />This goes back to the whole question of early intervention. We have 18,000 young children with disabilities in our primary schools at the moment, and we can easily identify the ones at risk over a five or six year period. Prison is not part of the solution. I urge the Minister to think again about this Bill. I thank him for the opportunity of debating the Bill, but I shall be voting against it.</P>

      <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, comes to right his memoirs, I wonder whether the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill, 2001, will figure highly as one of the crowning points of his ministerial career. This Bill is a cynical exercise in protecting the State from potential law suits. It does nothing to improve the conditions in our prisons or to improve the conditions of those who find themselves behind bars.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy McGrath, I have experience of working in the inner city for the last ten years as a member of a city council. I can only concur with governor Lonergan of Mountjoy Prison. We know all to clearly from where his prison's past, present and future inmates will come. They come from very specific areas in this city, as they did five years ago and 20 years ago. If the Minister of State's current policies continue, they will still do so in 20 years' time. There is no serious attempt by the Minister of State to reform the Victorian institutions of the Irish Prisons Service. That is not to say that there are not some excellent individuals and some excellent programmes going on within the prison service, but there has not been any significant attempt to fundamentally reform the prison service.</P>
      <P>I wish we could move slightly further on in the whole discussion about why we are imprisoning people and what we are doing with them when they are in jail. As I look at this Bill going through I see threats to some of the brighter lights within the prison system. I hear rumours that Shanganagh Prison in my own constituency may well face cutbacks&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seriously concerned about that because that is one of the institutions that is actually trying hard to cope with younger people and to provide an alternative to the revolving door system. The Minister of State is presiding over the criminalisation of poverty. He is presiding over the criminalisation of social injustice, and he is not doing anything to combat the divides in Irish society that have brought about the imprisonment of people from a particular class or neighbourhood. We know those neighbourhoods and we know their class. If one looks at the historical figures, there has not been much of a change in the demographic make-up of the 3,500 guests of the nation today from ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sickening level of assistance to those prisoners once they leave the custody of this <Col N="1580" /> State, and it is for that reason as much as anything else that people very often find themselves back inside again. It is perhaps analogous to the issue of homelessness in our society. It is not so much a roof over their head that people need but a whole process of reform that needs to be entered into. That process of reform is not entered into to any great extent by the prison service. If a fraction of the &euro;7,000 that is spent on each prisoner every year was spent on investing in the neighbourhoods or families from which these people come, it would go a long way towards dealing with the root causes of criminality in society.</P>
    <P>I am worried that the Minister of State's Department is not prepared to undergo this process of reform. I am worried that he is not dealing with the fundamental problems that have been identified within the prison service. When the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited our prisons three years ago, its members reported that there was compelling evidence of brutality to prisoners; that prisons were overcrowded; that the current building programme would not provide a lasting solution; that little or no action had been taken against prison officers who ill-treated prisoners; that few facilities or services were provided for those prisoners; that the medical services provided to prisoners were below standard; and conditions in the Central Mental Hospital were condemned, especially the use of padded cells and seclusion rooms. That does not show any significant progress towards reform of the prison service.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is running scared. He would not even allow Amnesty International, a highly regarded non-governmental organisation, to visit our prisons. Countries such as the United States allowed Amnesty International to inspect its prison service. Why has the Minister of State refused to allow a highly respect organisation such as this to visit our prison service? Does he have something to hide?</P>
    <P>I worry about the boards that are set up to monitor, oversee and inspect our prisons. I worry that they have more to do with parochial politics and mileage allowances than with any serious attempt to address the problems of our society. If we are to see reform, we need a much better line up of people prepared to examine what goes on inside our prisons and to report on what they see there. I hope the Minister of State can bring about some changes in that regard.</P>
    <P>We know the neighbourhoods from which many prisoners in the custody of the State come. Those neighbourhoods, which have been identified, need proper housing, sports facilities, parks and playgrounds. A serious attempt must be made to address the level of disadvantage that exists, has existed and will continue to exist in those neighbourhoods unless action is taken.</P>
    <P>A serious attempt must also be made to address the level of drug use among prisoners. Scathing reports have been published on the degree of drug use among our prison population and reports have also been published on attempts <Col N="1581" /> to address it. Other countries have enlightened policies in this regard. Countries in Scandinavia and elsewhere in Europe seriously attempt to minimise such abuse engaged in by prisoners. They offer clean rooms for injecting and they deal with the serious reality of the problem. The previous Minister wanted to cover our prisons with fishing nets to prevent drugs being thrown into prisoners. They does not show any serious attempt to take an enlightened approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>Statistics on drug use make harrowing reading. It appears that 83% of female inmates have taken illegal drugs. Some 72% of the male prison population have taken illegal drugs and 68% of female prisoners have smoked heroin. These statistics are a damning indictment of the prison service and of any serious attempt to address the health concerns of prisoners, or to come to grips with the reasons people find themselves behind bars. Until the Minister addresses that issue, the problems of the prison service and of our prisoners will continue to manifest themselves in years to come.</P>
    <P>I do not see any serious attempt to come to grips with the level of disadvantage in the neighbourhoods from which our prisoners come. The position can be compared to the advertisement by Bernardos in that one can almost see the words &ldquo;future prisoner&rdquo; tattooed on the foreheads of five year olds in Dublin's inner city. I do not see the Minister of State making any serious attempt to combat this problem. Until such time as he addresses social disadvantage in particular communities in this city and elsewhere in the country, our prison population will continue to come from the same areas and will continue to be subjected to a revolving door system whereby there is no serious attempt at rehabilitation. The future of such children depends on the Minister of State making a serious attempt to reform our prison system rather than merely covering the State's liability in regard to prisoners who might be on early release.</P>
    <P>Of what is the Minister of State afraid? Why does he not examine good examples from abroad and what is going on in the rest of Europe? Good actions can be taken within the prison service and we want such measures taken. We want the disastrous issue of the imprisonment of adults with mental disability for years on end without any attempt to address the difficulties they encounter dealt with. We have yet to see a serious attempt being made at rehabilitation. There are many prisoners who say they would much rather stay in prison due to the lack of facilities available to cope with being back in society. That is a damning indictment of the problems faced by the prison service.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not an attempt to grapple with the wider issues surrounding prison reform, it is merely a cynical exercise in State protectionism. I wish to see those necessary changes made. We shall propose such changes, but until such time as we see the Minister of State attempting to deal <Col N="1582" /> with the wider issues, we will have to oppose the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues raised during this debate are important and I welcome the opportunity to discuss them. The Long Title refers specifically to an Act to provide for the temporary release of persons serving sentences of imprisonment, or of detention in St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week, which read &ldquo;Youth begs to be freed from jail drug culture&rdquo;. Effectively, a young person who asked to be put into St. Patrick's Institution to be protected from another issue had to be go before the court to plead to be released from there because of the drugs culture that existed there, which was claimed in court to be all pervasive. The judge allowed the prisoner to be released from that institution. When he asked the boy if there were more drugs in the jail than out on the street, the boy said they are all around the place. The Minister of State has a duty, in the first instance, to protect all prisoners, particularly those under the age of 18 in St. Patrick's Institution, from the pervasive drug culture that is claimed to exist and which has not been denied. This is a critical issue.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the drugs programme generally and the commitment to increase the budgetary allocation of the Minister, Deputy Ó Cúiv, to tackle the drugs problem, but not enough is being done in the prison system to stop young people, in particular, from getting involved in the drug culture. The Minister of State must be held responsible and must take responsibility for what is going on in these institutions.</P>
      <P>An offender who pleads guilty before the courts can, on conviction, opt to go before Mr. Justice Haughton who presides over the drugs court. I attended the court recently and observed it treats convicted prisoners in a most emphatic and positive way. I am talking about convicted offenders who have not committed any physical injury but who, for want of a better description, are persistent drug offenders and petty criminals. I saw the way such convicted offenders, who would otherwise be in prison, are dealt with fairly and firmly by Judge Haughton and his team of social workers, officers from the probation and welfare service, medical people and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This drugs court only applies to Dublin inner city but its influence should be extended throughout Dublin city and the country as soon as possible. We need to find a new way to deal with persistent drug offenders. Rather than send them to jail and enact temporary release Bills, if we extended the drugs court to other areas, particularly to young categories of prisoners who are not hardened criminals, it would be an important and constructive intervention in their lives. They deserve a second chance. The way the drugs court operates gives people in these categories the opportunity to change their lives. If one attends the drugs court &ndash; I urge Members to do so &ndash;<Col N="1583" /> one will see people who have changed utterly because of the system within which they are placed. It is not a soft option or treating criminals lightly as it places them under a lot of pressure to meet deadlines, to become involved with social workers, to attend their doctor and to get urine samples taken. They must be drug free, in particular heroin free, at all times. There are approximately 14,000 heroin addicts in Dublin city of whom 6,000 are on methadone treatment. I do not know how many hundred of them are in jail. It is a serious issue which must be properly addressed. I urge the Minister of State to reflect on what his Department must do in regard to the drugs court, in particular.</P>
    <P>Families of convicted criminals come to me as their public representative to make representations on behalf of family members looking for temporary release or to be moved from one prison to another for various reasons. When we write to the Minister &ndash; it is proper we should so &ndash; about these issues, it can sometimes be misconstrued that we are attempting to get a prisoner out of jail. The Minister is objective when he makes a decision whether to grant somebody temporary release and he acts in a proper or quasi-judicial way. A Member of the House has an obligation to make representations to the Minister but perhaps representations to get prisoners temporary release for what are assumed to be good and valid reasons could be made to another body instead. I am not saying there should be an ombudsman for prisoners, because that implies a wrong has been done, but there should be a body, perhaps the probation and welfare service, which does an excellent job, to which one could write and which would give the information through the proper channels to the Minister. This process should not be seen as political or something a politician does to get somebody out of jail or out on temporary release. There should be a body to which the family of a prisoner may make their case properly and in an above board manner. That is something which should be done as it would dispel the belief some people might have that there is political interference in these issues when, in fact, the politician is looking for a body which would make the representation to the person who makes the decision.</P>
    <P>I visit the District Court occasionally, and have done so for some years as a teacher. One will see that members of families who were before the District Court ten years ago are again before the courts, whether brothers, sister, uncles, aunts or whoever. I agree with other speakers who said it is possible to say that most of the prisoners in Mountjoy Prison or St. Patrick's Institution come from six electoral divisions in Dublin. The same can be said of those in other institutions. We must intervene as early as possible, particularly in terms of education. A lot more resources should be put into the communities and I acknowledge the work done in towns like my own, Drogheda, where schools and voluntary organisations have <Col N="1584" /> come together in disadvantaged areas. There are homework clubs and places to which families can go. Children can get breakfast in the morning, go to school, return in the evening for a meal and remain for a study period. There is constructive and positive intervention in areas of social disadvantage and economic deprivation. This is a way in which we can constructively and positively intervene to help these families and keep them out of prison because when somebody goes into prison, the door is closed on their lives. Indeed, even on conviction in court, the door is often closed on their lives forever.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about those who receive severe sentences, which have their place, as criminals who get such sentences deserve them. There are, however, people who end up with a conviction for a minor misdemeanour, such as aggravated horseplay or a minor public order offence. In later years when they grow up, have a family and want to go to somewhere like America, they find they cannot do so because the conviction is forever on their record. Again, I stress that I am not talking about serious criminals but about those who have received minor convictions who should, after a period of say seven years, be able to apply to the court in which they were first convicted to have their name taken off the register based on constructive and positive arguments, the most important of which should be that they have stayed out of trouble since their conviction. They should also have a reference from their local garda or community organisations. This would give people who have been convicted of minor offences a second chance. I understand other jurisdictions allow that and it could be done here.</P>
    <P>The question of the temporary release of prisoners can be fraught and difficult. There are many instances in which it is proper. Interventions by the State can be constructive and the thinking in the probation and welfare service is better than many of us appreciate until we come in contact with it. I recently visited Mountjoy Prison and spoke to Governor Lonergan. I fully support the views expressed about his enlightened view on prisoners and jail. We need to reassess the system and to look again at the way we treat these offenders. This Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill is important, although I know many people have pointed out faults in it. We must find a mechanism to deal with minor offenders in a more constructive way by taking a more long-term view of society. A conviction for a minor offence should not remain on someone's record ten years on.</P>
    <P>When he took office the Minister, Deputy McDowell, spoke about increasing the number of convictions for drug offenders to 8,000 per annum. While I fully agree that the full force of the law should be used to go after people who sell drugs, we must look at the way his views will impact on the lives of the 14,000 people in this city who take heroin.</P>
    <P>Whatever his views on it, the hand of justice should be tempered with some wisdom, in the <Col N="1585" /> case of the drugs court where there is another method found so that on conviction there is an alternative. I met a parent in the well of the drugs court whose third child was the first one to become heroin free. She spoke to everybody in the court about the wonderful difference the drugs court had made to her life.</P>

      <Quest>if in view of spending Estimates for 2003, he will be publishing revised target dates for the delivery of the health strategy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23104/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2001, I launched a comprehensive strategic plan for the health system. The national health strategy has been widely welcomed for the consultation process involved in devising it, its comprehensiveness, its long-term outlook and its in-built flexibility to allow for local ownership and environmental changes over its lifetime. This is the essence of a good strategic plan.</P>
      <P>This is a seven to ten year plan and several key actions will take the full ten years to implement, such as the primary care strategy. The action plan and target dates enable systematic monitoring of progress in the achievement of the type of world class health system envisaged. At the reconvened national consultative forum held on 11 November last I outlined, with the help of Department officials and senior health board staff, a detailed inventory of investment and the associated service developments and changes in practice which have emerged in the last year, in line with the new strategic direction. I will be reporting to the Cabinet committee on the health strategy very shortly.</P>
      <P>Many of the actions which are front-loaded in the action plan are concerned with detailed policy development or review for specific care areas, as well as showing a strong early start on the investment programme necessary to reconfigure our capacity around primary care and community services while ensuring that there is greater equity in the provision of acute hospital services. A strong showing has already been made in this regard with additional funding for the acute and primary care sectors in 2002, as well as significant investment, in particular, in services for older people, mental health and disability services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following provisions have been made in 2003: &euro;53 million for bed capacity; &euro;31 million for the treatment purchase fund; &euro;29 million for cancer services; &euro;4.5 million for the heart-lung programme; &euro;43 million for the waiting list initiative; &euro;25.7 million for acute hospitals pressures and <Col N="1586" />&euro;10 million for the ongoing development of the primary care model and GP co-operatives. There is also additional funding for mental health, disabilities, older people and children's services. It must be remembered that this is on top of the biggest increases in health expenditure in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The strategy acknowledges the need to change, improve and develop certain aspects of the way the system operates. Almost 50 actions in the action plan are concerned with the reform agenda. Achievements of a great many of these reforms do not require funding. They require a re-engineering of existing processes to focus on the new priorities and to focus more on the patient and client as being at the centre of the care process.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>I expect these targets to be met. Never has the need for maximum efficiency, value for money and accountability been more acute, and these concepts are well-embedded into the philosophy and practical actions of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Work is under way to ensure that strategic and service planning is in place at regional and organisational levels. This means that service plans have the strategy's goals and objectives fully embedded as part of the everyday routine of health service delivery. The implementation of the strategy is not a parallel stream of activity, it is the way business will be conducted in the system from now on. The development of processes to fully capture, monitor and evaluate system improvement and change through the planning process is also under way. Other organisational reforms, such as the establishment of the health boards' executive, also provide renewed focus on the efficiencies and improved consistency across the system to be gained from conjoint working.</P>
    <P>There remains a long agenda. Key initiatives which will inform and advance the reform agenda include the ongoing work of the consultants charged with the audit of structures and functions of the health system. I have already described the purpose and scope of the audit to the House in some detail. It is now well under way and has just entered its consultative phase. Its primary focus is to establish the organisational improvements needed to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and growth, modernisation and reform set out in the Quality and Fairness Strategy document. A report is expected very early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Work has begun on over 70 of the 121 actions in the strategy action plan. While the pace of the introduction of some elements of the strategy which require significant investment may vary, this is not the case for many other elements. While we will, of course, take stock of progress over the medium term, it is not my intention to publish revised dates for the delivery of the health strategy at this time. There is no doubt that implementation of the strategy involves chal<Col N="1587" /> lenges for everyone in the health system. Its implementation must be underpinned by strong management of the economy. That is our best guarantee that the health strategy will be delivered on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that this is a strategic long-term plan, nevertheless, the targets in it were set by him. The Estimates will clearly not fund the targets for next year, and many targets have already been missed for this year, such as that to provide additional beds. At the stroke of a pen this has become next year's target because it was not achieved this year. There is no funding for the expansion of the medical card scheme. I could give the Minister endless examples. Is he not concerned about the morale of the almost 100,000 workers in the health service, quite apart from patient considerations, who have bought into the strategic plan and who now see that the targets are not being met for a second year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that at all. In fact, this is the first plan in which targets were included. The earlier strategy in 1994 did not have any timetable for implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It had commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Target dates are important and place significant pressure on providers, the Department and myself to do everything possible to meet them. At the conference on 11 November we estimated that work has begun on up to 70% of the 121 actions, which is significant progress in 12 months.</P>
      <P>In terms of the beds referred to by the Deputy, it was our aim to try to provide 709 beds, which is in excess of the strategy. The strategy itself provided for only 450, which itself was significant in the first year. I am informed by the health boards that they will reach the target of 600 this year and 109 early in the new year. The key point is that no one said at any stage that we would have 600 beds by January or, indeed, by the middle of 2002. We have to provide for the full year costing of the bed capacity in 2003. It is stated in the Estimates that it will now cost &euro;118 million to commission 709 public beds in 2003. That has necessitated an additional &euro;53 million over and above last year's provision in order to meet the full 12 month costs of beds that have been put in place this year. It is the first time in 20 years that we have had any kind of concerted increase in hospital beds in the public sector.</P>
      <P>The organisational reform agenda is also important. Some 50 actions in the national health strategy revolve around reforms which do not involve significant costs and we are aiming to implement them as well. The strategy is one of reform and investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sound fiscal strategy is the ultimate guarantor of the delivery of the health strategy. Any <Col N="1588" /> alternative, such as the fiscal strategies we experienced in the 1980s would truly consign it to oblivion.</P>

I do not accept the projections made for 2003 in regard to the acute hospital system. Over the past two years alone, the base funding that is in place for the secondary care side of the hospital system is far greater than anything before. It is important to remember&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board has advised my Department that the ambulance service in the region is operating to an agreed protocol in relation to the transfer of medical emergency cases to the nearest hospital site. It has further advised my Department that no such comment, suggesting that there is a potential 5% <Col N="1589" /> acceptable level of mortality in medical emergencies in relation to the transfer of patients, was made by its medical adviser.</P>

      <P>My information is that it was stated by people who attended a meeting in Kells to an audience of 1,500 people who were concerned about the services at Monaghan General Hospital. It was also widely reported in the paper that there was a potential for fatalities in 5% of cases. In view of the reckless disregard in respect of medical and surgical emergencies in County Monaghan, will the Minister inform me whether the NEHB has any policy objectives in relation to patients in the county?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that while beds are still being closed in Monaghan, there is no policy in the North Eastern Health Board for an upgrading of services in other hospitals throughout the north-east to care for these extra requirements? Is the Minister aware of the musical beds scenario in the North Eastern Health Board whereby patients are transported from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and Dublin or from Monaghan General Hospital to Dundalk, only to find there is no bed available, and back to Monaghan? Lives have been lost and this life threatening merry-go-round continues as a result of the downgrading of services at Monaghan General Hospital. Maintaining services in Monaghan could offset the expenditure involved in transferring patients to other hospitals. Is the Minister happy to preside over such a policy?</P>
      <P>Is he aware in regard to the treatment purchase scheme agreement signed with the NHS more than 12 months ago, we are buying products that we were selling to the UK at the beginning of the year? Routine surgery was being performed for hernias, varicose veins&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the substantive elements of the questions, I need to clarify the allegation in terms of the statement by the medical adviser to the North Eastern Health Board. The question tabled by the Deputy states the adviser allegedly said there is a potential 5% acceptable level of mortality. We have consulted the health board and it denies such a statement was made. The board stated no such comment suggesting there was a potential 5% acceptable level was made. I do not know whether interpretations are being put on what was said but the statement needs to be clarified. We will not do that today but I have been informed that no such statement was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" />The Deputy stated there could be a possible 5% level which is different to &ldquo;acceptable level&rdquo;. The question almost implies the medical adviser said there was an acceptable level of mortality in such scenarios. That is a strange statement to make and it should be clarified in fairness to the medical adviser.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the question I tabled. My concern was that the Monaghan hospital alliance met the medical adviser and deputy chief executive officer of the health board. It was the first such meeting ever with the medical adviser and during it he indicated that in 95% of cases there would be no difficulty with ambulance transfers from Monaghan. However, he stated that in the other 5% of cases resulting from serious accidents and so on, there was the potential for a 5% mortality rate. The group was concerned when he stated that, in the pursuit of best practice and patients' interests, this could happen and so be it.</P>

      <P>The question used the word &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; and that puts a totally different gloss on it. We can resolve this issue later.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other issues raised, a proposal was put on the table last September and views were sought from the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Anaesthetists. That latter group, in particular, has endeavoured to be co-operative in attempting to arrive at a resolution to the issues in Monaghan. I am not happy that elective surgery cannot take place there. Given the investment in facilities at the hospital, particularly in the new surgical unit which cost more than £1 million, we want them to be used.</P>
      <P>Compromise is needed and pending further talks and discussion, agreement is needed on an interim basis on the template that was provided in September because the vast majority of cases are dealt with by day. The number of surgical procedures that take place late at night is minimal. I wonder why there is such a dispute. We must also develop a Cavan-Monaghan axis in terms of training and accreditation. People must realise that future accreditation and training will be dictated by the criteria set down by the colleges of training, not by me or the health board. We must work with them to develop acceptable templates for training and accreditation. The Cavan-Monaghan axis is one in that locality.</P>

      <P>Compromise is an art. We are having difficulty engaging in meaningful dialogue. I agree with the Minister that the vast majority of procedures take place between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. However, the most serious accidents occur <Col N="1591" /> between 9 p.m. and 3.30 a.m. and that has been borne out statistically.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the Government is not honouring its promise to extend eligibility for medical cards in order to bring in over 200,000 extra people; the steps he intends to take to meet the primary care needs of those on lower incomes who do not qualify for medical cards at present; if it is intended to increase the income limits for eligibility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23108/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret it will not be possible to meet this commitment for next year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within its lifetime. As the Deputy may also be aware the GMS scheme costs have increased by more than 29%, which will cost &euro;230 million extra for those currently availing of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in the issuing of medical cards in terms of deciding on hardship cases and so on and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. In addition, in July 2000 the medical card was extended to everybody over the age of 70 consistent with Government policy aimed at improving the position of the elderly.</P>
      <P>We have invested significantly in primary care through general co-operatives and the new primary care model that is part and parcel of the health strategy. I announced ten pilot projects earlier this year and will provide &euro;8 million in 2002 and 2003. There is a budget of almost &euro;27 million for the new 24 hour GP co-operatives and the primary care initiative. I regret we are not in a position to extend the medical care scheme next year. I do not have the financial envelope to do so. However, we are undertaking an examination of the GMS scheme in terms of underlying trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept his refusal to honour promises made in the health strategy to medical practitioners and the electorate to extend the medical care scheme to people who desperately need it has caused deep distress to those directly affected? Does he also <Col N="1592" /> accept he cannot even convince the Minister for Finance that he has spent his budget wisely? He questioned the Minister's ability to spend money wisely on the health service, which is unprecedented. Does he agree the GMS scheme was recognised as good value in the value for money audit, unlike his Department which was not considered to deliver good value for money?</P>
      <P>Is he aware that the full cost of extending the scheme to the 200,000 people who were promised such by Fianna Fáil is only &euro;150 million, which is a fraction of what the Government is spending on the SSIA scheme and only half of what it will cost the Exchequer when it reduces corporation tax? Does this not raise questions in his mind regarding his priorities? Does he accept the decision to refuse to extend the scheme, which means a single person with an income of &euro;132 a week is still denied a medical card, is an indication of a callous and cruel con trick perpetrated on vulnerable people at the last election?</P>
      <P>They believed, sadly, that Fianna Fáil would deliver an essential change that would have transformed people's lives so they could afford to pay the doctor's bills when their children were sick and to purchase the medication they needed. Is the Minister not aware of the genuine anguish he caused when he failed to honour a specific commitment made before the election? He has not even delivered it in part. Would he not accept that had it been introduced now on a phased basis, it would have shown goodwill and serious commitment?</P>
      <P>Does he accept that, as a result of what has happened, the electorate does not believe him? His credibility is shot. He has denied people a provision that is good value for money, would not require renegotiated contracts, is still under the 40% the GMS scheme allows, is modest in cost and would have enormous health benefits for low income people, the working poor.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the allocation by his Department to suicide prevention programmes in 2000 and 2001 was 8.2% of the allocation to road safety, excluding expenditure by the Garda on enforcing traffic laws, despite the fact that more died by suicide than by road accidents; the reason there was a substantial reduction in expenditure on suicide prevention programmes in 2001 and 2002 in comparison with 2000; and his views on whether the Government is seriously ignoring the suicide crisis.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23107/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mistaken in his assertion that expenditure on suicide prevention programmes has been reduced in recent years. In fact, the opposite is the case. The level of additional funding being provided to health boards by my Department for suicide prevention has increased from &euro;190,000 in 1999 to &euro;3.8 million in 2002.</P>
      <P>Additional funding allocated to a service in one year becomes part of the baseline funding for that service in subsequent years. Therefore, since the publication of the report of the task force on suicide in 1998, a cumulative total of over &euro;8 million in additional funding has been provided towards suicide prevention and towards research aimed at improving understanding of this issue. These figures do not include funding provided by other Government Departments such as the Departments of Education and Science, Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform which were identified in the report of the national task force on suicide as having a role to play in suicide prevention.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on suicide recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to young people. Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people. In this regard, additional funding has been made available in recent years to further develop consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. Funding allocated to these initiatives is not recorded as expenditure on suicide prevention, but has a vital role to play in the area.</P>
      <P>Significant funding has also been provided for many voluntary organisations who deal with people suffering from depression, mental illness and bereavement who are at risk of suicide and attempted suicide. Again, this funding is not recorded under the heading of suicide prevention.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the national task force on suicide. Many of the recommendations of the task force, however, require continuous development particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention. I am fully committed to supporting suicide prevention programmes and the health strategy published last year includes a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" />The additional resources required to continue the work in suicide prevention and the further development of mental health services for individuals who may be at risk will be considered in the context of the overall determination of expenditure for mental health services for 2003 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>I cannot comment on the allocation of funds to road safety, as this is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Minister to Question No. 499 of 5 November in which he gave me the figures for suicide prevention and to the reply with regard to expenditure on road safety which I received from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. The Minister for Health and Children's reply outlined the expenditure on suicide prevention and they are the figures I received in early November. The Minister is now quoting other figures and I do not know why they differ.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the increase in the number of deaths by suicide, from an average of 65 in the early 1960s to an average of 450 in recent years, deserves much attention, investment and research? According to the national research foundation on suicide, a total of 10,000 people each year are treated in hospitals for attempted suicide. This is an epidemic that deserves attention and funding to find out why it is happening. We must introduce programmes to ensure these figures are reduced and to promote mental health services.</P>
      <P>Suicide is the most common cause of death in young people. Eighty per cent of deaths among young males are the result of suicide. Does the Minister not agree that his investment in mental health services and suicide prevention should be reviewed? Will there be an increase in expenditure on suicide prevention, as outlined in the reply I received on 5 November, given that the figures for 2001 and 2002 show a reduction on the figure for 2000? Will the Minister confirm that despite the cutbacks he has announced, this area will be ring-fenced and that there will be an increase in expenditure on suicide prevention and suicide research?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the figures, the Deputy might be talking about the rate of increase onto the base. The figures I have are: &euro;190,000 for 1999, &euro;1.5 million for 2000, &euro;1.054 million for 2001 and &euro;1.11 million for 2002. The total figure is &euro;3.878 million. That is the base. We are talking about adding to the base, and the rates of addition as opposed to the actual base figure. Those are the figures I have been given but I will clarify the matter for the Deputy later. Under the heading of child-adolescent psychiatry, for example, £1.75 million was the increase in 1999, and it increased fairly substantially afterwards. It was only £1.3 million in 2000 but it increased to £4.095 million in 2001, and up to &euro;6.061 million in 2002. The Deputy will agree that, historically, <Col N="1597" /> the whole area of child and adolescent psychiatry was sadly neglected in this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The current measure is one of the most effective ways of bringing such services to adolescents, and to children in particular, who constitute an important target group in dealing with parasuicide and suicide. Base funding for adult psychiatric services has also increased significantly in recent years. In 1999, only £203,000 was allocated to various voluntary groups, while this year we have given an additional &euro;1.5 million to the voluntary sector, bringing the total to &euro;3 million.</P>

      <Quest>the steps being taken to implement the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government, that people in all parts of the country will have reasonable access to cancer services; the additional resources being allocated to ensure this objective is met, having regard to the number of people suffering from or at risk of cancer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>One of the key goals of the health strategy entitled Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, is to make sure that equal access for equal need is a core value for the delivery of publicly funded services. Access in terms of timing and geographical location is also encompassed by this goal. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997, more than &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care <Col N="1598" /> services for people with cancer. Cancer services throughout the country have benefited from this investment, which far exceeds the £25 million requirement initially envisaged under the national cancer strategy.</P>
      <P>Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts in key areas, such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff.</P>
      <P>This year a total of &euro;27.3 million was provided for the maintenance and development of cancer services, some &euro;23.55 million of which was allocated between all the health boards. An additional sum of &euro;29 million is being allocated in 2003 for cancer services. This investment will ensure that next year we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services throughout the country in such areas as oncology/ haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to develop cancer services further, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003 is being developed by the national cancer forum in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. This strategy will set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services in the coming years, and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care, and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert review group on radiotherapy services. The forum is currently consulting with the ERHA and all health boards, as well as professional bodies, voluntary agencies, patient groups and members of the public, in relation to the future development of cancer services, including how best to organise these services.</P>

      <P>The report on breast cancer strategy, which designated 13 treatment centres, was published some time ago. When will the strategy be carried out and completed? As regards breast cancer screening, when does the Minister intend to extend BreastCheck to the next phase across the country? To reassure patients, will the Minister assure the House that there will be no attempt to refuse cancer treatment, including medication, to public patients, as was mentioned in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> newspaper? Many cancer patients are now desperately worried that they may be denied high-cost treatments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to ask about the radiotherapy unit in Waterford. The Minister should not refer the matter to the radiotherapy task force because the Minister has ultimate responsibility to deal with this serious lacuna. Will he define what is meant <Col N="1599" /> by reasonable access, which is the term used in the Government's programme?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to election promises and during the election campaign he made a commitment, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, to eliminate hospital waiting lists by 2004. Will he explain exactly how he intends to do that? </P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised about eight questions relating to cancer services and I will try to deal with them first. The Deputy referred to the establishment of symptomatic breast disease treatment centres, and progress has been made in that regard across the country. Consultants have been appointed to all health boards to work in areas such as oncology, breast surgery, histopathology and haematology. I have details of the progress that has been made in each health board area. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have it in writing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Deputy does not want me to put on the record the fact that we have made some progress on breast disease. I am anxious to see breast disease centres established in all health board areas, including the BreastCheck service. I have received the report from the BreastCheck board, but one important issue needs to be resolved. The BreastCheck board has indicated to the Department that, irrespective of the establishment of the symptomatic breast disease centres, if a patient is screened, for example, in Donegal &ndash; where there is an excellent breast disease treatment centre &ndash; they would have to travel to Dublin or elsewhere to avail of the BreastCheck facilities. That issue has to be resolved between the Department and the BreastCheck board. Lines have been drawn on the issue and people have strong views about it. I do not see the logic of the Department establishing teams in centres of excellence across the country, thus having an alternative treatment system linked to the BreastCheck screening programme. The obvious thing to do from a policy viewpoint is to merge both services. We will have to resolve that matter prior to the expansion of BreastCheck nationwide. We hope to be in a position to expand BreastCheck in 2003. The BreastCheck board has told us that it will take about two years from commencement to get everything in place <Col N="1600" /> to expand the service to the remaining half of the country.</P>
      <P>As regards oncology drugs, there is an onus on us not to hype this matter, which was mentioned in <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> out of all proportion. There was a memo, apparently relating to a remark made by one&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue, a Leas Cheann Comhairle, if I may continue. Members of the House would wish me to put on the record the fact that no cap will be placed on any oncology drugs. At present, we operate by clinical autonomy and we have attracted top-class consultants back to this country. We have more oncology consultants now than ever before and because more such people are practising at the coalface, the bill for drugs is going through the roof. I would like to establish a body, such as the national information on quality authority, to ultimately evaluate for the State what new drug therapies should be applied, and when, on the basis of best medical evidence and in accordance with international protocols. This should also be the case concerning emerging new health technologies. The country is lacking such a facility at present but my policy is clear &ndash; if patients require oncology drugs as prescribed by their clinician, they will have them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>A very dangerous departure, if I may say so. In proceeding, we must be guided by best medical practice regarding the best outcomes for patients. We need a genuine national debate about this but I am not pre-empting what will happen when we get the report in January. I am not making any decisions prior to receiving the expert review group's publication in January but I appeal to all sides of the House to ensure we have a reasonable, rational debate on this issue. We must strike a balance between convenience and access, which are important to patients, and <Col N="1601" /> how we can guarantee the best outcomes for patients in terms of treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately, this is what we want. We want to improve cancer survival rates and to enhance the facilities we have, which are not where we want them to be now. We must take on board the expert international clinical protocols coming our way. The outcomes in America and elsewhere are indisputable; the incomes there are better than they are here. It is easy to go down the political route and we are all susceptible to it, no matter what party we are from, but we have a responsibility to inform the public of the choices that have to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 36, 75 and 169 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This <Col N="1602" /> should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation, I regret it will not be possible to meet this commitment for next year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within its lifetime. As the Deputy may also be aware, the present GMS scheme costs have increased by over 29% which will cost &euro;230 million extra for the present people availing of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>The strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency.</P>
    <P>The health strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. A series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services. Shorter waiting times for public patients is prioritised, with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of a treatment purchase fund. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people, initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug abusers, asylum seekers-refugees and prisoners and implementation of the NAPS targets relating to health also.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>In July 2000 the medical card was extended to everybody over the age of 70. The extension of medical cards to the over 70s is wholly consistent with Government policy aimed at improving the position of the elderly. Access to primary care services is of crucial concern to this Government as is shown in the new primary care model. Primary care is the first port of call for the majority <Col N="1603" /> of people who use health services. It can meet 90-95% of all health and personal social service needs and is a vital public service. People want community-based, well integrated, round-the-clock services that are easy to reach. They want themselves, their family members and their communities put right at the centre of care delivery. The primary care strategy sets out a vision of the service we want to put in place building on our existing strengths, to develop a high quality, userfriendly primary care service to meet people's needs into the future. However, change will not be effected overnight. The strategy sets out an implementation plan, which recognises the breadth of the change which will be required in order to support the rolling-out of the new primary care model over the next decade.</P>
    <P>As the new model is developed, a wider primary care network of other primary care professionals will also provide services for the population served by each primary care team. This will enable us to see, in a real and practical way, how the new model will operate in practice, the benefits which we hope will flow from this new way of working and to explore some of the implementation issues in a practical way. This is, of course, only one of the first steps along the way. The implementation period recognises that there are major structural changes which must occur in order for the new primary care model to be implemented. It is also necessary to ensure that the required numbers of health professionals are trained and retained in the system over the coming decade and beyond to meet anticipated needs.</P>
    <P>Following an extensive consultation process with disadvantaged groups carried out under the auspices of the working group on NAPS and health, NAPS health targets have been included in Building an Inclusive Society: Review of the National Anti Poverty Strategy under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, published by the Government earlier this year. Key health targets are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by 10% by 2007 and to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest of the population. Policy measures for implementing these targets as outlined in the framework document for the NAPS review and the report of the working group on NAPS and health, have been taken on board in the national health strategy.</P>
    <P>One thousand people waiting for more than 12 months have now had operations under the national treatment purchase fund. By the end of the year 1,900 will have been treated. This will contribute significantly to reducing hospital waiting lists in the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not possible to extend the medical card coverage to additional groups, will the Minister at least consider raising the eligibility level in line with growth and income levels in the economy? People would then not have to <Col N="1604" /> give up jobs to hold on to their medical cards. Is it not particularly cruel that people who had medical cards are losing them while those who expected medical cards are not getting them? At the same time the Minister is raising the threshold for the drug refund scheme. That subhead is being savaged, which is totally inconsistent with what is promised under the primary care strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the commitment was to increase income thresholds to such a level that we were bringing in approximately 200,000 extra people. As I have said, the financial envelope I have this year does not allow me to do so. There would obviously be cost implications and the envelope I have allows me to do certain things. I prioritised the beds and acute hospitals services issues to ensure people have better access to treatment in our acute hospitals. I have prioritised cancer services with an additional &euro;29 million and I have prioritised waiting lists through a combination of the mainstream waiting list initiative with &euro;43 million and the treatment purchase fund, which will have approximately &euro;30 million at its disposal. Approximately 7,000 additional patients are expected to be treated under this next year and those are people waiting longer than 12 months for a variety of treatments. That will significantly reduce waiting times for those people.</P>
      <P>That is what I have done with the envelope at my disposal; unfortunately that is the position for 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND" hpid="Dr. Twomey Dr. Twomey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity to comment on the Estimates but in the spirit of the Government's defence, I ask the Minister to comment on the fact that in 1997 37% of the population had medical cards while in 2001 that figure had dropped to 31%. Will the Minister comment on the recent problem of overpayment involving 15,000 medical cards? Who does he feel was responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter, the principal reason the number of people holding medical cards declined from 37% to 31% was the economic growth in the country and the fact that approximately 300,000 people secured employment between 1997 and now. Obviously if one secures employment one's income increases and the vast majority of people with medical cards who secured employment then exceeded the threshold. It is equally true that in the same period a significant additional number of people benefited from the DPS scheme compared to previously. The budget for that scheme has rocketed between 1999 and now. That is the main reason the percentage of people with medical cards declined &ndash; the dramatic economic growth and growth in employment meant people's income limits went up accordingly, thereby putting them over the threshold for eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding medical cards, we will be entering negotiations with the relevant bodies, such as the <Col N="1605" /> IMO, but the bottom line from the exercise undertaken is that over 15,000 cards were invalid. Many of the holders were dead or had moved to other locations. Subsequent validation is taking place for those under 70. A serious situation that has been uncovered and I have heard various public pronouncements but to be fair &ndash; the Deputy himself is a GP &ndash; one would expect GPs would know if people on their list died.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND" hpid="Dr. Twomey Dr. Twomey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>How many died?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, there are issues of computation and so on. The bottom line is that no matter who is blaming who, in essence, 15,000 people had ghost medical cards. That is what has emerged from the validation study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all disabled children are getting medical cards. I know of one case I would like the Minister to re-examine &ndash; I have written to him about it before &ndash; involving a child with several handicaps who is being fed through a tube but because the child's parents earn a reasonable income, the child has no medical card.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting a married couple with three children on &euro;215 or &euro;220 a week can afford &euro;40 for a doctor's bill and &euro;60 for medicine? That is an impossible situation. Also, parents in my constituency do not have a children's ward available to them and must carry the cost of travelling to Cavan, Drogheda or elsewhere with their children. That is an added burden for those families. The children's ward has been closed for some time. I am not trying to play that up but the situation is very serious for those on low pay. I accept that medical cards for 200,000 people may not be possible but the Minister must make sure that those who have medical cards do not continue to lose them as is happening at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's comments on board. Regarding the individual cases, the chief executive officers of the health boards have discretion, in cases of hardship and where people have chronic or long-term illnesses, to award medical cards. In many instances they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>In some they do not, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot in many cases. It is not unlimited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was unlimited, but the numbers are so substantial that the Irish Medical Organisation saw fit to negotiate for a contribution from the State in respect of the additionality. The IMO has raised this issue from time to time. It is important that chief executive officers are allowed the flexibility to award medical cards, particularly in hardship cases such as those outlined by Deputy Crawford and in cases of chronic and long-term illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a variety of other support schemes. The long-term illness scheme, for example, assists <Col N="1606" /> people with a range of diseases and disabilities and is of assistance to families and children. The DPS is also of assistance to families and children. The 1999 amendment specifically allowed families to add the costs of individual members of the family as one cost in order that the refund kicks in when the total cost goes above the threshold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that 200,000 people are having to face the harsh reality of not having a medical card or the protection it offers, will the Minister state clearly what is likely to happen to the drugs refund scheme? Does he envisage additional price increases or a heightening of the threshold? What will happen to those on very low incomes who are having to pay their family doctor's bills and are very fearful? Already they have faced an increase in the drugs refund scheme and now face another. Will the Minister elucidate on the matter?</P>
      <P>While we all accept that doctors should know which of their patients have died, does the Minister accept that issues of accountability regarding how the system operates have been raised? It is the health boards which should have the information regarding numbers of patients. Does the Minister also accept responsibility for miscalculations? When the Department calculated the cost of the over 70s scheme, his assessment of the number of over 70s in the country was so out of line that that his figure turned out to be half the true figure.</P>
      <P>The Department was responsible for overcharging patients when the change was made in the drugs refund scheme and the old system, when two schemes were in place, was abolished. Nevertheless, it is refusing to pay back what is owed to the people concerned. Will the Minister comment on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The threshold of the drugs payment scheme will be increased. I am looking at various options in an attempt to bring forward a regime that will protect those on low incomes. I will let Deputies know the details as soon as the process is completed. We are modelling a variety of options. There will be increases in the drugs payment scheme, which has increased dramatically in line with increases in the GMS. Some of the increase relates to the ingredient costs and some to the way we changed the administration of the scheme at pharmacy level in 1999. There has been a vast increase in the numbers availing of the scheme since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there are accountability issues in terms of the number of ghost medical cards. That is the reason I brought in Deloitte &amp; Touche four or five weeks ago to make a critical examination of the governance and accountability mechanisms in the general medical services scheme and payments made by the GMS board on behalf of health boards. Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants will examine the roles and responsibilities of the Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and the GMS payments <Col N="1607" /> board. They will examine the underlying reasons for increasing cost trends in the medical card scheme, validate the latest estimated outturn for 2002 and assess its implications going forward and make recommendations for the immediate resolution of any identified weaknesses and inadequacies.</P>
    <P>The GMS scheme has been in place for 30 years. While it has changed, its fundamental governance has not. I accept that there is an accountability issue across the system which needs to be tightened up. With regard to the miscalculation of the number of over 70s, I do not estimate population trends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>The strongest recommendation made by Deloitte &amp; Touche in its audit of last year was the need for investment in IT systems. This and many other miscalculations of numbers of patients, and employees, in the health service indicate that it is essential that this investment is made. We must also invest in the provision of the single patient identifier card. If health boards, the GMS and doctors were all working off the same list and each patient had an identifier card, general practitioners would automatically know if a patient had moved from his or her practice or if a patient had died. Is this not the sort of investment we should be making in order that the blunders of recent months do not continue to occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy. One of the greatest deficiencies of our health system is in information and the lack of comprehensive databases across the system, both in the administrative and clinical areas. There have been sigificant improvements, in terms of HIPE data in acute hospitals for example, and we are better off than we were ten years ago. Nevertheless, there is a fundamental lack of a robust database, which the Deloitte &amp; Touche report identified. The national health strategy also identified this need during the consultation process. The Government is committed to the development of a national health information strategy for which we will be publishing the blueprint shortly. A central and essential part of the strategy is the unique patient identifier. More and more screening issues will arise in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We would benefit if we had an electronic patient record which could be accessed <Col N="1608" /> from primary to secondary and continuing care. There are data protection issues and legislation will be necessary. Public health should take precedence over other considerations and measures can be included to ensure civil liberties are safeguarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board area and on a national basis. In the short term I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year, of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional &euro;1.191million last year for orthodontic services, of which &euro;1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board proposes, <i>inter alia,</i> to recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of whom will be based in Tralee. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that it recently advertised this position through the Local Appointments Commission, but on this occasion no eligible applicants applied for it. The board will again consider the possibility of advertising the post at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Last June my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional &euro;720,000 from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</P>
      <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service. Ultimately, it <Col N="1609" /> will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</P>
    <P>This year, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are in addition to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. That is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions.</P>
    <P>These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit, thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has informed me that at the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 3,067 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of approximately 767 patients in orthodontic treatment compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that 1,000 people are awaiting treatment at the Tralee unit, there is a four year waiting list in that unit, there is a large number waiting for assessment &ndash; we are unsure of the figure &ndash; and that he promised in the Dáil to appoint a consultant orthodontist for the unit earlier this year? Although the Minister has outlined the investment in the orthodontic service, the service on the ground is deteriorating rapidly. Does he agree that there is an urgent need to ensure that the row in the orthodontic service between orthodontic consultants, dental colleges and his own Department be sorted out? If he spent some time solving that row&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies, including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>
      <P>Extensive research has, and continues to be, conducted world-wide in relation to the MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation has indicated that MMR vaccine does not cause autism and that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR.</P>
      <P>The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the existing research and medical evidence do not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" />The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee of the UK, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Recent studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years during which MMR vaccine was introduced. A recent UK study where researchers analysed some 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> published details of a study of more than 500,000 children born in Denmark between January 1991 and December 1998 which indicated that the risk of autism was the same for children regardless of whether or not they were vaccinated with MMR. On this basis, there are no plans for pre-testing children or delaying vaccination.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Earlier this year, newspaper articles alleging a link between MMR vaccine and autism referred to a study by Professor John O'Leary into measles virus. In response to these articles, Professor O'Leary issued a statement indicating that the research referred to in no way establishes any link between the vaccine and autism. He further indicated that he and his research team have consistently advocated the use of MMR vaccine to protect the nation's children from measles, mumps and rubella.</P>
    <P>MMR vaccine is in use world-wide. Most countries implement a two-dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The primary concern of my Department in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The Irish Medicines Board and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland support the use of MMR on the grounds that it has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective vaccine. There is sound evidence for the use of MMR in the national programme.</P>
    <P>The report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on childhood immunisation, published in July 2001, concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine.</P>
    <P>In order to reassure the public as to the safety of MMR vaccine and to address the negative <Col N="1615" /> coverage on this issue, which adds to the confusion of parents in deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children, I launched a document earlier this year entitled Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine Discussion Pack &ndash; an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the department of public health, Southern Health Board, and was published by the Health Boards Executive on behalf of the health boards. This document sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The pack addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism, the safety of the vaccine, combined versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine.</P>
    <P>Medical experts in my Department, in conjunction with relevant experts from the Irish Medicines Board, the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the National Disease Surveillance Centre review the latest developments and studies in relation to this and other vaccine issues. These bodies also provide expert advice and guidance to my Department on an ongoing basis on all vaccine-related issues. To date, there have been no reputable and validated studies which indicate a proven linkage between MMR and autism. I am not aware of any studies that have demonstrated a causal relationship between other vaccines and autism.</P>
    <P>The schedule of immunisation for the childhood immunisation programme is based on the recommendations and expert advice of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee is made up of experts from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health. The committee launched its revised Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland in October 2002 in which it addressed this issue and it has stated that there is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development of either inflammatory bowel disease or autism.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are an invaluable source of information to general practitioners and contain a substantial amount of detail regarding age for administration of vaccines, contraindications, etc. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation. Where parents feel they would like to discuss their concerns further, their general practitioner may refer them to a paediatric consultant.</P>
    <P>I urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the child<Col N="1616" /> hood immunisation programme to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response. However, would he agree that notwithstanding the various bodies he mentioned and the involvement of the Irish Medicines Board, we should not put the vaccination regime on such a pedestal or elevate it to a status where it is beyond question? Does he also agree that we should continue to monitor developments and ensure that the findings by the Autism Research Institute and other bodies are taken on board?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that parents of children should have access to whatever testing they consider necessary? One advantage of this is that they could decide what regime best suits their children who suffer from autism or these conditions. It will also help to dispel conspiracy theories which inevitably arise when people believe they are being denied access to the kind of tests which would determine the causes of their condition. In the context of the Minister's commitment to the vaccination regime this would be very helpful and it would to some extent address the lack of services available to parents of autistic children and others with conditions of this nature in at least establishing for them, in so far as it is possible, the causes of the conditions. It would also help to chart for them the kind of courses of treatment, educational provision or whatever else might be required for the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way we can professionally address this issue is on the available medical evidence. Any public health decision taken by the Minister must be grounded on the medical evidence available from studies that are peer reviewed and published. This kind of research is the key benchmark against which decisions are taken in this area. There is no international peer review publication of which I am aware that proves a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The studies I have outlined are significant, as are the international bodies that endorse the vaccine. They should not be lightly dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, Professor John O'Leary has made clear that the research in which he is involved in no way established any link between the vaccine and autism. He has further indicated that he and his research team have consistently advocated the use of MMR vaccines to protect the nation's children from measles, mumps and rubella. My Department has published a document entitled Measles, Mumps, Rubella &ndash; A Discussion Pack, which is an information guide for health professionals and parents. It was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Southern Health Board and was published by the Health Boards Executive on behalf of the board. It sets out the facts regarding the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help professionals and parents to explore them together, <Col N="1617" /> review the evidence and provide the basis for making an informed decision.</P>
    <P>In all cases where parents are in doubt we recommend they consult their GP and, if they consider it necessary and their child's medical history suggests it, a consultant paediatrician. As Minister I have no hesitation in saying that given the strong international endorsement by reputable medical and research bodies, the MMR vaccine is a very important public health measure.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the declining uptake of the vaccine. There was a measles epidemic in Dublin in 2000, involving 1,500 cases and three infant deaths, and there was an outbreak in Tuam in March and April this year with 20 cases. My main objective is to increase with the relevant authorities the uptake of the MMR vaccine. We do not have complete herd immunity from measles, mumps and rubella because our uptake rate is well below the recommended participation rates that would guarantee it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's approach to what is a very worrying issue for parents. With regard to the tragic deaths from meningitis in the last few days, will the Minister indicate if the children concerned were infected with meningitis C and will he also indicate if there is any plan to accelerate the campaign to vaccinate children against meningitis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that the message he is giving on the danger of measles in particular, and the importance of the MMR vaccine is continued and put across, especially to the parents of young children? Perhaps he will comment on the report by the Oireachtas committee, which looked carefully at this issue and came out very strongly in favour of the MMR vaccination programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who works in the front line in this area I am well aware of the importance of vaccinations and I am glad the Minister has issued such a strong statement on the use of the MMR vaccine. According to figures before me, the HIP and hepatitis C vaccination programmes are an outstanding success. The Minister will be aware of that. However, an element of doubt continues on the question of autism and there has been a massive increase in the number of cases. We should question if there is a role by susceptible children within the herd, to use the word employed in this context.</P>
      <P>The document to which the Minister referred has been very useful in general practice in convincing parents that MMR is a safe vaccine. I am glad he has issued such a strong statement and I hope the programme will accelerate because vaccination levels are dropping significantly.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that some of the studies, especially those by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and Professor John O'Leary, cannot be dismissed, despite the subsequent statement from Professor O'Leary? Does he also agree that the capacity to tell the truth on this issue is severely diminished by the likely compensation claims that would ensue should a link be proved?</P>
      <P>Given the unprecedented rise in autism, does the Minister agree that there are many factors involved, including environmental and genetic causes? Does he also agree it is time to have a national survey to show what is the likely cause of the huge increase in autism?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that the name Corcaigh derives from the word &ldquo;portach&rdquo; which is the Irish word for a bog or a marsh. Given the development of the city over the years, the inner city has been prone to flooding on a sporadic basis. However, measures taken by Cork City Council in recent years appear to have addressed the problems.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, like Dublin last week, Cork this week has experienced flooding that has caused devastation to householders and businesses. It is incumbent on the Minister of State to respond on behalf of the Government to indicate whether the support measures offered in relation to the residents of County Meath and those bordering the River Tolka in Dublin city are also to be offered to householders and businesses in the Cork city area.</P>
      <P>Like the Dublin flooding, the flooding that occurred in Cork was not on the main river, although some flooding occurred in the city centre in the usual locations just 20 feet from my constituency office. Most of the flooding occurred from the tributary rivers &ndash; the River Tramore on the south side and the River Bride on the north side. This caused a great deal of discomfort on the south side in Togher, Turner's Cross and Kinsale Road with much of the road network immobilised. Similar effects occurred on the north side in the historic part of Blackpool and flooding was caused from two other waterways in the suburban centres of Carrickalyon and Ballincollig.</P>
      <P>In the Estimates just presented to the House there was a &euro;5.5 million increase for flood relief measures. The Government must recognise that &euro;19 million is a very small figure and does not come close to the type of relief measures that need to be taken throughout the country to alleviate flood damage, prevent it from occurring and to offer confidence to residents and businesses who suffer its effects. In the Estimates, humanitarian aid for flood relief was reduced from &euro;8.5 million to &euro;59,000, which does not inspire people to believe that when they experience such difficulty, as happened in Cork city yesterday, that they will receive appropriate support from State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments, including this one, have not offered appropriate support for infrastructure which might alleviate flood damage, particularly in the city centre. Cork City Council, over a ten year period, has applied to have the city quay walls upgraded and reinforced but not a penny has come from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Government needs to recognise the flood risks in the Cork city area and now also in suburban Cork due to the Lee's tributaries also being exposed to flooding with the consequent damage to residences and businesses. I am hoping for a similar response to that which the Minister's colleague, <Col N="1620" /> Deputy Parlon, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, gave to residents in the wake of the River Tolka flooding. If the Government is to be consistent, it must apply equal standards in all parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I first of all express sympathy on my own behalf and that of the Government to everyone affected by the flooding in Cork city last evening which is a very traumatic experience. As the House will be aware this is the most recent of a number of serious flooding incidents throughout the country in the past two weeks or so.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Boyle stated, Cork city was built on a marsh and the central area has been vulnerable historically to high tides and rainfall, which combined can create flooding. Flooding occurred in Cork city during the night of 20 November and early morning of 21 November arising from heavy rainfall during the early hours of this morning. Rain was falling in the Cork area from early afternoon yesterday and intensified overnight and was heaviest between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. when up to 24 mm fell. Three areas affected included the Greenwood estate of Togher, the Millfield Cottages area of Blackpool and Blackpool village. Turner's Cross was also affected where, in the mid-1990s, significant investment was put in to improve the drainage capacity, but that must be reviewed.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the floodwaters that affected the Millfield Cottages area originated in the vicinity of Kilbarry industrial estate. The storm waters flowed along Whitechurch Road, into Redforge Road and into Millfield Cottages and Spring Lane. The floodwaters escaped from here to a culvert near Thomas Davis Street and entered the Bride River upstream of Blackpool Church. It is reported that the area was also affected by flows from the Glen River, but this cannot be verified at this point. Approximately 16 privately owned houses were affected. Obviously the local authority will be investigating further, including the adequacy of storm water storage capacity at the industrial estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flooding in Greenwood estate seems to have arisen from a stream which flows from the county boundary towards Palmbury estate. The stream enters a culvert at the south of Togher Road, just south of the Doughcloyne Hotel. This culvert carries the stream at the north of Togher Road to the Tramore River. The entry point of the stream to the culvert is protected by a trash grating barrier and it appears that this grating got partially blocked and was not able to accommodate the flow. As a result the floodwaters flowed onto the road and into the low point at Greenwood estate <Col N="1621" /> where a number of houses may have been affected.</P>
    <P>Flooding occurred in Blackpool village in the early hours of this morning. The River Bride, which flows in an open channel at the north of Blackpool church, enters and is carried in a masonry stone arched culvert along Watercourse Road. This culvert either got constricted by debris or did not have adequate capacity to carry the flow. Local authority staff had been called out earlier to this area to clear gullies and this was done. The flood waters rose at the culvert entry point, spilled onto the Watercourse Road near Blackpool church, flowed along the Watercourse Road, into Gerald Griffin Street and Gerald Griffin Avenue. A number of business premises, private houses and cars were flooded along with Blackpool church.</P>
    <P>The existing culvert at this point has a capacity of 12.6 cubic metres per second. I am glad to report that as part of the Cork main drainage scheme, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has just approved the contract documents to replace this culvert, which should improve the situation here. The new culvert will have almost three times the capacity of the existing one. The local authority is now free to go to tender for this job. Other issues raised by the Deputy, particularly in terms of supporting people affected, will be brought to the attention of Deputy Parlon, the Minister of State with responsibility in this area.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate on Beaumont Hospital which is located in the heart of my constituency, Dublin North Central. It is appropriate that we are discussing this serious issue in the week of the publication of the Book of Estimates. I was elected on a strong health and disability platform and I intend to develop this agenda further and push it strongly. It is a national scandal that after seven years of an economic boom and a lot of hot air from the Government parties Beaumont Hospital still has roofs and windows leaking, a shortage of beds, cancer operations cancelled, inadequate intensive care services, no proper facilities for doctors, one toilet for 40 male doctors and 24 more beds needed for seriously ill patients.</P>
      <P>I compliment Dr. David Hickey, director of the kidney and pancreas transplant unit, for his honest, open and genuine views on the conditions in the hospital. We need people of his ability, integrity and calibre working in our health services. He cares passionately about the quality of the health service and has the vision to take the broader view of society and to be concerned about the Third World. He is a radical caring and progressive person, both at home and abroad. We need voices like his to put down a marker to people who appear to think they are running a business rather than a country, society or hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" />As I said before about Beaumont, despite the major flaws, I am particularly proud of the staff and the excellent professional job done for their patients. Over the last seven years, we had the opportunity with all our extra finances and resources to do something sensible and radical about Beaumont and other hospitals, such as Temple Street Children's Hospital. Despite all the hype and the so-called 6% increase in health spending, which is a joke given health inflation is running at 10%, in Beaumont there was only one doctor to see the 6,000 diabetics who attended the hospital last year. Is this Government living in the real world? We are supposed to have 24 beds for transplant patients but have only six which is a disaster and disgrace. Many people working at the coalface are now concerned that there will be an exodus of doctors and nurses from the public health system, which is a nightmare situation and a major crisis waiting to happen unless we act now.</P>
    <P>The Minister's defence of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, during the debate on the Estimates shows the direction in which the Government is going and it does not look good for Beaumont and the rest of the health services. I agree that tough decisions must be made, but why do we distort that word, so that it means closing beds and hammering the sick? The real tough decision would be to go after the tax dodgers and the &euro;987 million in uncollected taxes instead of cutting health services. He must take the tough decisions in the patients' interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also listen carefully to the views of the technical group, which the Minister of State would have heard earlier with the intervention of Deputy Twomey. We have quality people in the technical group with a medical background who can give good advice on running of a proper health service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate on Beaumont and urge the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure Beaumont gets the maximum resources and finance to provide a top quality health service for the people of the north side of Dublin and the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I would like to deal with the issue raised by Deputy McGrath on the Adjournment and refute the suggestion made in the course of his address that the benefits and the moneys which accrued to the Government in the past seven years have been squandered in terms of improvements in the health service. I appreciate that Deputy McGrath was elected to this House for the first time in the recent general election but if he peruses the Appropriations Acts and the allocations under different Estimates in the past seven years he will see there was an enormous increase in the volume of expenditure on the health service in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" />I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to Beaumont Hospital and to refute the implication that there has been any neglect of the hospital by the Government in terms of its development or refurbishment. I refer the House to a letter in <i>The Irish Times </i>yesterday from the hospital's chief executive in which he detailed a comprehensive investment programme at Beaumont Hospital. It is evident, however, that the views attributed to the hospital consultant in question are personal and do not reflect the views of the hospital's board and management.</P>
    <P>In February 2000 the Department of Health and Children approved major equipment replacement and refurbishing works at Beaumont Hospital. As the Deputy will appreciate, major works such as these must, of necessity, be introduced on a phased basis to minimise disruption to patient services. The replacement equipment programme, costing approximately &euro;11 million, is almost completed. The equipment replacement programme covers, <i>inter alia,</i> theatres, laboratories, out-patients and general wards. The Department, the hospital and the Eastern Regional Health Authority are finalising proposals for the refurbishment phase of the project. This work is being progressed as a priority.</P>
    <P>In terms of acute hospital bed capacity, the Deputy will be aware that the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. The Minister, Deputy Martin, announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. The latest advice to the Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards indicates that in excess of 600 beds will be in place by the end of this year and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year. The increase in bed capacity will allow the hospital system to make a significant increase in the activity levels for public patients. An additional 35 beds are being provided at Beaumont Hospital under this initiative.</P>
    <P>The Department is informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that these beds will be commissioned early in 2003. The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services. The underlying principle is to ensure that care is delivered in the most appropriate setting. Strategies are being developed in the areas of primary and community care, services for older persons and physical and sensory disability services to increase the capacity of such services to provide the necessary care in the appropriate setting.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that funding has been provided in recent years for the contracting of additional places in private nursing homes to help reduce the effect of inappropriately placed patients on the acute hospital system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" />I am pleased to advise the Deputy that an additional &euro;1 million has recently been provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to cover the cost of providing additional contract beds in the current year. This additional funding will further assist in alleviating the pressure of inappropriate bed occupancy in the acute hospitals over the winter months. I understand Beaumont will have access to an additional ten places under this initiative.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to clarify the position in relation to service provision at Beaumont Hospital. I am confident that the measures taken, including the capital investment, by my Department, the authority and the hospital concerned will provide a greatly enhanced environment and service at Beaumont Hospital for patients, staff and visitors.</P>

      <P>It is with deep concern that I raise on the Adjournment the threatened all-out strike of SIPTU members in the Clare health services arising from the suspension of three receptionists who were assigned to duties in Ennis General Hospital following the closure of Our Lady's psychiatric hospital, Ennis.</P>
      <P>The dispute stems from the fact that the three receptionists who were transferred within the psychiatric service to Ennis General Hospital were unhappy with their working conditions. The staff were employed as Grade III clerical workers. The health board stated that the receptionists were assigned to a centralised reception area of Ennis General Hospital with the full agreement of their union and as was the case with every other worker transferred from Our Lady's hospital, they received &euro;3,500 in compensation. The dispute commenced at that point.</P>
      <P>Since 28 May last, the three receptionists have been off duty without pay and while efforts were made by both sides to settle the ongoing dispute, there have been no face to face meetings. Yesterday afternoon, the Mid-Western Health Board confirmed that the Grade III clerical workers at the centre of the long running dispute in Clare mental health services have been suspended without pay.</P>
      <P>This is a serious situation that has now arisen as SIPTU has now called for an all-out strike in the Clare health services arising from the suspension. This could have immediate consequences for all the health services within the county. The dispute will have to be settled one way or another and every attempt will have to be made to find a formula whereby these receptionists can return to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister of State realise the extent of the disruption that will ensue if an all-out strike takes place? Services at Ennis General Hospital will be affected, and I am aware the Minister of State has a strong connection to County Clare <Col N="1625" /> and that he will do everything possible to ensure that the &euro;13 million to &euro;15 million extension and improvement works to be carried out at Ennis General Hospital will not be affected by the cutbacks in the Estimates. As the Minister of State is aware, County Clare has a population of over 100,000. The project is at design stage and I hope the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Martin, will make every effort to ensure that planning permission for the work is proceeded with in 2003.</P>
    <P>Other services that will be affected will be acute and long stay psychiatric services, services for the elderly, who are very vulnerable, and the ambulance service.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that consolidation talks chaired by the industrial relations officer of the Labour Court took place last Thursday and that following these talks, the matter was referred to the Labour Court for a full hearing? Is he aware also that with the Labour Court proceedings pending, the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board took the unilateral action of suspending the clerical officers involved without pay? I regret that and I call on the Minister for Health and Children to intervene at this stage and, if necessary, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should use her powers under the industrial relations Act to intervene. I tried to raise the matter this morning on the Order of Business under Standing Order 31 but unfortunately the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order.</P>
    <P>As a public representative for County Clare, I hope that face to face talks can now take place between the union and the health board. If I can facilitate the process in any way I would be delighted to do so because we do not want disruption of the health services in the winter period. Our services are basic enough without that happening. I ask the Minister of State to see what he can do to settle this serious dispute.</P>

      <P>Deputy Breen has raised the need for the Minister for Health and Children and, if possible, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to intervene to prevent an all-out strike of SIPTU members in the Clare health services arising from a suspension without pay of three receptionists who were transferred from Our Lady's Hospital to Ennis General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The management of employee relations, including assignments and relocations within each health board, are in the first instance a matter for the chief executive officer of that board.</P>
      <P>I understand the problems that have arisen in the matter referred to by Deputy Pat Breen and I am aware that the board was, and remains, anxious to resolve these difficulties. In view of my potential role in the event of an appeal by one or more of the parties in this issue, it is inappropriate for me to comment further on the detail of this issue and processes utilised in an effort to resolve the ongoing difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Drogheda northern port access cross route will cost &euro;28.6 million. It is an essential road for the expansion of the town of Drogheda and a critical issue for the local authority. Its length is 5.5 kms and it will take all of the traffic from the motorway across to the port. Drogheda is clogged with traffic. Heavy trucks travel to and from the port through the streets of the town, which is a matter of concern to all the citizens.</P>
      <P>In a report to the county council last Monday the Louth county manager said work on the project had been suspended indefinitely and would not be resumed until £1 million expended by the council had been recouped. No commitment has been made by the Drogheda Port Company to contribute to the cost or by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which was to be approached by the port company.</P>
      <P>As the project does not concern a national road, the NRA has no involvement. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, which is aware of the project, will not be approached until funding is committed and paid by the port company and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The road must be paid for by the following parties: Drogheda Corporation, Drogheda Borough Council, Drogheda Port Company, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and those with planning permission to develop the town on the northern environs in which 15,000 new dwellings will be built.</P>
      <P>The road is essential to contribute to the proper and orderly development of Drogheda. Unless it is built the town will not develop in a manner acceptable to the people who live there. The development plan for the northern side of the town is under consideration. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is my constituency colleague. He must use his power and influence within his Department which has a very important role to play. The future of Drogheda relies on his Department's contribution. Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have placed the road at the core of the development plan and £1 million has already been spent. It is up to the Minister to do his bit for the town.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1627" />Before turning to the specific issue raised in relation to Louth County Council, I wish to avail of this opportunity to outline the progress being made in relation to the significant resourcing of non-national roads. On 18 January this year a record provision for non-national roads of &euro;438.46 million was announced for 2002. This represents an increase of 9.4% on the 2001 outturn and a doubling of the original 1997 allocation of over &euro;219 million. In making this provision the Government was again delivering, as it had in previous years, on its commitment to ensure an adequate financial base for the non-national roads programme. This has been copperfastened by the national development plan, which commits expenditure of &euro;2.43 billion in the period to 2006, channelled through the regional operational programmes of the BMW and southern and eastern regional assemblies. What this means is that there will be significant expenditure on non-national roads in each of the years covered by the NDP. Under the plan, State grant expenditure in the period 2000-02 was profiled at &euro;1.04 billion. We have exceeded this profile, spending &euro;1.184 billion in the period. We will continue to invest in non-national roads over the lifetime of the plan.</P>
    <P>All local authorities have benefited equally from this increased investment. Louth County <Col N="1628" /> Council's 2002 allocation of &euro;6,124,575 represents an increase of 115% on the 1997 outturn of &euro;2,846,753 and a 20% increase on the 2001 payment figure of &euro;5,067,876. In addition, the council has indicated that it intends to invest over &euro;2 million from its own resources on non-national roads in 2002. This, in effect, means that it should have over &euro;8.1 million available to it in 2002 for non-national roads.</P>
    <P>The council recently submitted six proposals to the Department for funding totalling &euro;2.525 million in 2003 under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme. These proposals include an application for funding of &euro;150,000 for the Drogheda port access road, otherwise known as the Ballymakenny cross route. This application, together with all other applications under the scheme, are being assessed in my Department, having regard to compliance with eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available for the scheme in 2003. It is intended to announce the 2003 non-national road grant allocations, including allocations under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme, early in 2003. All applications will be considered by the Department in coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 26 November 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of steps has been taken to date in the implementation of the primary care strategy, &ldquo;Primary Care: A New Direction&rdquo;. In the first place, I established the primary care task force in April 2002. It has responsibility for driving the implementation of the changes and developments set out in the model. To begin the process of implementation of the new primary care model, the primary care task force prioritised the selection of locations for a number of initial primary care implementation projects.</P>
      <P>In October 2002 I gave approval to the first ten such projects. These projects will involve putting in place in ten locations around the country a primary care team which will include general practitioners, nurses, midwives, health care assistants, home helps, an occupational therapist, physiotherapist, a social worker and administrative personnel. The projects will build on the services and resources already in place in the ten locations involved so as to develop over the coming months a primary care team in line with the interdisciplinary model described in the strategy. These teams will include general practitioners, nurses, midwives, health care assistants, home helps, an occupational therapist, physiotherapist, a social worker and management &ndash; administrative personnel. The areas where the ten implementation projects will be located are Virginia, County Cavan; Lifford, County Donegal; Ballymun, Dublin; south inner city, Dublin; Dingle Peninsula, County Kerry; Portarlington, County Laois; west County Limerick; Erris Peninsula, County Mayo; Cashel, County Tipperary, and Arklow, County Wicklow. I have provided funding totalling &euro;8.4 million for this purpose in 2002 and 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary care task force will work with the health boards and other interests to support the implementation projects in achieving the goal of putting a primary care team in place in each of the locations identified. I established a national primary care steering group in June 2002. It is chaired by Professor Ivan Perry, professor of epidemiology and public health at University College, Cork. The group will give national leadership and guidance in relation to several key elements of the implementation plan. Furthermore, a number of sub-groups have been estab<Col N="1630" /> lished to give detailed consideration to particular aspects of the implementation agenda and to make recommendations which can then be translated into action by the appropriate bodies and agencies. At regional level the health boards are also putting representative structures in place.</P>
    <P>The preparation of needs assessments is also being progressed by the health boards. At the request of the primary care task force, the health board chief executive officers have established a national group to co-ordinate this process. The group will agree definitions, standards and the process for the completion of the needs assessments in line with the commitment contained in the primary care strategy. The work of this group is proceeding, with macro-level assessments being carried out initially, to be followed by the development of models that can be used at micro-level for primary care team and network populations.</P>
    <P>A national conference on the primary care strategy was held in Galway on 23 and 24 October. This was the first conference organised at a national level to discuss, in partnership with the key stakeholders and organisations, the implementation of the strategy. The conference facilitated the exchange of views and perspectives on the main themes and issues which will need to be addressed as the implementation process moves forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The decision to discharge a patient from hospital is a matter for the patient's consultant, based on clinical judgment and assessment of the patient's condition. One of the factors which was identified by the review of acute hospital bed capacity as contributing to pressure on the acute hospital system was the inability to discharge patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment, but who require further care in a more appropriate setting, such as long-term care, rehabilitation, hospice care, convalescence, etc. A number of initiatives are under way to address the capacity problems affecting the acute hospital system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the health strategy, the Government decided to provide an additional <Col N="1631" /> 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. Earlier this year I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals. Some 272 of these beds have been commissioned under this initiative to date. The latest advice to my Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards indicates that in excess of 600 beds will be in place by year end and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year. The increase in bed capacity will allow the hospital system to significantly increase activity levels for public patients.</P>
    <P>Under the winter initiative funding has been provided for contracting of additional places in private nursing homes to help reduce the effect of inappropriately placed patients on the acute hospital system; recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants and consultant anaesthetists and the provision of a range of supports including walking aids, wheelchairs and special beds.</P>
    <P>My Department has plans for a pilot project under the public private partnership initiative in the health sector to provide long stay accommodation for older people in community nursing units, CNUs. The services offered in these units will include assessment/rehabilitation, respite, extended care, elderly mentally infirm and convalescence. Day centres for the elderly will be combined with the community nursing units in each site to help promote the dignity and independence of older people and to support them in living at home. It is anticipated that 17 new community nursing units will be created when the PPP initial plot programme is complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds. The provision of the additional beds to be provided under the pilot PPP programme will free up acute hospital beds where older people may be inappropriately placed and provide a higher quality of care for those people who require the various services provided by community nursing units.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the health strategy, strategies are being developed in the areas of primary and community care, services for older people and physical and sensory disability services to increase the capacity of such services to provide the necessary care in the appropriate setting. The range of measures described above will help to alleviate the pressures being experienced by the acute hospital system in terms of capacity. I will continue to work towards increasing capacity to ensure that the ever increasing demand for services can be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that EC Council Directive 92/49/EEC completed the internal market in direct non-life insurance as regards right of establishment and freedom to provide services. Expressly, in the area of health insurance, the directive allowed for member states to operate specific legal provisions to protect the general good. In Ireland, the directive gave rise to the passing of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, with the objective of maintaining the core principles of community rating, open enrolment, and lifetime cover in our established health insurance arrangements. Under the Act, provision was made for the implementation of risk equalisation between insurers in order to sustain, across the entire insured population, the solidarity between the old and ill and the young and healthy, which is at the heart of effective community rating. In that connection, EC Council Directive 92/49/EEC refers to the specific legal provisions being able to include requiring insurers to participate in &ldquo;loss compensation schemes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My Department has had extensive contacts with European Commission services on the regulation of community rated health insurance in Ireland under the Single Market. The approach adopted has at all times been one of full constructive engagement and willing co-operation with the EU in the process of developing the common good regulatory framework for our health insurance system. This close liaison resulted in the EU's internal market directorate determining that Ireland was entitled, in principle, to have specific legal provisions protecting the common good, including risk equalisation, in the area of voluntary health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the specific question of State aid, the EU's competition directorate carried out a thorough examination of the Irish market in 1998-99 arising from an objection made to it by the British United Provident Association, BUPA. The outcome of this process, as advised to my Department by the directorate, was that it did not have any particular State aid concerns about risk equalisation. A copy of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which provided for revised risk equalisation arrangements was for<Col N="1633" /> warded to the directorate for information and did not give rise to any further queries from it. This was subsequently enacted by the Oireachtas in June 2001. Therefore, my Department has proceeded on the basis of the finding made by the directorate that risk equalisation does not give rise to State aid concerns.</P>
    <P>More recently, arising from further approaches by BUPA, the directorate has indicated that it is again considering the matter of risk equalisation by reference to State aid rules. I understand its considerations in this matter are ongoing. It has not informed my Department that a risk equalisation scheme in the private health insurance market is an unlawful State aid. I trust the directorate will adhere to the determination it previously made on foot of its detailed examination of risk equalisation, especially as, in the interim, the proposed arrangements have been modified to further reflect the fundamental principles of necessity and proportionality under EU law. I remain satisfied that risk equalisation is a necessary support to the operation of community rating going forward.</P>

      <P>The latest information provided to my Department by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board indicates that drug costs for the GMS are expected to increase by 29% this year. Ingredient costs and prescription costs are each running at approximately 15% higher than last year. A number of factors can contribute in any year to the rising cost of drugs for the GMS. These factors include an increase in the number of medical card holders and an increase in both the cost and volume of drugs and medicines available for prescribing. The number of people with a medical card has increased from 1,199,454 at 31 December 2001 to 1,200,162 at 1 August 2002. The year 2002 is the first full year in which persons over the age of 70 years are automatically entitled to a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of drugs and medicines, ex manufacture, in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA &ndash; formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, FICI. Under these agreements, the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the <Col N="1634" /> prices charged for existing products. The current agreement has been extended to mid-2005.</P>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme on 1 July 1999. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified. Many of these new drug treatments are more expensive than existing treatments and are patent protected so that generic substitution is not possible. The total number of items prescribed under the general medical services scheme in 2001 was 25,656,314, of which 5,363,002 or 20.9% were generics.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1993 general practitioners have been allocated an annual target budget for expenditure on drugs for their GMS patients under the indicative drug target saving scheme. Targets are determined by national norms and form part of an agreement between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation. In an attempt to limit the escalation of the annual costs of GMS drugs, general practitioners participating in the scheme are permitted to accrue savings under this scheme which can then be used to fund general practice developments at their practice premises for the benefit of their patients. Applications for funds from this scheme must be formally approved by the local health board in advance of payment by the GMS (Payments) Board.</P>
    <P>A review of the scheme undertaken by Professor Michael Murphy, which was published in July 1997, found that there were changes in prescribing behaviour as a result of the scheme. Some doctors made savings through enhanced prescribing of generic medications and there were no discernible negative effects on the overall quality of prescribing.</P>
    <P>I inform the Deputy that the Department has placed a contract with Deloitte &amp; Touche to conduct a consultancy review of the governance and accountability in the general medical services schemes. The terms of reference for the proposed review are: to analyse the governance and accountability mechanisms in the general medical services schemes and payments made by the GMS (Payments) Board on behalf of health boards; to examine the roles and responsibilities of the Department of Health and Children, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, health boards and the GMS (Payments) Board in this context; to examine the underlying reasons for increasing cost trends in the general medical services schemes; to validate the latest estimated outturn for 2002 and assess its implications going forward and to make recommendations for the immediate resolution of any identified weaknesses and inadequacies. An interim report has been received from Deloitte &amp; Touche outlining its findings in relation to the validation of the estimated outturn for 2002. A full report is expected shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance. Entitlement to secondary care orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. It is widely recognised that decisions made in the private sector regarding orthodontic treatment are based primarily on subjective need and are not based on any evidence linking the orthodontic condition to any aspect of dental ill health. On the other hand, decisions made in health boards are based on prioritised guidelines ensuring that cases are selected for treatment based on the objective severity of the condition.</P>
      <P>I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service. Ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Four of these dentists are for the authority and additional funding of &euro;405,000 was provided to the authority in 2002 for this programme. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. The <Col N="1636" /> training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit, thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year, of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Under the initiative, the ERHA was allocated &euro;2.044 million. This enabled the authority to recruit additional staff, including two consultant orthodontists and to develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital. My Department has also funded a six chair orthodontic suite for the Northern Area Health Board, which is expected to be operational in spring 2003. The authority is also validating its orthodontic waiting lists as part of this initiative.</P>
    <P>Last June my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and to purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The ERHA received &euro;1.815 million from the fund for the treatment of cases in this way. The regional chief executive has informed me that at the end of September 2002 there were 2,990 cases in orthodontic treatment in the authority's area. I am confident the measures I have outlined will further improve the provision of orthodontic services in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the joint request to the European Commission from the European Parliament and European Council to consolidate and simplify the directives dealing with the recognition of professional qualifications in order to facilitate the freedom of movement of professionals within the Union. The European Commission launched its proposal for a consolidated directive in March of this year. As the proposal deals with the recognition of qualifications across a wide range of professions, the Department of Education and Science is the lead Department in these negotiations and the Government is represented by the Tánaiste at Council level regarding the matter.</P>
      <P>Since the launch of the Commission's proposal, officials of my Department have been in close contact with the regulatory bodies in the health sector on this directive. My Department has raised a number of concerns regarding the proposal, both through the Department of Education and Science and directly with the Commission. The Deputies should be aware that other member states have expressed concerns similar to ours. My officials arranged a bilateral meeting with the Commission, at which the Medical Council was represented, to discuss concerns regarding the regulation of health professionals and the implications of the Commission's proposed directive on such regulation. My Department was also represented at the European Parliament's hearing on the proposal.</P>
      <P>The main concern regarding the proposal is that the proposed directive does not make any reference to consumer protection. As the Deputies will be aware, the health and safety of patients and their protection in dealings with the health professions is the primary aim of the regulation of the health professions in Ireland. The Deputies may rest assured that, in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and the office of the Tánaiste, I will continue to closely monitor progress with regard to the proposed directive and will continue to ensure that patient safety and quality of standards are given due consideration in the drafting of the directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I met representatives of Parents for Justice on 16 October last to hear their concerns about the post-mortem inquiry. While it was acknowledged <Col N="1638" /> that the inquiry has dealt sensitively and thoroughly with parents and next of kin who have been called for interview, it was clear that the length of time it is taking for the inquiry to carry out its work is a major issue for Parents for Justice. I told the representatives of Parents for Justice that I share their concerns about the timeframe for the inquiry. When the Government decided to set up a non-statutory inquiry into post-mortem practices, it did so in good faith believing it was the best option and that the task could be completed within 18 months, which time expired last September. When I met the chairman in early September, she informed me that the inquiry still had a substantial amount of work to undertake and she was not in a position to say when her report would be available.</P>
      <P>During the meeting with Parents for Justice, I indicated that it would be unfair to them and to other parties concerned if the process was allowed to drag on indefinitely. However, I added that the notion that a changeover from a non-statutory to a statutory inquiry would overcome the timeframe problem is misguided. I indicated my belief that the only way in which the timescale can be shortened is to give the inquiry a much sharper focus in consultation with Parents for Justice and other relevant parties.</P>
      <P>The other major issue of concern raised by Parents for Justice related to the statutory phase of the investigation. I assured the group that it has been and remains my intention that the investigation into post-mortem practice and organ retention issues will have a statutory phase. If it transpires that it is not possible to do so through an Oireachtas Committee, whether as a result of the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case or otherwise, I am committed to ensuring that it is done through another appropriate forum with statutory powers.</P>
      <P>Despite my assurances to Parents for Justice that I was committed to the process, the group decided to withdraw from the inquiry process. I regret that and I have made it clear to the group that my door remains open for further discussions as I believe we can work together in partnership to resolve the present problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is carried out by the South Eastern Health Board in relation to community child health services within its functional area. The review compares the existing services with the model child health service set out in the &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo; report, identifies areas of divergence in practice against the proposed <Col N="1639" /> model, reports on gaps in service provision and makes recommendations for moving towards the model of practice recommended by &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the 1970 Health Act, the statutory responsibility for the provision of child health services for pre-school children and those in national schools rests with the health boards. The question of the prioritisation of services and the allocation of resources to meet service demands within the context of its budgetary provision is a matter for each health board.</P>
      <P>Child health services were the subject of an examination by the chief executive officers of the health boards and the outcome of that review was the report, &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo;, which was launched in 1999. This report recommends a model child health surveillance programme aimed at ensuring that all children have an opportunity to realise their full potential in terms of good health, well-being and development and that remediable disorders are identified and acted upon as early as possible. The co-ordinated approach to protect and promote children's health in partnership with parents and health professionals recommended in &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo; has been fully endorsed in the recent health strategy.</P>
      <P>In the context of facilitating the implementation of the recommendations of &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo;, my Department has allocated additional funding in the region of &euro;2 million to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2001 and 2002. The South Eastern Health Board has received &euro;250,000 to assist it in implementing the recommendations. The additional funding provided to boards has been used to establish key posts, for example, that of child health development officer to assist in driving the implementation process at regional level and also to commence projects demonstrating best practice in particular areas of child health. These projects range from a model school health service in the North Western Health Board to a parent-held child health record system in the Mid-Western Health Board. In the case of the South Eastern Health Board, the project is aimed at the development of appropriate information and materials to meet the health information needs of parents and carers of children from the ante-natal to pre-school stage. A special feature of the implementation of the recommendations of the &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo; report is that of conjoint working by all health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A national conjoint child health committee established by the chief executive officers of the boards and the authority is monitoring and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations and national child health co-ordinators are facilitating the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of community child health services in the South Eastern Health Board should be seen against the background of initiatives under <Col N="1640" /> way nationally aimed at improving child health services. Its publication is timely and provides a clear reference point for the board in planning for the development of services in its area. A vital element of the board's planning must necessarily involve consideration of the extent to which existing resources can be redeployed to ensure that deficiencies and gaps identified in the service are tackled and addressed. I understand the board has accepted the report as regional policy and that its regional child health committee has prioritised the recommendations in the report into short-term, medium-term and long-term targets. Furthermore, the board's regional child health development officer has been given the responsibility of working towards implementing the recommendations under the guidance and supervision of the regional child health steering committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies, such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these endorsements, I decided to establish the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was recently launched and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure, subject to the recommendations of the forum. The forum also concluded that water fluoridation has been effective in improving the oral health of the population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly. The best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drink<Col N="1641" /> ing water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected. Dental fluorosis, a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel, is a well recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research.</P>
    <P>The forum's report emerged from 14 plenary meetings, several meetings of sub-groups and oral presentations of material from both proponents and opponents of fluoridation. The forum invited the public to forward their views and examined more than 1,000 submissions. The forum took a participatory and evidence based approach striving to ensure balance between participants from both sides of the debate on water fluoridation. The report made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation.</P>
    <P>The forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and was circulated to each Member of this House. It has also been placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Following publication of the report, I asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum. This expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride going forward. In particular, ongoing research related to fluoride will continue to be evaluated by the expert body and expanded to deal with new emerging issues.</P>

      <P>While particular difficulties have been experienced in delivering services at local level to children attending the Developmental Education Centre at St. Vincent's Centre, Navan Road, I emphasise that there has been no reduction in the level of resources available from the health services to support the children. I have been assured by the management in St. Vincent's Centre that every effort is being made to fill the nursing vacancies in this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With my colleagues, the Minister for Education <Col N="1642" /> and Science, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Lenihan, I met representatives of the parents. Officials from my Department have been in contact with the management of the centre. Local management has been endeavouring to resolve the difficulties and this process is ongoing. It was agreed that the two Departments would nominate two people with relevant professional experience in this area to provide whatever assistance they can to local management in the matter. The two people nominated by the Departments met representatives of the families and other relevant parties. As part of the internal process to resolve the difficulties which have arisen in the services, a facilitator was appointed by local management and an internal working group established to work with the various professionals with a view to reaching a resolution in these matters. This process is nearing completion and I understand the facilitator's report is due shortly.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to all involved in the delivery of services to these children to ensure that the needs of the children are met by the most appropriate application of the health and educational resources available to the service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. BreastCheck is on target to complete phase one of the programme by December 2002. To end August 2002, 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 <Col N="1643" /> women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74%.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The board of BreastCheck recently submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme. My Department is in discussions with the executive of BreastCheck in relation to the expansion of the programme and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic services. I have invested substantially in the development of symptomatic breast services and further development is required.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck and a decision in relation to this issue will be considered in the context of the overall investment programme for cancer services for 2003. Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1997 more than &euro;103 million has been allocated to cancer services. Among other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts together with support staff. An additional sum of &euro;29 million is being allocated in 2003 for cancer services. This investment will ensure that next year we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology/haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, &euro;8.445 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to the SEHB specifically for the development of oncology and related services. This funding is inclusive of the 2002 allocation of &euro;2.3 million for the continuing development of oncology-haematology services, funding for new oncology drug treatments and the continuing development of symptomatic breast disease services. The funding mentioned has enabled a range of oncology developments under the national cancer strategy, including new consultant appointments in key areas in the SEHB, such as medical oncology, haematology and palliative care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provision of radiotherapy treatment, the work of the expert group on the development of radiotherapy services is at an advanced stage. The provision of additional ser<Col N="1644" /> vices for radiotherapy treatment will be considered in the context of the report of the expert group. I have been advised that all health boards, including the South Eastern Health Board, have been afforded the opportunity to meet with and make submissions to the group.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for a new national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003 is being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children and will set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.</P>

      <P>The advisory group examining the feasibility of introducing a no fault compensation scheme for brain damaged infants has met regularly since its establishment in July 2001. The group has conducted an extensive investigation of the clinical and legal issues involved in the handling of those cases. It has also examined existing levels of service provision for those affected by cerebral damage. The group has had a presentation made to it <Col N="1645" /> by parents of children affected by cerebral damage on the day to day implications of providing care for them at home. Most recently it has examined prevention strategies and the effect of reforms introduced in the United Kingdom on the handling of claims for compensation for injuries resulting from the provision of clinical care. My Department understands the group expects to be in a position to present its final report in the middle of 2003.</P>

      <P>Since 1996, more than &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of cancer services under the national cancer strategy. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the National Cancer Forum, in conjunction with my Department, is currently preparing a new national cancer strategy 2003 which will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. As part of this work, a sub-group of the National Cancer Forum has been established on generic screening. This sub-group is currently reviewing all issues relating to screening, including looking at specific diseases, such as prostate and colorectal cancer. The sub-group has consulted with the Construction Workers Health Trust in the process of this work and the group's recommendations will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy 2003.</P>

      <P>I recently met a delegation from the Diabetes Federation of Ireland to discuss the national development of diabetes services in Ireland. I intend to meet the federation again in early 2003 to discuss the matter further.</P>

    <P>In 2002 the health promotion unit of my Department allocated funding of &euro;50,000 for a diabetic nurse specialist post in the Diabetes Federation of Ireland. This post provides support for people with diabetes in the community, develops national awareness on diabetes, reviews literature and develops detailed direction for early detection and prevention of diabetes. The cardiovascu<Col N="1646" /> lar health strategy &ndash;&ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo;&ndash; which was launched by the Taoiseach in July 1999 addressed the common aspects of the prevention of all cardiovascular diseases, as well as the identification, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with heart disease. The following overall aims were identified: to reduce the risk factor profile in the general population; to detect those at high risk; to deal effectively with those who have clinical disease and ensure the best survival and quality of life outcome for those who recover from an acute attack. The strategy document contains 211 recommendations and structures are in place at national, regional and local level to support its systematic implementation. A total of &euro;45 million has been allocated to the implementation of the strategy in the first three years and a total of 800 new posts have been created with eight out of ten of these being professional staff.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman already investigates complaints of maladministration against the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. The issue of introducing an ombudsman for the health service was discussed during the health strategy consultation process. Having carefully considered the matter, the Government is satisfied that the existing Ombudsman is the appropriate person to deal with complaints relating to the health system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that one of the key guiding principles underpinning the national health strategy is the concept of peoplecentredness. The vision adopted for the health system of the future places a high value on treating people with dignity and respect. In pursuit of this objective, the strategy proposed the following actions: the extension of the role of the Ombudsman to voluntary hospitals and other voluntary agencies in the health areas; preparation of a Bill to amend the Ombudsman Act, 1980, to extend the remit of the Ombudsman to voluntary hospitals, currently being undertaken by my colleague the Minister for Finance &ndash; the question of extending that proposed Bill to encompass other voluntary agencies in the health sector is being examined at present; and the development of standardised customer services strategies by <Col N="1647" /> health boards to ensure a national standard and the implementation of standardised customer care plans by all service providers.</P>
    <P>My Department has commissioned an analysis of the 1,500 submissions received in the health strategy consultation process and expects to receive a report in February 2003. This report will feed into the development of national standards in this area. Health boards are committed to customer focused service delivery and a number of initiatives are taking place throughout the country in this regard, including customer care training, patient feedback mechanisms and the development of appropriate procedures for the handling of complaints and the development of a statutory framework for dealing with complaints.</P>
    <P>I have established a strategy legislation unit in my Department and preliminary work is under way on the preparation of legislative proposals in that regard. In addition, a project team established by the health boards's executive has produced draft guidelines for the handling of complaints and suggestions within the health service and for legislation for the investigation of complaints against individual professionals. The Government is committed to strengthening existing legislation regarding registration of certain professions such as doctors, nurses and pharmacists. New legislation will be introduced for the registration of health and social care professionals, including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, child care workers and others.</P>

      <P>The drug trial in question was held in a private hospital in which my Department has no function. The responsibility for clinical trials lies with the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
      <P>I understand the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, was informed on 2 September that patients recruited into three oncology trials conducted at St. Vincent's Private Hospital may have been charged over a period of months for two particular medicines used, despite signing a consent form which stated that these medicines would be supplied free of charge. This represented a violation of the clinical trial protocols for the three trials and a breach of Article 12 of the Control of Clinical Trials Act. Under the terms of the Act, the chief investigator has full responsibility for all aspects of the conduct of a clinical trial. The IMB has suspended the recruitment of new patients to all clinical trials being conducted at the hospital concerned. In the interests of patients who may be benefiting from participation in the clinical trials those already enrolled were allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>Officers of the IMB conducted a good clinical practice inspection of the oncology clinical trials carried out at the hospital concerned. The inspection encompassed all aspects of the conduct of clinical trials in accordance with the IMB's remit under the Control of Clinical Trials Act and international guidelines on good clinical practice. The IMB has sought clarification on a number of outstanding issues which were identified during this inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IMB's clinical trial sub-committee and board have rigorously reviewed each stage of the progress of this inspection and are keen to conclude this matter as soon as possible. The IMB has advised that the suspension of recruitment of new patients will remain in place until it is satisfied that appropriate systems and procedures are in place to ensure that the trials in question are being conducted in accordance with the legislation and with international guidelines on good <Col N="1649" /> clinical practice. I understand that the board of the hospital concerned engaged consultants to investigate the clinical trials conducted at the hospital with a particular focus on administrative and billing issues. I am satisfied that the matter is being appropriately dealt with and I do not propose initiating a separate investigation at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The health strategy sets out a comprehensive set of actions to reduce waiting times for public patients. The target is that by the end of 2004 all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department. Intermediate targets have been set to achieve this aim to ensure that the focus is being turned towards the long waiters.</P>
      <P>Full year information in respect of 2002 will not be available until early 2003. Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for public patients. The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for treatment in the target surgical specialties has fallen by 22% in the period June 2001 to June 2002. For example, there has been a reduction of 28% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology procedures and a fall of 20% in the number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for orthopaedic procedures in the same period. This period has also shown reductions in the number of children waiting more than six months for ENT procedures, which has fallen by 28%, and those waiting more than six months for ophthalmology procedures has been reduced by 24%. Further significant reductions in waiting times are expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of &euro;43.8 million has been made available to health agencies in 2002 under the waiting list initiative to support waiting list procedures. While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, a new dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used <Col N="1650" /> to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. In the current year, the national treatment purchase fund expects to treat up to 2,000 patients and from January 2003, it expects to refer 600 patients per month for treatment. To date, approximately 8,300 patients have been identified by hospitals and health boards as eligible for treatment under this initiative and approximately 1,000 patients have been treated.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the health strategy, has focused primarily on the need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long term. This year I have made provision for the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 272 of these beds have been commissioned under this initiative to date. The latest advice to my Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards indicates that in excess of 600 beds will be in place by year end and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The motorised transport grant was introduced in 1968 by way of Department of Health Circular 7/68. The guidelines were reviewed and modified in letters of 19 February 1974, 15 March 1974 and 15 January 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motorised transport grant is a grant which may be paid by the health boards towards the purchase of a car and/or adaptations to a car being purchased by a person with a severe disability who is 17 years or older and up to 65 years of age, where such a car is essential for him or her to obtain or retain employment. Self-employed persons who satisfy the criteria of eligibility may also be considered, subject to above age limits. In cases, where an application is made on the basis of obtaining or retaining employment or self-employment, the board must be satisfied that the applicant is capable of holding down a job, has the physical capacity to drive the vehicle <Col N="1651" /> and is qualified to hold a driver's licence, whether full or provisional. However, a qualified person with a disability who is incapable of driving or who has been medically advised not to drive and who has to be driven to and from his or her place of employment will only be considered eligible for a grant provided that he or she will be driven by another named person to and from his or her place of employment. The car must be purchased in the name of the person with a disability.</P>
    <P>Following a request by my Department, a national health board working group was established towards the end of 1999. One of the main objectives of this group was to examine all the various disability related allowances-grants which come under the remit of my Department, including the motorised transport grant. The group submitted its recommendations in August 2002. The group has recommended the extension of the scheme to those in third level education. My Department is currently examining the group's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency on 2 October 2001 under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961. The task of the agency, as a planning and co-ordinating body rather than as a provider of services, is to draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and to oversee its implementation, in consultation with Government and other non-statutory agencies. However, as the agency was not fully operational until 2002, its first annual report will not be produced until early in 2003. It is envisaged that the annual report will cover the period October 2001 to December 2002.</P>
      <P>The prevention of crisis pregnancy in the first instance is a primary task of the agency. Preventative issues concerning the education of young adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles, will be addressed. The agency will work to develop strategies to make women more aware of their options, should they have a crisis pregnancy, and to improve the supports and assistance available to women in this situation so that they will feel they have genuine alternatives to abortion. Women who have had an abortion, either recently or some time ago, have particular needs also and this is another area which the agency has been asked to address so that women are treated with compassion and understanding and that both their emotional and physical health needs are attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first priority of the agency was the recruitment of key staff. Initially, I appointed Ms Olive Braiden as chairperson on 3 October 2001. I am advised by the agency that a director and two senior managers, administration and programmes and communications, were recruited in June 2002. A research officer, as well as administrative staff, are also in place. A health promotion and education officer has also been recruited. Furthermore, the statutory instrument under which the agency was created provides for the establishment of a 20 person consultative committee which will have the function of providing expert advice for the board of the agency. Those organisations with an interest in the work of the agency will have a forum to present and share their views. The members of the committee have been <Col N="1653" /> appointed from various statutory and non-statutory organisations under the chair of Dr. Linda Hogan. It is expected that the first meeting of the committee will be convened shortly.</P>
    <P>As regards the development of a strategy to address crisis pregnancy in Ireland, the agency advises that as a first step in this process submissions were invited from members of the public and approximately 250 have been received. They are currently being examined, coded and analysed. A wide-ranging consultation process is also taking place which will inform the development of a strategy to address crisis pregnancy in Ireland and it is expected that this process will run into 2003. In addition, it is hoped to incorporate an action plan for the coming years in the strategy. This will provide the agency with a framework to implement its strategy in a planned and structured manner.</P>
    <P>In June of this year the agency invited funding proposals from key service providers. The merit of each proposal has been assessed and the agency has stated that up to &euro;900,000 will be provided in 2002 to carry out innovative work in the areas of information provision and capacity building. This funding will have knock-on costs of &euro;1.5 million for 2003. The main public information programme being developed by the agency in 2002 is Development of Information on Supports in Crisis Pregnancy. The agency expects to be in a position to begin the roll-out of this project from November 2002. The development of a research programme has also commenced. The agency has stated that the main priorities for this area include the development of an initial framework, an audit of existing research and an analysis of research gaps. The agency has advised that the following major developments also commenced in 2002: the commissioning of key research on crisis pregnancy counselling; the development of a communications framework and an audit of services provided nationally.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is intended to play a major role in the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services. The Government hopes that over time it will be possible to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among women and ensure that women who find themselves in this situation will have available to them the widest possible range of assistance to help them deal with their situation.</P>

      <P>I would like to clarify for the House that my Department did not issue a statement along the lines suggested by the Deputy. In common with all Departments, my Department produces an annual business plan. The plan for the acute hospitals division, which has responsibility for cancer services, drew attention to the heavy demands placed on it in supporting me to discharge my parliamentary duties. Given our system of public accountability, this work must and does receive priority.</P>
      <P>The relevant staff in my Department are also heavily involved as members or in support of the national cancer forum. The forum, in conjunction with my Department, is preparing a new national cancer strategy. The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert review group on radiotherapy services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the strategy is well advanced and is being supported by additional and dedicated research expertise. A consultation process began in June 2002 involving meetings between the chairman of the forum, my Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and all health boards. The forum has written to over <Col N="1655" /> 80 professional bodies, voluntary bodies and other stakeholders to obtain their views on cancer services. In addition, members of the public are being given the opportunity to make submissions through advertisements placed in the media. The forum has also engaged independent consultants to evaluate the extent to which the objectives of the national cancer strategy 1996 have been met. I also acknowledge the considerable time and commitment the chairman and other members of the forum have devoted to this important initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional funding was provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential and around 2,100 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In April 2000 infor<Col N="1656" /> mation from the national intellectual disability database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,711 new residential places were required to meet the identified needs for these services. My Department is reviewing on an ongoing basis the position in relation to the implementation of this development programme with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Information from the national intellectual disability database in relation to the level of service provision and identified need as of 30 May 2001 is currently being finalised. The initial indications from the 2001 data are that, while the impact of the 2000 development programme is reflected in the data, there is still a significant number of persons seeking residential services in particular. Further information in respect of service provision and identified need as of 30 May 2002 will be available early in 2003.</P>
      <P>Demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services, although the numbers of people receiving full-time residential services continue to increase. A baby boom in the 1960s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late twenties and early thirties requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously and are using services for several more years than previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
      <P>A review of the waiting lists between 1997 and 1999, conducted by the Health Research Board and published in the 1999 annual report from the national intellectual disability database, showed that while 269 people from the original waiting list of 1,439 received full-time residential services in the period, the waiting list had grown by an additional 238 places, that is, 507 had joined the waiting list in the period.</P>
      <P>The national monitoring committee, which is representative of my Department, the Health Research Board, the chief executives of the health boards, the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, NAMHI, is also involved in the monitoring of this programme. I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to fulfilling the commitment which it gave in relation to meeting the needs of this population group, as outlined in the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>My Department collects information on bed clos<Col N="1657" /> ures in acute hospitals from the health agencies on a quarterly basis. The most recent complete figures available to my Department relate to the first six months of 2002. This data shows that an estimated 2,796 bed days were lost due to isolation measures and infection control measures as a result of the winter vomiting virus. This figure represents approximately 0.1% of the overall bed days available for the first six months of the year.</P>
      <P>The small round structured virus, SRSV, more commonly known as the winter vomiting bug, is a form of viral gastroenteritis. It is highly infectious and can spread from person to person. Hence it is difficult to contain and it is spread extremely quickly, especially in institutions. Where outbreaks have occurred, hospitals have put full infection control measures in place in line with best practice guidelines. In an effort to prevent further outbreaks, health boards are appealing to members of the public who have any symptoms of vomiting or diarrhoea not to visit hospitals or nursing homes, and particularly accident and emergency departments for 72 hours after their symptoms have stopped. There have also been outbreaks of the virus in other health facilities, such as nursing homes and crèche facilities.</P>
      <P>My Department has taken a number of steps to assist in controlling the virus. The National Disease Surveillance Centre has issued guidelines for institutions relating to hygiene and infection control. An expert group, the national viral gastroenteritis committee, has been established to deal with the practical aspects relevant to the management of outbreaks of this infection and to develop guidelines relating to the rapid diagnosis and management of outbreaks for the end of the year. The winter vomiting virus is now recognised as a major problem across European countries. At Ireland's request, the EU is to establish an expert group which will deal with these issues on an EU wide basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in developing alternatives to hospitalisation within the mental health services. Health boards have developed, and are continuing to develop, a modern comprehensive community based mental health service. This has resulted in a continuing decline in the <Col N="1660" /> number of in-patients with a corresponding increase in the range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services. At 31 December 2001 there were 4,256 patients in psychiatric hospitals and units compared to 12,484 in December 1984.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to continue the growth in alternatives to hospitalisation with the further development of community based services throughout the country. Additional revenue funding of &euro;10.473 or £8.248 million was allocated in 2002 towards the further development of community based mental health services primarily for the establishment of additional multidisciplinary teams and the recruitment of additional staff to strengthen existing services. Considerable progress has also been made in providing additional community based residential accommodation. There are now over 400 community residences. Securing local authority housing for persons suffering from the disablement of psychiatric illness remains a difficulty in some locations. However, the health boards and the efforts of voluntary housing agencies continue to improve this situation through the provision of community residential accommodation.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that while the inspector acknowledges that the continued residence in long-stay psychiatric hospitals of many elderly persons is neither appropriate nor best suited to their needs, he accepts that they are well cared for.</P>

      <P>The development of facilities at Ennis General Hospital is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance. The preparation of an outline development control plan, DCP, is the first step to be taken in the process of upgrading this hospital. The brief for this part of the work is almost finalised. The DCP, when complete, will assist the board in identifying the scope of the first phase of developments on the Ennis General Hospital site. Following receipt of the DCP, the board will be in a position to decide on a timescale in the context of its overall priorities and the resources available at that time.</P>

      <P>I am concerned by the long delays experienced <Col N="1661" /> by some women waiting for a routine smear test result. I am advised, based on the latest information available, that waiting times for such results vary depending on the laboratory and can range from periods of three weeks up to those referred to by the Deputy. However, where cervical smears are urgent, results are available within a fortnight in the majority of cases. In a minority of instances, the waiting time can extend to four weeks.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to facilitating a reduction in waiting times for routine smear test results. To this end, additional funding has been provided over the last few years for the development of cervical cytology laboratories in terms of additional staffing, equipment and the introduction of new technology. Furthermore, my Department has recently approved the piloting of a proposed contingency plan to assist in overcoming capacity problems in the cervical cytology laboratories. This plan involves the contracting out of the analysis of cervical smears to a laboratory abroad, subject to compliance with the requirements set out in the December 1999 document, Quality Assurance Guidelines for the Irish National Cervical Screening Programme.</P>
      <P>Phase one of the national cervical screening programme has been up and running in the Mid-Western Health Board since October 2000. Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to the full extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The experience gained from phase one should be of assistance in the context of implementing this commitment. The process of planning and organising the national programme is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications that requires careful consideration. Following discussions with my Department on the matter, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll-out of the national programme. In this context, I understand the chief executive officers are currently paying particular attention to the need to have an external review of phase one carried out and also to ensure appropriate governance structures are in place for managing the national programme.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the initial implementation phase of a national programme in general practice for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease which commenced on 1 October 2002. The programme is being undertaken by my Department and the health authority or boards in partnership with the Irish college of General Practitioners and the Irish Heart Foundation. This programme funds part of the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy. The programme is being overseen by a national steering committee chaired by Professor John Feely, professor of pharmacology and therapeutics, and consists of key stakeholders.</P>
      <P>The selection criteria for GPs to the programme have been agreed and are being issued to GPs at present. It is envisaged that all GPs participating in the programme will be recruited by early 2003. It is planned that the initial phase will run until the end of 2003 and the continuation of the programme will be based on independent evaluation to be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the initial phase about 13,000 patients will be treated under this programme by 440 GPs throughout the country. Patients with a history of the following areas are eligible for the first phase and will be invited to join the programme: proven myocardial infarction &ndash; MI; coronary artery bypass graft &ndash; CABG or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty &ndash; PTCA. A national programme centre is being established and managed by a programme director and programme manager. In addition, an independent data centre will also be established as a collection point for <Col N="1663" /> all data returned by GPs and their practices. It will distribute aggregated clean data to key interested parties, including health boards. Patient and GP confidentiality is secured through the structural arrangements being put in place.</P>
    <P>The aim of the programme is to implement and evaluate the first phase of a structured programme of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The specific objectives are to examine the baseline levels of risk factors and therapeutic interventions relevant to secondary prevention and their trends over time; to examine the processes involved in implementing the programme including the referral process and patient retention and to record the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients participating in the programme. An independent evaluation of the initial phase will be commissioned by the national steering committee to recommend on the continuation and or expansion of the programme post the initial phase period of one year.</P>

    <P>This falls considerably short of the national target of 95% which is required to provide population immunity. At these levels of vaccine uptake, I am concerned that there will be further measles outbreaks with serious consequences for morbidity and mortality in children in this country.</P>
    <P>A national immunisation steering committee was established by health board chief executives in 2001 to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes including the identification of issues <Col N="1664" /> hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The report of the steering committee, which I launched on 22 April this year, is the first step towards improving immunisation uptake and also enhancing and developing the key systems which underpin the immunisation programmes. To implement the recommendations contained in the report the health board chief executive officers established a national immunisation implementation group in July this year. This group is currently looking at measures which, when implemented, will improve vaccine uptake levels.</P>
    <P>To reassure the public as to the safety of MMR vaccine and to address the negative coverage on this issue which adds to the confusion of parents in deciding whether to vaccinate their children, earlier this year I launched a document entitled &ldquo;Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine Discussion Pack &ndash; an information guide for health professionals and parents&rdquo;. The pack was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the department of public health, Southern Health Board, and was published by the Health Boards Executive on behalf of the health boards. This document sets out the facts on the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The pack addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism, the safety of the vaccine, combined versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine.</P>
    <P>The primary concern of the Department of Health and Children on immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The Irish Medicines Board and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland support the use of MMR on the grounds that it has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective vaccine. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>

      <P>Directions on the recruitment and selection of staff to children's residential centres were issued by my Department in November 1994. Under these directions employers must obtain Garda clearance on all staff being considered for appointment to a children's residential centre. In September 1995, these directions were extended to the recruitment of staff to any area of the health services where they would have substantial access to children and vulnerable individuals. The directions include standard documentation to be used as part of the Garda clearance procedure. The directions also stress that it is important that employers validate information supplied by candidates and verify references proactively.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, that, as a result of a review by the Garda Commissioner, it was decided that a central vetting unit would be set up to deal with the known demand for clearances. The unit commenced operation in January 2002. Since the unit commenced operating it has dealt with in the region of 69,000 vetting and data protection requests. It has also reduced the length of time taken to process vetting requests for Irish workers to within a period of three weeks.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána are now in discussions seeking ways of extending the service in the child care area to cover, for example, community workers, part-time employees, etc. My Department has been informed of these discussions and will be kept up to date on developments. It is hoped to achieve some early progress in the matter.</P>
      <P>I understand that Part 4 of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001, obliges convicted sex offenders &ndash; which includes persons convicted abroad as well as in this jurisdiction, and before as well as after the commencement of the Act &ndash; when seeking or accepting employment or a voluntary position involving unsupervised access to children, to inform their prospective employer of the fact of the conviction. Failure to do so is an offence attracting a maximum penalty, when convicted, of a fine not exceeding &euro;12,697 and/or imprisonment for up to five years. This new offence, which came into operation on 27 September 2001, along with the rest of the Act, is designed to act as a deterrent to unsuitable persons from seeking to gain access to children through the workplace, where relationships based on trust or fear can develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth stressing that, irrespective of whatever clearance arrangements are in place, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for jobs particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse. There will con<Col N="1666" /> tinue to be a particular onus of care on employers-organisations to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage, for example, good interviewing practice, checking references and, also, when it comes to ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</P>

      <P>The current structures in the health system evolved from a model developed more than 30 years ago. During that time, the size, range of <Col N="1668" /> functions and the complexity of managing the system have all grown dramatically. The strengths and weaknesses of the system were discussed during the health strategy consultation process. The main conclusion was that while the system has served well in many respects, some significant concerns remain. These include the need for stronger co-ordination and integration of functions and services, greater consistency in access to services and delivery of services throughout the country and greater clarity around levels of decision-making in the full range of organisations and the requirement for &ldquo;whole system&rdquo; effectiveness. The strategy identified an independent audit of organisational structures and functions in the health system as one of a number of actions aimed at achieving the required improved co-ordination, integration and consistency of service delivery.</P>
      <P>My Department awarded a contract to perform an audit of the structures and functions in the health system to Prospectus Strategy Consultants on 19 June 2002. The audit is due for completion early in 2003. The purpose of the consultancy project is to determine whether the structures in the health system: are the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future service needs; constitute an adequate framework for overall governance of the health system; achieve an effective integration of services across all parts of the system; adequately represent the views of consumers in the planning and delivery of services; focus sufficiently upon the principles of equity, accountability, quality and people-centredness and the national goals of the health strategy; and to recommend any changes believed to be necessary as a result of the analysis, including an implementation strategy for any changes proposed.</P>
      <P>The audit is critically examining: the number and configuration of existing health organisations &ndash; there are more than 50 agencies in the system including health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority; their interaction with one another and the Department of Health and Children; the adequacy of governance arrangements; and the scope for rationalisation. The audit is now well under way and has just entered its consultative phase. Its primary focus is to establish the organisational improvements needed to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and growth, modernisation and reform set out in the &ldquo;Quality and Fairness&rdquo; strategy document.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the delivery of orthodontic services is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards in the first instance. The chief executive officers established a review group on the public orthodontic service which is considering the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the context both of the historical development of the service and of the national health strategy. The chairperson of this group has informed me that it was established on 23 April 2002 with the following terms of reference: to review and report on progress to date on the recommendations set out in the Moran report; to consider the recommendations in the February 2002 report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children; and to make revised recommendations and prepare and cost an action plan in the context of the approach set out in the national health strategy &ldquo;Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for you&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following people were nominated to the group: chairman, Mr. Paul Robinson, chief executive officer, North Eastern Health Board; deputy chair, Mr. Billy Moran; Mr. Brian Burke, consultant orthodontist, East Coast Area Health Board; Mr. Ted McNamara, consultant orthodontist, Mid-Western Health Board; Ms Jane Davis, consultant orthodontist, South Eastern Health Board; Mr. Gerry Kieran, consultant maxiofacial surgeon, Mid-Western Health Board; Mr. Pat Gaughan, assistant chief executive, North Western Health Board &ndash; now chief executive officer Midland Health Board; Ms Jane Redehan, principal dental surgeon, Northern Area Health Board; and Mr. Gerry O'Dwyer, deputy general man<Col N="1670" /> ager, Cork University Hospital, Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the group has informed me that the members of the group contributed to its work using a modern communications tool that enabled them to communicate by e-mail. Accordingly, the group only needed to formally meet on two occasions, namely 23 May 2002 and 1 October 2002. I also understand from the chairman that one member of the group refused to participate in the process. The work of this group will inform the development of an orthodontic action plan, which was one of the recommendations of the joint committee.</P>

      <P>My Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are engaged in a joint project to modernise the civil registration service. The focus in the initial stage of the project is the introduction of new systems, procedures and legislation to facilitate the electronic registration of vital events including births, stillbirths, deaths, marriages and adoptions and the electronic production of certificates. In addition the archival records held by the General Register Office and the associated indices are being converted to an electronic format in a separate project in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The legal changes necessary to enable the direct electronic registration of births and deaths and the holding of birth death and marriage records in an electronic format were included in the Social Welfare Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2002. The other provisions required to facilitate the wider modernisation of the registration service are being included in a new civil registration Bill, which is currently being drafted.</P>
      <P>The modernisation of the civil registration service is a key building block underpinning the integration of public service delivery and e-government objectives of providing more convenient access to services and will facilitate the sharing of information between Government agencies. It is proposed that future registration of vital events will include a personal public service number &ndash; PPS No. &ndash; which will be used as a unique customer reference number by public service bodies, including the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme. The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their <Col N="1672" /> children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this programme. Information provided by the Irish Medicines Board, which has responsibility for licensing all pharmaceutical products in Ireland, indicates that individual vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are currently licensed in Ireland, however, only single dose rubella vaccine is marketed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are sound public health reasons for not administering the MMR as separate vaccines. First, the scientific evidence does not support a link between MMR and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. There is no evidence that administering the three components of MMR as separate vaccines is safer. The immune system is well capable of responding to the small number of components in the MMR vaccine and there is no evidence that the component parts of the MMR vaccine interfere with each other. In any event, vaccines are designed to strengthen the immune system and not weaken it.</P>
      <P>If the vaccines were to be given separately, this would also mean a child requiring a total of six injections to complete the course instead of two which could also mean an increased risk of local reactions at the injection site. The practical aspect of giving six injections would mean that children are unprotected for a greater period of time from these diseases and, therefore, at significantly greater risk of contracting these infections. The protracted time involved in administering the vaccines would result in the diseases in question circulating in the community for longer. Unprotected children would, therefore, be at greater risk of catching these infections. This would include younger children &ndash; that is, children below the age of 15 months &ndash; and children who are immuno-suppressed.</P>
      <P>Most countries implement a two dose MMR vaccine programme and this policy has been very successful in controlling measles where high uptake of the vaccine has been achieved. My primary concern and that of my Department in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that existing research and medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting. The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the British Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, USA, the American Academy of Paediatr<Col N="1673" /> ics, the World Health Organisation, and UK professional organisations.</P>
    <P>Recent studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years during which MMR vaccine was introduced. A recent UK study where researchers analysed 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. In recent weeks, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> published details of a study of more than 500,000 children born in Denmark between January 1991 and December 1998 which indicated that the risk of autism was the same for children regardless of whether they were vaccinated with MMR.</P>
    <P>In a statement on 14 November 2002, the Irish Medicines Board advised parents and doctors against the use of unlicensed single component measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. Specifically, the IMB has concerns about the manufacture, testing and storage of the single component vaccines Pavivac &ndash; single mumps vaccine &ndash; and Movivac &ndash; single measles vaccine &ndash; as there is insufficient information about these two vaccines to be able to offer any assurances about the safety, quality or efficacy of these products which are manufactured by Sevapharma in the Czech Republic. The IMB's counterpart in the UK, the Medicines Control Agency, has issued similar recommendations pending further investigation. The IMB further stated that the two combined MMR vaccines &ndash; MMR II and Priorix &ndash; cur<Col N="1674" /> rently in use in the childhood immunisation programme in Ireland have undergone rigorous assessment and are licensed by the IMB.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme to ensure that both children and the population generally have maximum protection against the disease concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contra-indications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>
    <P>The immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland recommends that all health care workers born after 1978 should have proof of immunity to measles, mumps and rubella or evidence of two doses of MMR. Vaccination should be considered for non-immune health workers working with pregnant women or those working in paediatric, obstetric or emergency departments.</P>
    <P>The following table indicates the number of hospital discharges for publicly funded acute hospitals for the period 1995-2001 for diseases of the bowel and for the number of bowel removal procedures undertaken. The data are derived from the hospital in-patient enquiry &ndash; HIPE &ndash; system and relate to children under the age of 15 years. It should be noted that these figures refer to hospital episodes rather than to individuals. It should also be noted that prior to 1995 the HIPE system did not have comprehensive coverage of all cases within hospitals and that since 1995 a number of additional hospitals are now submitting data to HIPE.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Private Health Insurance set out the Government's proposals regarding the corporate status of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. This provided for the establishment of the VHI as a company under the Companies Acts, with full commercial freedom of operation, in the ownership of the Minister for Finance. The possibility of third party investment and eventual full sale of the State's interest in VHI, if deemed desirable by the Government, were also addressed in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>Further to the White Paper, corporate financial and legal advisers were engaged to examine the strategic options for the VHI and they have reported. The advice provided by the consultants are currently under consideration in my Department. The VHI board is in favour of it being privatised and this has been noted in the context of the consideration to be given to VHI's future. Ultimately, proposals by the Government for a change in VHI's corporate status will require legislation and will, therefore, arise for consideration and discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>The main recommendations in the report are as follows: the consultation process involving complementary therapists and other stakeholders <Col N="1676" /> should be continued and developed; voluntary self-regulation of individual therapies should be strengthened; individual therapies should be encouraged to establish registers of qualified members; research should be carried out on the efficacy and outcomes of complementary and alternative therapies and the evidence base for each therapy; and, as part of the consultation process, a national working group should be set up to examine and consider regulatory issues. Other activities of the proposed national working group would include: gathering statistics on complementary therapies in Ireland; gathering information on educational programmes being provided; and developing an agreed approach to continuous professional development, CPD, with the bodies representing individual therapies.</P>
    <P>At the launch of the report on 14 November, I announced the establishment of the national working group which will progress the implementation of the recommendations of the report. This working group will be chaired by Ms Teri Garvey, the broadcaster and educationalist.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made to date by the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, which was established in February 2002; if he will urge the commission to expedite the publication of its report having regard to public concerns about human cloning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject of cloning is one that raises a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues with associated legal, ethical, social and medical implications. While there is no legislation regulating this area, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These provide that the creation of embryos for experimental purposes would be professional misconduct. I am conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate cloning and a range of other issues associated with the area of assisted human reproduction, including research on embryos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, a Commission <Col N="1677" /> on Assisted Human Reproduction was established in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area&rdquo;.  The commission has met on 15 occasions to date. The first meeting was held on 26 July 2000 and the most recent on 14 November 2002.</P>
    <P>I understand the commission has adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its work. Initially, each discipline &ndash; medical, legal, scientific and social &ndash; prepared a report outlining the current position within that discipline in relation to assisted human reproduction. Working groups were then formed to examine specific topics and issues that needed to be addressed. The working groups meet on a regular basis to discuss their tasks and to progress the work of the commission. I have been informed that the work group structure facilitates close attention to a relatively limited range of topics by a highly specialised group. It also facilitates the detailed exploration of a range of ethical and social implications that arise from assisted human reproduction.</P>
    <P>The commission organised a one day conference for its members and an invited audience of about 30, in Dublin Castle in September 2001. The conference dealt with the social, ethical and legal factors inherent in assisted human reproduction. It provided an opportunity for an exchange of views between experts in the various fields from Ireland, the UK, France and Germany.</P>
    <P>When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. In order to inform itself on the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction, the commission placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting interested members of the public, professional or voluntary organisations and other parties who wished to do so to make written submissions before Wednesday, 31 October 2001. Over 1,600 submissions were received by the commission.</P>
    <P>I understand the commission has engaged in a number of information gathering exercises that include: (i) survey of assisted human reproduction services provided in specialised clinics. A survey instrument was drafted by the commission with a view to establishing the extent of the provision of assisted human reproduction services in Ireland; (ii) survey of GPs &ndash; the commission issued a survey instrument to a random sample of 50% of GPs in all health board areas. I understand that a high proportion of those surveyed responded; (iii) survey of obstetricians and gynaecologists &ndash; the commission also issued a survey instrument to obstetricians and gynaecologists to elicit information on their level of involvement in assisted human reproductive services.</P>
    <P>The various working groups are now nearing the end of their specific tasks. I understand that <Col N="1678" /> as part of its ongoing consultation and to assist in shaping its final report, the commission will hold a public workshop in February 2003.</P>
    <P>Given the difficult nature of the issues to be examined it is not possible to be definitive about the length of time it will take the commission to complete its work, but I am satisfied that it is making significant progress and will continue to work as expeditiously as is feasible. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the recruitment of staff and for monitoring the level of vacancies in the health service lies with the employing health agency. My Department does not routinely collect data on vacancy levels in individual grades. Discussions are ongoing with the chief executive officers of the health boards in relation to the measures required to ensure the most effective and timely monitoring of employment trends. In addition, continued investment in information technology together with the development of integrated workforce planning for the health service on a national basis &ndash; a key action specified in the health strategy &ndash; is expected to make a major contribution, in the future, to the provision of quality employment related information and the development of a human resource inventory for the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels where necessary, both at local and national level. As set out in the table attached, significant progress has been made in this respect over the past two years. Relevant developments include the provision of an increased number of training places, for example, in psychology, social care and the therapy pro<Col N="1679" /> fessions. Concerted recruitment of health care professionals from overseas is also being carried out.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the quality of patient care is maintained, health service employers minimise the impact on service provision of vacancies in key health professional grades through the use of overtime, agency staff, locums, contract staff and by adjusting the skills mix as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the action plan for people management, action 108 of the health strategy, which was launched on 7 November 2002, has a crucial role to play in boosting the capacity of the health service to retain scarce skilled health care personnel. Additional initiat<Col N="1680" /> ives, with regard to the grades referred to by the Deputy, include the establishment of a national social work forum to progress a number of key concerns for social workers, including the introduction of a new grade, the upgrading of other posts and a workload management study which is intended to facilitate the most effective use of social work time.</P>
    <P>With regard to child care workers, the Deputy will wish to note that the joint committee on child care, which was established to deal with the issues arising from the professional autonomy of the child care profession, is expected to report shortly. This is expected to assist in maximising the contribution of the profession to the delivery of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Extensive research continues to be conducted worldwide in relation to the MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation has indicated that MMR vaccine does not cause autism and that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the existing research and medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. The institutions include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC USA and the American Academy of Paediatrics.</P>
      <P>Recent studies by the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting. A large Finnish study involving 1.8 million individuals demonstrated that no case of inflammatory bowel disease or autism was linked to the MMR vaccine. A similar Swedish study found no increase in cases of autism in the ten years during which MMR vaccine was introduced. A recent UK study where researchers analysed some 2,000 studies from 180 countries found no evidence of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. In recent weeks, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> published details of a study of more than 500,000 children born in Denmark between January 1991 and December 1998 which indicated that the risk of autism was the same for children regardless of whether or not they were vaccinated with MMR.</P>
      <P>The primary concern of my Department in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The Irish Medicines Board and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland support the use of MMR on the grounds that it has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective vaccine. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an increase in recent years in the numbers of children being diagnosed with autism. Similar increases have also been experienced in other European countries and in the USA. The diagnosis of autism is a clinical one, that is, it is based on a variety of observations rather than a defined laboratory investigation. Hence the evolving concept of an &ldquo;autistic spectrum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability. There is increasing recognition of autism in Ireland and in other countries. What is not clear, however, is whether the increase is due to a greater awareness leading to better ascertain<Col N="1681" /> ment, or whether there is actually a true increase in the prevalence of autism.</P>
    <P>In recent years, as part of the overall planning and development of services for persons with autism, the health boards have been obtaining additional information on the needs of this group in their regions, and in particular in relation to those who require or will require specialist services. My Department is working with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to establish an information system which will provide accurate data in relation to the numbers of persons with autism and their service needs. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority for information in relation to the numbers of children with autism known to them in their regions and the number of new cases presenting annually. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, CE, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality, and co-ordinate reductions so as to minimise any negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced and projects in RAPID areas are given top priority. CE places in the health sector are being maintained at the start of the year level to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services. The Department of Health and Children, in conjunction with the health boards executive, HeBE, is currently examining the position regarding the mainstreaming of health related services and a <Col N="1682" /> decision on mainstreaming will be made in the near future.</P>
    <P>FÁS is currently undertaking an internal review of CE, and the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is also being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE taking account of the link with the provision of community services. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of the CE programme.</P>

      <P>The national minimum wage was introduced in Ireland on 1 April 2000. At its introduction, the national minimum hourly rate of pay was set at £4.40, &euro;5.59, per hour, which was the minimum rate to be paid to an experienced adult worker. Two increases to this rate were agreed by the social partners and accepted by Government as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The first of these increased the rate to £4.70, &euro;5.97, per hour and was effective from 1 July 2001 and the second came into effect on 1 October 2002 increasing the rate to £5.00, &euro;6.35, per hour. All employees aged 18 and over are entitled to be paid by their employer the national minimum hourly rate of pay in respect of the employee's working hours in any pay reference period, unless a sub-minimum rate of the national minimum hourly rate of pay applies in respect of that employee.</P>

      <P>FÁS, which has operational responsibility for the community employment programme, in assessing CE applications prioritises projects that provide good quality work experience and training to individual participants, taking into account the types of services provided and the levels of unemployment in the locality. In this context, FÁS has discretion to extend, on a case by case basis, an individual's term on CE, having regard to that individual's personal development needs and future employment prospects. In the case of people aged over 50 years the three year cap on participation has been removed where people in this age group, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment. For such participants FÁS may offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS prioritises projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and co-ordinates reductions in CE <Col N="1685" /> places so as to minimise any negative effects on groups and services most in need of CE. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given top priority. CE places in the health sector &ndash; which includes personal assistant services &ndash; are being maintained at the start of the year level to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services. Due consideration is also given by FÁS to the importance of the scheme in rural communities, where there may be limited opportunities for potential applicants to engage in training and/or employment.</P>

      <P>The person named participated in the 2001 extensification premium opting for the simplified system undertaking to keep the stocking density of his holding to less than 1.60 livestock units per hectare for each and every day of 2001. Under EU regulations, at pre-payment stage the Department is obliged to carry out stocking density cross-checks against the its cattle movement and monitoring system, CMMS. In this case, the Department carried out two stocking density cross-checks against CMMS &ndash; one at 1 June 2001 and another at 15 October 2001. Respective stocking densities of 1.2862 and 1.7818 livestock units per hectare were found and, accordingly, the person named has been found ineligible for 2001 extensification premium. In order that the person named can check the accuracy of the findings at 15 October 2001, arrangements have been made for the issue of a herd profile which can be expected shortly. The profile will show the date of birth of each animal over the age of six months found per CMMS to have been present on the holding on 15 October 2001.</P>

      <Col N="1688" />The holding of the person named was one of a number selected for special audit inspection in accordance with EU regulations. The results of this inspection are being finalised and are due to be completed by the end of the month. Until this audit exercise is completed, no arable payments or area related payments can be made to the person named.</P>
    <P>The person named has 41 animals eligible under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme for slaughtering during the period January to September 2002. Payment for the amount of &euro;2,624, which represents an 80% advance payment on the 41 animals, issued on 16 October 2002. The person named also had seven animals slaughtered on 2 October 2002.</P>
    <P>The person named has submitted five applications in respect of 19 animals under the 2002 special beef premium scheme. The first four applications are processed to payment stage but payments cannot issue until the outstanding area aid issues are resolved. The fifth application, which was submitted on the 14 October 2002, will be processed for payment following the completion of the two month retention period, subject to compliance with scheme requirements.</P>

      <P>With regard to State bodies which come under the aegis of my Department, the issue of charges is a day to day matter in which I have no function. The only increase in charges which my Department has sanctioned relates to seed testing. Fees for seed testing carried out by the seed testing station of my Department to determine the germination and purity of seeds are generally increased on an annual basis. The last increase was in July 2002. While there are 16 different price categories, ranging from &euro;5 to &euro;60, the increase applied to each category varies but the overall average increase was about 4%.</P>

      <P>Unless the person named wishes to participate in schemes for which there are specific stocking density limits, there is no obligation on <Col N="1689" /> him to observe any stocking density limit. He must, however, comply with legislation intended to protect the environment, prevent pollution and must observe animal welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted five applications in respect of a total of 42 animals under the 2002 special beef premium. On 16 October 2002, 80% advance payment issued on the herdowner's first three applications in respect of 22 animals. The remaining two applications submitted in October in respect of 20 animals have been processed to payment stage by the special beef premium unit. Payment in respect of these animals will issue following the completion of the two month retention period, subject to compliance with scheme requirements. If the Deputy gives more specific information in relation to any problems in regard to stocking density in the case of the person named, I will have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>The area aid application of the person named indicates that the total forage area for premia payment purposes is 24.67 hectares. This allows for payment up to 46.87 livestock units &ndash; that is, 1.9 livestock units of premium per hectare. To date, under the special beef premium scheme, the herd owner has utilised 25.20 livestock units and is, therefore, well within the permitted stocking density limits for bovine premia schemes.</P>
      <P>In relation to 2002 extensification premium, the person named opted to participate under the census system. Based on the same 24.67 hectares forage area, if the stocking density is verified as being up to but not exceeding 1.80 livestock units per hectare, he should qualify for payment of 2002 extensification premium provided, of course, that he complies with all of the requirements necessary to secure premium.</P>
      <P>The person named qualified for a payment of &euro;2192.67 under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. However, a recoupment of &euro;136 was outstanding under the 2001 special beef premium scheme, in respect of a female bovine, tag number 27131556004, applied on under that scheme on 24 December 2001, resulting in an overpayment of &euro;136. The person named informed my Department of his error, and the animal was deleted from his application. The overpayment was withheld from his 2002 area-based compensatory allowance grant and a net payment of &euro;2056.67 issued to him on 23 September 2002.</P>

      <P>In its proposals for the present early retirement scheme, which commenced in November 2000, my Department had made provision for annual increases in the rate of pension. However, the European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set for the full period of the CAP rural development plan 2000-2006. Any changes to these provisions would have to be introduced by way of an amendment to the CAP rural development plan with the agreement of the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The rate of pension payable under the 1994 early retirement scheme is the maximum provided for in the EU Council regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments. A number of changes to the scheme that did not require formal Commission approval have already been implemented, but I have no plans at present to seek changes to the provisions included in the CAP rural development plan.</P>

      <P>The current threshold above which the health contribution is payable is &euro;356 per week or &euro;18,512 per year. Once the threshold is exceeded, the contribution is payable on all reckonable income unless such income or the person in receipt of same falls within an exempt category, the main examples of which are set out below. Provision for exemptions from liability for the health contribution is a matter primarily for the Minister for Health and Children, however, all persons over the age of 16 years are liable to pay the health contribution on their reckonable earnings, emoluments or income subject to the following main exemptions:</P>
      <P>(i)&nbsp;income at or below the threshold of &euro;356 per week or &euro;18,512 per year;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" />(ii) individuals in receipt of the following social welfare payments-pensions (as provided for by the Health Contributions Act, 1979, as amended by section 24 of the Social Welfare Act, 1995):</P>
    <P>(a) survivor's pension;</P>
    <P>(b) widow's (non-contributory) pension;</P>
    <P>(c) deserted wife's benefit; </P>
    <P>(d) deserted wife's allowance;</P>
    <P>(e) death benefit by way of a pension;</P>
    <P>(f) lone parent's allowance (now the one-parent family payment);</P>
    <P>(g) a payment corresponding to a pension at (a) or (e) above from an EU member state;</P>
    <P>(h) individuals who qualify for a medical card in the State;</P>
    <P>(i) individuals who qualify for the equivalent of a medical card in another EU member state;</P>
    <P>(iii) payments under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that maintenance payments are allowed as a deduction to the payer before computing the health contribution payable. In relation to (i) above, where an individual pays the health contribution during the year because his or her weekly income exceeds the weekly ceiling, he or she can claim a refund of any health contribution deducted if his or her <Col N="1692" /> total income for the year does not exceed the relevant annual ceiling.</P>
    <P>For the current tax year the health contribution is charged at a rate of 2% and it is estimated that in 2002 the health contribution will yield &euro;739 million as an appropriation-in-aid to the Health and Children Vote. In relation to the last part of the Deputy's question, I am sure he will appreciate that it is not the general practice of the Minister for Finance to comment in the run up to it on changes which may or may not be included in the annual budget.</P>

      <P>Appropriations-in-aid are receipts arising in the normal course of a Department's or office's ordinary vote business and which may be retained by that Department or Office to meet expenditure instead of being paid directly to the Exchequer. The following table shows the total value of appropriations-in-aid in 2003 by ministerial Vote group and the comparable 2002 forecast outturn. The 2002 estimates for appropriations-in-aid are also included for information as there are projected shortfalls in appropriations-in-aid to the amount of &euro;183 million in 2002. These shortfalls arise mainly from delayed ESF receipts and a once-off adjustment to health levy receipts in 2002, due largely to a rebalancing between the health levy and PRSI receipts relating to pay overs in previous years.</P>

Were tax relief to be allowed on such registration fees at the standard rate of tax, it is estimated that the cost in terms of tax foregone would be in the region of &euro;11 million in a full year. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the most up-to-date information available on the cost of tax relief for third level tuition fees is in respect of the income tax year 1999 to 2000 when some 8,000 claims for tax relief were allowed at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;3 million.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not maintain separate records of the stamp duty paid by first time buyers <i>per se</i>. However, they do have records of the stamp duty paid by first time buyers who qualify for reduced rates under first time buyer relief which was introduced by the Finance (No. <Col N="1694" /> 2) Act, 2000, with the insertion of a new section 92B into the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999. This section provides relief by way of exemption or reduced rate from certain rates of duty otherwise applicable on the purchase of second-hand houses and apartments where the buyer qualifies as a first time buyer and complies with certain conditions attaching to the relief. The Revenue Commissioners estimate that the yield foregone by eliminating stamp duty for first time buyers who qualify for relief under section 92B would be in the region of &euro;2.4 million per annum.</P>
      <P>In the case of new houses and apartments, all owner occupiers, including first time buyers, are generally exempt from stamp duty where the property is 125 square metres or less. The Revenue Commissioners do not have an estimate of the Exchequer cost of this relief in relation to first time buyers. There are no records concerning the amount of stamp duty paid by first time buyers who do not qualify for relief and who consequently pay duty at the normal rates applicable. In the case of second hand houses, this arises where consideration is in excess of &euro;381,000. In the case of new houses and apartments, a first time buyer may have a stamp duty liability if purchasing a new house or apartment over 125 square metres, if the site value is in excess of &euro;190,500 or the total value is in excess of &euro;762,000. It is also the case that where the first time buyer is not going to occupy the house or apartment as his or her only or principal place of residence, then the normal rates of stamp duty apply.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it has been the practice for many years for the Minister for Finance not to comment on possible changes in taxation in the weeks prior to the budget.</P>

In view of the wide and varied range of issues which need to be considered in the preparation of a new programme, I cannot, at this time, say when the Government will be able to take decisions in relation to a new programme.

      <P>The Government remains committed to the NDP objective of more balanced regional development. Under the regionalisation agreement negotiated by the Government under Agenda 2000, significant benefits were conferred on the less developed Border, midlands and western regions, including an additional &euro;595 million in structural funds assistance, a higher EU co-financing rate of 75% for individual projects and a more generous state aids regime which is of assistance in attracting increased investment. The Government is conscious of the infrastructure needs of the BMW region and will seek to address this through the NDP infrastructure programme and other measures. The Government is also conscious of the major bottlenecks and congestion affecting urban areas in the southern and eastern regions and addressing this situation must also be a major priority for resources available for investment in infrastructure. I anticipate that the mid-term review of the plan, to be completed next year, will address its impact on balanced regional development. The Government has recently approved the publication of the national spatial strategy and this will be launched by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government shortly. The national spatial strategy is a 20 year planning framework and it aims to achieve a better balance of social, economic, physical development and population growth between regions, with the objective of having a positive impact on balanced regional development.</P>

    <P>The Civil Service crèche in Mount Street, Dublin, closed in September, 2000 following an inspection by the Eastern Health Board, which indicated that the premises did not meet the required standards, and was subsequently refurbished to a high standard by the Office of Public Works. To minimise disruption to parents, a child care provider had to be found as quickly as possible. A suitable commercial company was found and, as part of a temporary arrangement to ensure the reopening of the crèche, was paid a monthly management fee from public funds. For its part, the new operator agreed to hold the fees below market levels as much as possible. The crèche reopened and is offering children care of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>Budget 2001 allocated funds for crèches for the children of civil servants throughout Ireland. An interim agency was established in 2002 to manage the development of premises and the selection of providers. A new crèche is about to open in Marlborough Street, Dublin, and work has <Col N="1697" /> started on projects in Ennis, Athlone and Sligo. Other crèches are being planned. It was decided to include the crèche in Mount Street within the new structure. Earlier this year, tenders were sought from child care providers for the operation of the Mount Street crèche and the new project in Marlborough Street and following an open process, licences have been awarded to a provider. Under the new arrangement, no monthly fee is paid to the operator of the Mount Street crèche and this has resulted in the fee increases. It must be pointed out that, as the premises are provided free of rent and, as the cost of heat, light and equipment is met from public funds, the fees in Mount Street are still considerably below those charged in comparable crèches in Dublin city centre.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's reference to Kurdistan as <Col N="1698" /> meaning those areas of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria in which the majority of the population has traditionally been of Kurdish ethnic origin. As regards Turkey, which is a candidate for EU membership, the Government, in common with our EU partners, has expressed its concern about the situation relating specifically to Kurdish issues, including the imprisonment of members of DEP, a political party widely regarded as having represented the Kurdish perspective, the closure case against HADEP, DEP's successor, and the limitations on freedom of expression in the Kurdish language. The Irish embassy continues to monitor the human rights situation in Turkey.</P>
      <P>I welcome the three sets of human rights reforms which have been adopted in Turkey this year. Application of the death penalty has been abolished in peacetime. The state of emergency in two provinces of the south east has been lifted and the decision taken to lift it in the two provinces where it still applies by the end of the year. Broadcasting and education in languages other than Turkish have now been authorised. All of these measures, if fully implemented, will undoubtedly enhance the cultural and ethnic rights of all citizens of Turkey, including those of Kurdish origin. I share the view taken by the EU Commission in its regular report on Turkey's progress towards accession for 2002 that the reforms provide much of the ground work for strengthening democracy and the protection of human rights in Turkey. I also accept that the reforms contain a number of significant limitations on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms and that to be effective they need to be implemented in practice by executive and judicial bodies throughout Turkey. I take this opportunity to encourage the new Turkish Government to continue to enact the regulations quickly in order to ensure that the letter and spirit of the reforms can take effect without delay.</P>
      <P>No specific approaches in respect of Kurds have been made recently to the Governments of the other countries in which a Kurdish minority resides. However, the general human rights situation in these countries, as in other countries, is kept under review and is addressed as necessary in <i>démarches </i>relating to individual cases or in relevant UN fora where human rights are considered. Together with our partners in the European Union, the Government will continue to work to ensure that our concerns about human rights are highlighted in contacts with the relevant Governments. Kurdish matters have not appeared on the agenda of the UN Security Council, however, in Resolution 1441, adopted on 8 November, the Security Council reaffirmed the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, Kuwait, and the neighbouring states.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the partial easing of the US embargo against Cuba, after a vote by the US Congress in October 2000 to lift the ban on the sale of food and medicines, has not been followed up by the embargo's complete removal. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the relaxation of the embargo has enabled Cuba to purchase a considerable volume of US food products for which, however, Havana has had to pay cash as US financial institutions remain prohibited from extending credits for such sales. Ireland wishes to see a full and final end to the embargo. Together with our partners in the European Union, we have consistently supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for the embargo to be lifted. Once again, on 12 November 2002, Ireland, and all EU member states, voted in favour of the resolution tabled by Cuba calling for the abolition of the embargo and the Assembly adopted it by a vote of 173 in favour to three against, with four abstentions.</P>

      <Quest>the Government's policy in relation to the Democratic Republic of Congo.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23162/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cornerstone of the Government's policy in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo is to support the implementation of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement, all related agreements and all relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The Lusaka agreement provides a framework for a negotiated settlement which is fair to all parties, which respects the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the DRC, which upholds democratic principles and human rights and which takes account of the security interests of the DRC and all other countries of the region. During its period of membership of the UN Security Council, Ireland has been particularly concerned to ensure the full implementation of the three strands of the Lusaka agreement, the inter-Congolese dialogue, the disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration, repatriation or resettlement (DDRRR) of negative forces, and the full withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of the DRC. In 2001 and 2002, Ireland participated in ambassador level Security Council missions to the DRC and the wider region aimed at securing the implementation of the Lusaka agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the withdrawal of foreign troops, under the terms of the Pretoria and Luanda agreements signed in July and September 2002 between the DRC Government and the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda respectively, all Rwandan troops have reportedly now left the territory of the DRC, while Uganda is scheduled to complete its withdrawal by mid-December &ndash; although a small number of Ugandan troops will remain behind with the DRC's consent to ensure security in the Rwenzori mountains which border the two countries. Troops from Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe, which supported the Kinshasa <Col N="1700" /> Government, have also left the DRC. The withdrawals have been observed by MONUC, the UN observer mission in the DRC, in accordance with the terms of its mandate. MONUC is also in the process of verifying whether Rwanda has withdrawn all its forces from the DRC. Two Irish Army officers are currently serving with MONUC, which is also tasked with assisting in the voluntary disarmament of the negative forces in the DRC, including Rwandan opposition forces linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide and Burundian rebels. DRC President Joseph Kabila has recently begun to take steps to cease support for these negative forces and Ireland hopes that the Security Council will soon be in a position to authorise an increase in the strength of MONUC to support the disarmament process. Disarmament of the negative forces should lead to a reduction of hostilities in the east of the DRC and simultaneously address the security concerns of Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi which led to the 1998 war.</P>
    <P>Following the partial success of the inter-Congolese dialogue negotiations in Sun City, South Africa, earlier this year, the main Congolese parties have resumed talks in Pretoria, South Africa, on an all-inclusive transitional government in the DRC and all sides are confident that an acceptable power-sharing arrangement can be agreed by the end of this year. At the Security Council, Ireland has stressed the need for all Congolese parties to enter the negotiations in a spirit of openness and compromise. Agreement on a power sharing government is key to the peaceful resolution of the wider conflict in the DRC. To this end, we support the efforts of the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for the ICD, Mr. Mustapha Niasse. As a sign of the importance Ireland attaches to the ICD, in 2001 the Government contributed &euro;127,000 to the office of the facilitator of the dialogue, former Botswanan President, Ketumile Masire. We hope that the ICD will pave the way for a return of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights in the DRC.</P>
    <P>Despite the progress made in implementing the Lusaka agreement, a number of serious problems remain to be resolved in the DRC, not least the security situation in the east and north east of the country. In response to a number of worrying recent developments, including an upsurge in ethnically motivated violence, the Security Council agreed a presidential statement on 18 October expressing strong concern at the rising tensions in the east of the country, condemning the intensification of ethnically targeted violence in the Ituri region and stressing that no government, military force or any other organisation or individual should provide military or other supplies or any other form of support to any of the groups involved in the fighting in eastern Congo. Also of grave concern is the deplorable human rights and humanitarian situation in the DRC, particularly in the east of the country. As many as 3.5 million people have died since the current conflict broke out in mid-1998, mainly as a result of disease and malnutrition. Ireland has maintained a focus on human rights and humanitarian issues in the <Col N="1701" /> DRC since joining the Security Council and we have consistently called on the parties to refrain from human rights violations and to respect the provisions of international humanitarian law. This year Ireland has contributed &euro;2.3 million in humanitarian aid to the DRC.</P>
    <P>An issue of further serious concern in relation to the DRC war is the illegal exploitation of the DRC's resources. A panel of experts set up by the UN Secretary General at the request of the Security Council has published three reports on the exploitation of the DRC's resources and has highlighted the link between such exploitation and the continuation of the conflict. At the Security Council, Ireland has highlighted the unacceptable fact that exploitation has become both a means and a motive for sustaining the conflict, regardless of the initial motivations which led to the conflict. We have expressed particular concern at the flagrant and systematic violation of the human rights of the people of the DRC in the pursuit of natural resource exploitation. We have consistently stressed that any action taken on foot of the panel of experts reports should support the primary objective of implementing the Lusaka ceasefire agreement. Without a resolution of the broader conflict in the DRC, it will be difficult to put an end to the plundering of resources.</P>
    <P>During the open meeting of the Security Council on the final report of the panel of experts, held on 5 November, Ireland supported the panel's recommendations, including those on the need to provide incentives for countries which cease the illegal exploitation of resources and adhere to the peace agreements they have signed. We have also supported the establishment of a mechanism to monitor the exploitation of the DRC's resources on an on-going basis in a bid to discourage those who would seek to continue conflict for personal gain. While not underestimating the challenges that lie ahead for the people of the DRC, the Government is confident that with the support of the international community and the full co-operation of all parties involved in the conflict in the DRC with the MONUC mission, peace can finally be achieved in the DRC and the wider Great Lakes region.</P>

      <P>Participants on both the back to education allowance scheme and the vocational training opportunities scheme receive an allowance in lieu of their social welfare payments. This allowance is paid at a standard rate in both cases, and is equivalent to the maximum rate of the students' prior social welfare payment, and <Col N="1702" /> includes increases for qualified adults and children where applicable. The main differences in the treatment of allowances are:</P>
      <P>(i) VTOS students who have been in receipt of eligible social welfare payments for at least 12 months directly prior to joining a VTOS course receive a weekly training bonus of &euro;31.80. This bonus, which also applies to FÁS, was introduced in 1999 as an incentive to attract long-term unemployed people onto VTOS. Students attending courses under the Department of Social and Family Affairs's back to education scheme do not get this bonus.</P>
      <P>(ii) VTOS students are given books and materials free of charge, and a travel allowance is paid to students who live more than three miles from a centre. BTEA students are entitled to an annual allowance towards the cost of their studies. This allowance, which is payable at the start of the academic year, is currently &euro;254.</P>
      <P>(iii) Funds are also provided towards child care by my Department for VTOS.</P>
      <P>In terms of access criteria, the schemes both require that adults are at least 21 years of age, and at least six months &ndash; 156 days &ndash; in receipt of certain social welfare payments. However, under the BTEA, a person who is at least 18 years of age and getting disability allowance, blind pension, invalidity pension or unemployability supplement for at least six months &ndash; 156 days &ndash; or a person in receipt of disability benefit for three years or more, also qualifies for the back to education allowance. A person who is aged between 18 and 20 years, out of formal education for two years, and in receipt of an eligible social welfare payment for at least six months &ndash; 156 days &ndash; also qualifies for the BTEA.</P>

      <P>Tuition fees are paid in respect of students attending full-time undergraduate courses in one of the approved free fee institutions. The courses must be of a minimum of two years duration. All students have to register for courses at third level. There is a charge levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services. Students who are eligible for means tested student support will, in addition to any grant they are entitled to, have the &euro;670 charge paid on their behalf, either directly by my Department or through the local authorities and vocational education committees. This means that 34% of students in universities and 47% of students in institutes of technology will not have to pay the charge. Tuition fees are not charged to Irish and <Col N="1703" /> other EU nationals in respect of attendance at recognised post leaving certificate courses. In the case of non-EU nationals, tuition fees for PLC courses are charged at the rate of &euro;3,653 per annum. Registration charges by professional bodies may be payable in a small number of cases. Charges by professional bodies may vary depending on the vocational discipline and the certification authority concerned.</P>

      <P>Primary school transport routes are planned so that as far as possible no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way to a pick-up point or school. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive. The pupil to whom the Deputy refers resides within half a mile of the bus route to school. This is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme. My Department has been advised by Bus Éireann that this pupil was fortuitously provided with a home pick-up at the start of the current school year, as an old bus route was used in error. The correct bus route was restored as soon as this error was detected.</P>

      <P>It has been my Department's approach in recent years, to increase the reckonable income limits under the maintenance grant schemes, in accordance with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. This year, I approved an increase of 7% in the reckonable income limits for the 2002 to 2003 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 2000 to March 2001, which was 6.7%. I also approved a significant increase of 15% in the allowance by which the income thresholds may be increased for each dependant, where two or more children are in further or higher education. This is in line with the commitment in the June 2002 programme for Government. Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. This year, in line with this policy, I announced increases of 5% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2002. The increase of 5% in grant rates for 2002 to 2003 was higher than the reference value, which was 4.7%.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised. This review will cover a range of topics relating to the schemes of student support including the level of maintenance grants, eligibility and income limits with respect to the grants, and the free fees initiative. Decisions regarding increases in income thresholds and maintenance grant levels will not be taken, pending completion of this review and, accordingly, provision to take accounts of such increases is not reflected in the abridged book of estimates for 2003. The current income thresholds and rates of maintenance grants which apply under the 2002 schemes follows in tabular form for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling &euro;120 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the programme for prosperity and fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommendations in the report aimed at increasing participation in third level education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as top-up grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. Following a recent review, I increased the annual income thresholds for the special rates by 32%, a significant increase. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and &euro;1,600 for students resident within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a top-up of &euro;1,490 and &euro;596 respectively, for eligible students, on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-2003 will double to 7,000 students. A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-2002 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001/2002 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations. For 2002-2003, I have increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million. ADM, which is continuing to administer the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the academic year. It is <Col N="1706" /> primarily a matter for each partnership and community group to decide on the level of financial support it provides in each case, depending on its allocation and the circumstances of each applicant. Financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance access fund which, since 1999, has replaced my Department's hardship fund. The objective of the fund is to assist students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered on a discretionary basis by each institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. It is a matter for each institution to decide on the level of financial support it provides in each case, depending on the circumstances of each applicant.</P>
    <P>The measures which target students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including eligibility conditions and, where appropriate, rates of payment, are subject to periodic review within my Department. The provision for alleviation of disadvantage, as set out in the abridged Estimates volume for 2003, is &euro;26 million and I am satisfied that this represents an adequate provision for the measures aimed at targeting students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report. I have given approval for the establishment of the office under the auspices of the Higher Education Authority. I anticipate that it will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, students with a disability and mature, second chance, students in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>

      <P>I must first state that my Department is fulfilling its obligation to provide for the edu<Col N="1707" /> cation of the children in accordance with the O'Donoghue and Sinnott judgments. I am fully aware of the issue to which the Deputy refers and I am most anxious that this matter be resolved as speedily as possible. I have met with the parents involved and am aware of their concerns in relation to the matter. The issues involved have been the subject of high level discussions between my Department and the Department of Health and Children. Arising from these discussions, a senior member of my Department's inspectorate and a representative of the Department of Health and Children were appointed to visit the centre to review the situation and assist local management in resolving the current difficulty. The officials in question have already had discussions with the parents, staff and management at the centre. In addition, an experienced independent facilitator has been working with the parties in an effort to resolve matters. The report of the facilitator is due within days and I am hopeful that it will provide a basis for resolving the current difficulty.</P>
      <P>Adequate resources have been made available to ensure the delivery to the required level of both education and health care services at the centre. Responsibility for ensuring that the various inputs are delivered in a co-ordinated manner rests with the local management authorities. The guiding principle informing such arrangements must be that the needs of the children are paramount and that they require and are entitled to a multi-disciplinary response involving education and health care services. In this regard, the education and health care professionals assigned to work with the children need to make appropriate arrangements to meet the specific needs of each of the children. I am hopeful that the report of the facilitator will provide a basis for resolving the current difficulties at St. Vincent's to the satisfaction of all concerned, particularly the parents of the children involved. I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to supporting any measures which contribute to this objective and I call on all the parties involved to work towards this goal.</P>

      <P>An extension project has recently been completed at St. Mary's college, Naas, County Kildare, which will cater for an enrolment of 800 pupils. Since the completion of the extension there is no separate prefabricated building at the school. The school authorities have submitted an application for further additional accommodation at the school and, in this regard, the planning section of my Department has agreed a long-term enrolment of 900 pupils with the trustees. A decision relating to the project proceeding to architectural planning will be taken in the context of the capital allocation for the post primary building programme for 2003, existing commitments and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 to 127, inclusive, and 130 to 140, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My Department has an extensive primary school building programme for 2002 under way, details of which are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. Architectural planning has commenced for major building projects at the schools referred to by the Deputy except at St. Mary's special school, Athlumney, Dangan national school, Scoil Colmcille, Duleek, Scoil Cocha, Kilcock, Scoil Mhuire, Moynalty and Rathregan national school, Batterstown. In relation to Clonard national school and Meath Hill national school, my Department has recently grant-aided significant refurbishment works at these schools. My Department has also made proposals to both Moynalvey national school and Bellewstown national school to enable them undertake improvement works.</P>
      <P>In view of the extensive nature of the building programme, my Department has no plans at present to initiate architectural planning for any further major projects in the foreseeable future. Decisions on projects that are in architectural planning proceeding to tender and construction in 2003 will be taken in light of the allocations made for school building purposes and when all budgetary decisions have been taken by the Government. In the meantime, boards of management should use their devolved grants to ensure that essential health and safety issues at their schools are attended to.</P>

      <P>Children with special educational needs may transfer from special schools to special classes attached to ordinary primary schools or to ordinary classes where they may attend on a fully integrated basis with the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant service. In considering such transfers, it is important to have regard to the professionally assessed needs of the child involved and his or her capacity to function successfully in the more integrated setting. My Department is considering the issue of dual enrolment in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy and how this might be accommodated in terms of resourcing the two schools involved for the period of the child's attendance.</P>

      <Quest>the benefits which will accrue to the economy, to the Exchequer or to the consumer from the sale of the output of a company (details supplied) from the Seven Heads gas field to Innogy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the Seven Heads gas field be fully developed and produce gas, for which my approval has yet to be sought and given, there should be a number of benefits from the sales of the gas. One of the benefits to the economy will arise from the enhanced security of supply of gas reducing reliance on imports. According to the developers, the field has the potential to supply 10% of Ireland's current gas demand for at least five to seven years. Other benefits will accrue from the prolongation of the use of the Kinsale platforms in so far as the developers of the Seven Heads field propose to use the existing transmission and processing facilities.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it will prolong the economic life of the Kinsale field. Ultimately, this will have the effect of protecting both the jobs on the platform and in Marathon's head office resulting in prolonged payments of income tax to the Exchequer by those employees as well as corporation tax at the rate of 25% being paid by Marathon in respect of the profits accruing to the company from the provision of these services. The main benefits to the Exchequer will be the resultant increases in income tax from increased number of jobs created in connection with the project, rental fees for the rental of the leasehold area and corporation tax in respect of the profits from the sale of gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the presence of Innogy as a new player in the Irish gas market should have the effect of increasing competition among gas suppliers and in turn be of benefit to consumers by exerting downward pressure on price. While the availability of a new indigenous source of gas will enhance security of supply by reducing reliance on imports, the wider economic effects have not yet been assessed. It must be borne in mind that reducing gas flows through the interconnector <Col N="1714" /> system with Scotland can lead to increased transmission tariffs with consequent negative implications. The Commission for Energy Regulation will be undertaking a general review of gas transmission tariffs over the coming months.</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann has obtained statutory consent to construct the Mayo-Galway pipeline which will link the planned Enterprise Energy Ireland terminal at Bellanboy, County Mayo, with the national ringmain in County Galway. Bord Gáis Éireann has advised me that it is awaiting An Bord Pleanála's decision on the terminal before proceeding with construction of the pipeline. An Bord Pleanála will reopen the oral hearing on the matter on 25 November. I understand a decision is not expected until some time in 2003. I also understand that should the developers of the Corrib gas field receive a favourable determination they would hope to bring the gas ashore by early 2005.</P>
      <P>The Government has considered a number of options for further extending the gas network into the north west, all of which would require very substantial grant aid, in excess of 85%. The Government decided, in principle, that the network should be extended to Sligo via Ballina from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny from the planned Belfast-Derry pipeline. The Government agreed that it wished to have detailed costings for the extensions before making a decision to commit Exchequer funding to the projects and that, in the event of funding being made available, the projects should be put out to tender.</P>
      <P>My Department is pursuing the question of establishing detailed costings for the extensions in conjunction with the Commission for Energy Regulation. Following this it will be a matter for the Government to decide whether and how much funding is to be allocated. Clearly the proposed spurline extension to Sligo via Ballina is dependent on the Mayo-Galway pipeline being completed.</P>

      <P>I am currently finalising the national health information strategy which I intend to launch very shortly. This strategy will pave the way for the full exploitation of all aspects of health information and for the implementation of a wide range of electronic exchanges of information services within and between the community of health service providers and with the public. A significantly enhanced information technology infrastructure will be required to underpin these developments. These developments will lead to better delivery of health services and will facilitate better management of the health services at all levels.</P>

      <P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy, more than &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This level of investment far exceeds the £25 million requirement which was initially envisaged under the national cancer strategy. Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, an additional sum of &euro;29 million is being allocated in 2003 for cancer services, including cancer services in the South-Eastern Health Board area. This investment will ensure that next year we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services. Decisions in relation to the allocation of this funding between health boards will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national cancer strategy, 2003, is being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children and will set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.</P>

      <P>In addition to the development of new or enhanced service provision, my Department has been working with the health boards and voluntary service providers in recent years to meet specific identified needs in existing services. These primarily relate to the changing profile of the population in these services and in particular increased dependency levels due to ageing, medical frailty or challenging behaviour. The mechanism used is that following a review process, agreement is reached with the agency and the relevant health board in relation to the identified level of need. This is the process which has been followed in the case of the agency referred to by the Deputy. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot, at this stage, comment on specific funding for any element of the health services in 2003 prior to the conclusion of the annual budget discussions.</P>

      <P>With my colleagues, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey and Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Lenihan, I met representatives of the parents. Officials from my Department have been in contact with the management of the centre. Local management has been endeavouring to resolve the difficulties and this process is ongoing. It was agreed that the two Departments would nominate two people with relevant professional experience in this area to provide whatever assistance they can to local management in the matter. The two people nominated by the Departments met representatives of the families and other relevant parties. As part of the internal process to resolve the difficulties which have arisen in the services, a facilitator was appointed by local management and an internal working group established to work with the various professionals with a view to reaching a resolution in these matters. This process is nearing completion and I understand the facilitator's report is due shortly.</P>

      <P>A medical card may be granted to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, are unable to provide medical services for themselves and their dependants. Accordingly, my Department has referred this matter to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority for investigation and for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In 1984, the Government published Planning for the Future, the report of a study group set up to examine the psychiatric services. The report recommended <Col N="1726" /> that psychiatric care should be primarily community oriented, and that there should be a shift away from the psychiatric hospital being the focal point of the service. Successive Governments have supported this policy and the shift in mental health care from the institutional to a community based setting has resulted in many improvements.</P>
      <P>There are now 18 acute psychiatric units operating in general hospitals, replacing Victorian admission units. A further three units will become available to their respective mental health services in the near future, two units are under construction and several others are at various stages of planning. In relation to community residences, there are approximately 400 community psychiatric residences in the country providing over 3,000 places.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to continue the growth in alternatives to hospitalisation with the further development of community based services throughout the country. Additional revenue funding of &euro;10.473 million was allocated in 2002 toward his further development of community based mental health services primarily for the establishment of additional multidisciplinary teams. The recently published health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, includes a commitment to prepare a new national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document.</P>

      <P>The national physical and sensory disability database is currently being rolled out nationally, following its launch last March. To date data on 14,165 individuals has been registered on the database. This figure represents just over 34% of the projected figures of 41,250 individuals for the database, based on those registered during phase one of the roll out of the database. However, it is noteworthy that some health boards have indicated that the final figures registered on the database may be lower than originally estimated. It is also worth noting that data collection has not yet commenced in either the Northern Area Health Board or the East Coast Area Health Board. Following is a summary containing the latest available statistics in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the fluoride forum report did not examine studies from many countries which showed no real increase in dental caries in areas where water fluoridation had been discontinued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23169/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation here attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Public Health Service and the United States Surgeon General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these endorsements, I decided to establish the forum on fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was recently launched and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure, subject to the recommendations of the forum. The forum also concluded that: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; the best available and <Col N="1728" /> most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at 1 part per million, human health is not adversely affected; dental fluorosis, a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel, is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research.</P>
    <P>The forum's report emerged from 14 plenary meetings, several meetings of subgroups and oral presentations of material from both proponents and opponents of fluoridation. The forum invited the public to forward their views and examined more than 1,000 submissions. The forum took a participatory and evidence based approach striving to ensure balance between participants from both sides of the debate on water fluoridation. Despite several invitations to do so, it is regrettable that Voice declined to participate in the work of the forum. Many of the issues raised in its critique are the subject of ongoing research as outlined in chapter 14 of the forum on fluoridation.</P>
    <P>The report of the fluoridation forum made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. Following publication of the report, I have asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum. This expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride going forward. In par<Col N="1729" /> ticular, ongoing research related to fluoride will continue to be evaluated by the expert body and expanded to deal with new emerging issues.</P>
    <P>Information is already available in published literature about the effects of withdrawing water fluoridation from community water supplies and the effects differ depending on local circumstances. For example, in areas of Scotland and Wales where water fluoridation was discontinued, there was an increase in dental decay. The culture and dietary patterns in these regions are similar to those experienced in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In Finland the outcome and circumstances were different. Finland already had an alternative fluoride supplementation programme and a comprehensive preventive programme in place before withdrawing water fluoridation. There was also widespread substitution of xylitol instead of sugar in the diet. In these circumstances, Finland did not experience a rise in levels of dental decay. Finally, the fluoridation forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and was circulated to each member of the House. It has also been placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the availability of complementary and alternative medicines. My Department is not seeking to restrict availability of these medicinal products, other than in cases where there may be overriding public health considerations. On the contrary, to seek to ensure the continued availability of such products that are of appropriate quality and safety, my Department is currently examining proposals from the Irish Medicines Board for the control of these products, the aim of which is to provide the consumer with an assurance that the traditional medicinal products which they buy are produced to an appropriate quality standard, are safe under the recommended conditions of use, can be expected to be effective in the context of their established tradition of use and are appropriately labelled.</P>
      <P>To gain the most from these types of medicinal products, it is essential that they be controlled by an appropriate authority to ensure that, like all other medicinal products, they are of an appropriate quality and safe for the consumer to use. The interests of public health can best be realised when there is a formal mechanism for the assessment of these products and a subsequent means of monitoring their use in order to assure their continued safety in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that a proposed EU directive on traditional herbal medicinal products <Col N="1730" /> was agreed by the European Commission on 17 January 2002. This proposal has now been sent to the European Parliament and Council. I understand the Irish Medicines Board's proposal for an interim national control scheme for these products is broadly in line with the proposed EU directive. Both the Irish Medicines Board's proposal and the proposed EU directive are currently being examined in my Department. I have also received a number of representations from various interested parties, including members of the public, all of which will be considered in the context of our ongoing examination of the IMB proposed scheme of control and the proposed EU directive.</P>

      <P>The proportion of illness which is either directly or indirectly due to stress is not known. National statistics record, for example, detailed diagnosis data for episodes of hospitalisation but it is not possible to ascertain the extent to which stress may have been a contributory factor in the onset for each particular illness. Defining types of stress and levels of stress is complex and determining a causal relationship between stress and medical conditions poses further difficulties. Nevertheless, it is clear that high levels of stress have an adverse affect on health.</P>
      <P>A number of studies at European Union level have provided measures of self-assessed levels of stress. In 1999, the Eurobarometer survey reported a figure of 39.1% for the percentage of people regularly feeling stressed. The corresponding figure for Ireland was 36.4%. The EUROSTAT labour force survey for 1998-99 included findings on work related health problems which indicated 1.2% of those surveyed reporting stress, anxiety or depression related problems at work. Of these, 38% reported absences from work of two weeks or more in the preceding 12 months due to these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential for stress to be a contributory factor in cardiovascular conditions is recognised, particularly in conjunction with other pre-disposing factors such as smoking, obesity and excess alcohol intake. In the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy, funds have been allocated to develop or expand cardiac rehabilitation services in hospitals and to establish the first phase of the secondary prevention project in general practice. These services help patients and their families to cope with the illness as well as reducing the risk of a future event. As set out in the health strategy, the heart health task force is carrying out a mid-term review of the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy which will include a review of the available data on mor<Col N="1731" /> bidity and mortality from coronary heart disease. The review will be completed by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has informed my Department that, as part of its normal work in line with the cancer strategy, it is reviewing cancer services, including staffing, facilities, activity protocols and safety standards. As part of its ongoing work, the ERHA liaises with oncologists across the region in conjunction with their respective hospitals on these issues. This work is not and was never about capping budgets for cancer treatments. Its objective is to ensure cancer patients in the eastern region have access to the most modern effective drug treatments.</P>
      <P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, more than &euro;103 million has been invested to date in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Cancer services throughout the country have benefited from this investment which far exceeds the £25 million requirement which was initially envisaged under the national cancer strategy. Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff. Since November 2001, this Government has invested &euro;3.5 million in the development of cancer clinical trials, ensuring cancer patients in Ireland have access to the most modern and effective drug therapies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, an additional sum of &euro;29 million is being allocated in 2003 for cancer services. This investment will ensure that next year we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services, including oncology drug treatments. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy, 2003, is being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children and will set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. As part of this work, the National Cancer Forum has established <Col N="1732" /> a number of multidisciplinary subgroups, including a subgroup on evidence based medicine. This group is currently preparing a framework for the development, implementation, monitoring and updating of guidelines for the treatment of patients with cancer. The recommendations of these subgroups will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy, 2003.</P>

      <P>The pre-budget Estimates announced this day last week showed an increase of &euro;694 million in health spending. This means that total spend in 2003 will be &euro;8.9 billion, including capital spending. The increase in current spending is 9%, year on year. This is again a significant level of funding approved by Government and when combined with the base funding available provides a very solid funding platform for the delivery of services.</P>
      <P>Therefore, this funding level will provide for, among other things, the completion of the additional 709 beds in acute hospitals with an investment of &euro;118 million over the two years 2002 to 2003. The Estimates have also provided &euro;31 million for the treatment purchase fund, which will ensure that more than 7,000 people on waiting lists will be treated in 2003. This is in addition to &euro;43 million for the waiting list initiative. An additional sum of &euro;29 million for cancer services will ensure that in 2003 we can continue to address increasing demands for these services. In other areas significant additional funding has been provided for disability services, child care, services for older people and the development of primary care. Capital funding of &euro;514 million, up from &euro;497 in 2002, is being provided to further improve the health infrastructure and will be directed at 15 major projects countrywide.</P>
      <P>Balanced against this strong investment in service levels, I have decided to restructure the drugs payment scheme, the cost of which has risen by 40% since 2000. This restructuring will involve an increase in the threshold. In addition, the increased cost of the GMS scheme means that additional funding is not available for the extension of medical cards. However, management consultants have been appointed to examine the scheme, including increased drugs costs. It has also been necessary to increase charges raised by public hospitals for private beds which will generate additional income for hospitals of &euro;15 million. However, the cost of providing services to private patients in public hospitals is greater than the income generated and it is Government policy to gradually eliminate the subsidy, in the interests of equity.</P>

      <P>My Department has been informed by the national cancer registry that there is no information available on the number of cancer cases for any year prior to 1994. From 1994 to 1999 malignant cancer cases have increased by 1.2% per annum for women and 0.7% per annum for men. This increase is almost entirely attributable to population growth and ageing, with little evidence for any change in underlying cancer risk.</P>
      <P>Since the implementation of the strategy commenced in 1997 over &euro;103 million has been invested to date in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer.

This is a significant level of funding approved by Government and when combined with the base funding available provides a solid funding platform for the delivery of services.</P>

Capital funding of &euro;514 million is being provided to further improve the health infrastructure and will be directed at 15 major projects countrywide.</P>
      <P>Hospitals accept patients through their accident and emergency departments. The admission of elective patients is dependant on bed availability and the throughput of the A&amp;E departments.</P>
      <P>It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods. Bed closures may result from ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff shortages and as a consequence of infection control measures.</P>
      <P>One of the guiding principles behind the health strategy is to ensure equitable access to services based on need. My Department is committed to the reform of acute hospitals in order to improve access for public patients. These reforms include increasing bed capacity by 3,000 over the period to 2011, of which 272 have already been introduced to date and in excess of 600 beds will be in place by the end of the year. All of these extra beds will be designated for public patients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>The agreement of staffing levels in the health services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance who negotiate posts with the Department through the service planning process. The number of surgical, medical and nursing staff has risen significantly over the past few years. The total number of non-consultant hospital doctors increased from 2,775 in 1999 to 3,908 in 2002, a 41% increase in four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corresponding increase in the greater Dublin area, under the Eastern Regional Health Authority, was from 1,377 in 1999 to 1,886 in 2002, a raise of 37%. The current number of hospital consultants stands at 1,698, a 22% increase on the 1999 figure of 1,388, while the corresponding percentage increase in the ERHA is 19%. This is well in excess of the number <Col N="1736" /> recommended by the Tierney report on consultant staffing which proposed a staffing complement of 1,500 by the year 2003.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a number of measures to estimate the number of doctors and nurses required by our hospital service over the next decade and beyond. In relation to the numbers of hospital doctors the Deputy will be aware that I established a national task force on medical staffing earlier this year. The task force is, among other issues, considering the proposed development of a consultant provided public hospital service and quantifying the resource and cost implications involved. It is also addressing the reduction in working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors arising from the EU directive on working time and the medical education and training requirements of our hospital medical workforce. The task force will also address the associated medical staffing needs of the hospital system. It will consider the medical education and training requirements arising from any changes to the current model of delivering services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the level of nursing vacancies, the quarterly health service employers agency national survey shows the following number of vacancies at quarterly intervals since January 2001:</P>

    <P>This table shows that the number of vacancies has decreased by 267 since January 2001. This represents a 20.3% reduction in vacancies. The vacancy rate, at 3% of total nurses, is very low. Some level of vacancies is to be expected given that there will be retirements and movements in and out of the system on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The professional development of nursing and midwifery are a priority for my Department. A significant number of recruitment and retention initiatives have been introduced in recent years. Chief among these initiatives are the establishment of the commission on nursing and ongoing implementation of its recommendations; introduction of a new nursing degree programme, supported by substantial capital and revenue funding; an increase of 58% in the number of student nurse places since 1999 to a total of 1,640 per annum at present; provision of financial supports for nurses and midwives seeking to develop their skills and careers through part-time degrees and specialist nursing courses; over 800 places are available on specialist nursing courses, including accident and emergency, coronary care, oncology; establishment of the national council for the professional development of nursing and midwifery, whose role it is to provide for the development of the profession; introduction of a career path in clinical specialism and the creation of 1,400 clinical specialist posts; establishment of nursing and midwifery planning and development units in health boards and the ERHA; recruitment of an additional 5,788 nurses since 1998, representing a 19% increase in the total number of nurses employed in the public health service; a new grade of senior staff nurse was introduced; and the number of promotional outlets for nurses has been increased substantially.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the range of measures outlined which I have taken in recent years, as evidenced by the figures quoted, are having the desired effect on recruitment and retention of nurses. I am confident that the continuing application of these measures will provide the health service with quality nurses and midwives going into the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to other staff, the introduction of integrated workforce planning on a national basis in the health service is a priority under the health strategy. Under action 100 of the strategy my Department will lead the development of an integrated system of workforce planning. We will work closely with the health services skills group, established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to help identify ways of meeting the workforce requirements of the health system.</P>
    <P>Integrated workforce planning will build on existing initiatives and available data regarding workforce needs. It is aimed at anticipating the <Col N="1737" /> number and type of staff required to provide a quality health service.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the process will align workforce planning with strategic objectives and the service planning process undertaken in health boards; promote the use of skill mix, facilitating those in support roles to upgrade their skills and enabling specialists to focus on core functions; and involve integration with education, training and professional bodies in order to ensure that numbers of training places match the demand for skills within the health sector.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970 determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. The guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>Persons suffering from specified conditions, including acute leukaemia, who are not already medical card holders may obtain, without charge, drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme. There are no plans at this time to amend this scheme to include persons with other forms of cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy over &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Since 1997 approval has issued for 80 additional consultant posts with support staff. An additional sum of &euro;29 million is being allocated in 2003 for cancer ser<Col N="1740" /> vices. This investment will ensure that next year we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.</P>
    <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Amongst the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, particularly children with a disability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment and the maintenance of orthodontic waiting list data is the responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the number of cases awaiting treatment is a function of a number of factors, not least of which is the increased number of cases in orthodontic treatment as a result of augmented activity levels in the regional orthodontic units.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the September quarter there were 18,511 cases receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service of the health boards-authority. This is an increase of 1,216 in comparison with the equivalent figure at the end of the December 2001 quarter. This increased activity level is primarily due to the broad range of measures that I have introduced into the orthodontic service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to secondary care orthodontic <Col N="1741" /> treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. Cases assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care; cases assessed as category B have less severe problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available in terms of qualified staff in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. It is widely recognised that decisions made in the private sector regarding orthodontic treatment are based primarily on subjective need and are not based on any evidence linking the orthodontic condition to any aspect of dental ill health. On the other hand decisions made in health boards are based on prioritised guidelines ensuring that cases are selected for treatment based on the objective severity of the condition.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis and further increase the number of cases in orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service. Ultimately it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</P>
    <P>This year my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</P>
    <P>The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions.</P>
    <P>These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic <Col N="1742" /> therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>In the short-term I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. Furthermore, as part of this initiative, health boards are validating their orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Last June my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</P>
    <P>My Department does not routinely collect the data requested by the Deputy. Therefore, it has asked the health boards-authority to furnish the data directly to the Deputy, where available.</P>

    <P>In addition, two additional consultant orthodontic posts have been approved for the SHB and one additional post for the ERHA. There is a full-time vacancy in the NWHB area which is currently being filled on a part-time basis. Therefore, a total of 13 consultant orthodontic posts were approved for the health boards-authority by my Department. The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me that in <Col N="1744" /> 1999 there were seven consultant orthodontists employed by the health boards.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers have further informed me that at the end of the September 2002 Quarter there were 18,511 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,216 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <Quest>the current or intended status of the ten year health strategy programme announced before the general election; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23190/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2001 I launched a comprehensive strategic plan for the health system. The national health strategy has been widely welcomed for the consultation process involved in devising it, its comprehensiveness, its long-term outlook and its inbuilt flexibility to allow for local ownership and environmental changes over its lifetime. This is the essence of a good strategic plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a seven to ten year plan and several key actions will take the ten years to implement, for example, the primary care strategy. The action plan and target dates enable systematic monitoring of progress in the achievement of the type of world class health system envisaged. At the reconvened national consultative forum held on 11 November I outlined, with the help of Department officials and senior health board staff, a detailed inventory of investment and the associ<Col N="1748" /> ated service developments and changes in practice which have emerged in the past year in line with the new strategic direction. I will report to the Cabinet committee on the health strategy very shortly.</P>
    <P>Many of the actions which are front loaded in the strategy's action plan are concerned with detailed policy development or review for specific care areas. They also show a strong early start on the investment programme necessary to reconfigure our capacity around primary care and community services while ensuring that there is greater equity in the provision of acute hospital services. A strong showing has already been made in this regard with additional funding for the acute and primary care sectors in 2002 as well as significant investment in services for older people, mental health and disability services in particular.</P>
    <P>The following provisions have been made in 2003: &euro;53 million for bed capacity; &euro;31 million for the treatment purchase fund; &euro;29 million for cancer services; &euro;4.5 million for heart lung programme; &euro;43 million for the waiting list initiative; &euro;25.7 million for acute hospitals pressures; and &euro;10 million for the ongoing development of the <Col N="1749" /> primary care model and GP co-operatives. There is also additional funding for mental health, disabilities, older people and children's services. It must be remembered that this is on top of the biggest increases in health expenditure in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The strategy acknowledges the need to change, improve and develop certain aspects of the way the system operates. Almost 50 actions in the action plan for the strategy are concerned with the reform agenda. Achievements of a great many of these reforms do not require funding &ndash; they require a re-engineering of existing processes to focus on the new priorities and to focus more on the patient and client as being at the centre of the care process. I expect these targets will be met. Never has the need for maximum efficiency, value for money and accountability been more acute. These concepts are well embedded into the philosophy and practical actions of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Work is under way to ensure that strategic and service planning is in place at regional and organisational levels. This means that service plans have the strategy's goals and objectives fully embedded as part of the everyday routine of health service delivery. The implementation of the strategy is not a parallel stream of activity &ndash; it is the way business will be conducted in the system from now on. The development of processes to fully capture, monitor and evaluate system improvement and change through the planning process are also under way. Other organisational reform, such as the establishment of the health board's executive, also provide renewed focus to the efficiencies and improved consistency across the system to be gained from conjoint working.</P>
    <P>There remains a big agenda. Key initiatives which will inform and advance the reform agenda include the ongoing work of the consultants working on the audit of structures and functions of the health system. I have already described the purpose and scope of the audit to the House in some detail. The audit is now well under way and has just entered its consultative phase. Its primary focus is to establish the organisational improvements needed to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and growth, modernisation and reform set out in the quality and fairness strategy document. A report is expected very early in the new year.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that implementation of the strategy involves challenges for everyone in the health system. Its implementation must be underpinned by strong management of our economy. That is our best guarantee that the health strategy will be delivered on.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental committee was established in 2001, under the chairmanship of my Department, with the remit of bringing forward options for the development of rural public transport policy.

      <P>My Department has made compensation payments to all sheep farmers with commonage in the six western counties, who are not in REPS, who have suffered losses as a result of the 30% destocking in 1998. According to information provided by the Department of Agriculture and Food the son of the person named entered REPS in August 1998 and, therefore, would not have been required to destock under the interim framework plan. The quota was transferred to the person in May of this year but there has never been any quota frozen by the Department of Agriculture and Food. Therefore the full ewe premium entitlement is available to the person. Accordingly, the person is not entitled to compensation from my Department.</P>

      <P>The local authorities' mortgage protection plan has applied, subject to the terms of the plan, to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities on or after 1 July 1986. The terms of the cover under the mortgage protection plan were initially negotiated by a sub-committee of the County and City Managers Association, the Housing Finance Agency and a representative of my Department and are renegotiated periodically by the committee. The cost of the mortgage protection plan is met by way of an additional charge, currently 0.67%, to the rate of interest charged on individual loans and this rate is guaranteed until 31 March 2003.</P>
      <P>The current mortgage protection plan is underwritten by Hibernian Life and to ensure continuation of the scheme at the current competitive pricing structure it has recently sought information in relation to the age profile of a random sample of over 2,000 existing borrowers.

      <P>It has been the practice to review entrance charges to certain national monuments and other properties managed by my Department every two years and in the latter part of the year preceding the new charging regime. Charges for 2003-04 will be published shortly in line with this approach. However, I accept the rationale for earlier notification of planned new changes. I have, therefore, instructed that in future price reviews should be completed by the mid-year preceding the year to which the charges will apply.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property. For the purposes of assessing the value of capital and property a notional assessment method is used. The use of the notional method avoids the necessity of frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuate or whenever capital is moved from one investment option into another.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 2000 provided for the introduction of a new assessment method for capital and property which came into effect in October of that year. This new method applies to all social assistance schemes, other than supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>Under this method, the first &euro;12,697.38, £10,000, of capital is disregarded; capital between &euro;12,697.38, £10,000, and &euro;25,394.76, £20,000, is assessed on the basis of &euro;1.27, £1, weekly means for each &euro;1,269.74, £1,000, of capital; capital between &euro;25,394.76, £20,000, and &euro;38,092.14, £30,000, is assessed on the basis of &euro;2.54, £2, weekly means for each &euro;1,269.74, £1,000, of capital; and capital above &euro;38,092.14, £30,000, is assessed on the basis of &euro;5.08, £4 weekly means for each &euro;1,269.74, £1,000, of capital. These revised arrangements considerably benefited both single and married old age non-contributory pensioners by up to &euro;27.93 per week in the case of single pensioners and &euro;41.90 per week in the case of married pensioners.</P>
      <P>Currently, assuming that persons have no other means, a single pensioner with capital of up to &euro;20,315.80 will qualify for a full pension while single pensioners with capital of up to &euro;63,486.89 will qualify for a minimum pension. The equivalent figures for married pensioners are &euro;40,631.61 and &euro;126,973.80, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effective rate of assessment of capital depends on the level of capital: for example, it is less than 3% for a pensioner couple with savings up to &euro;25,000, and less than 4% for a pensioner couple with savings up to &euro;63,000. This new system continues the policy of ensuring that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs. Any changes to the current method of assessment of capital <Col N="1759" /> and property would have significant financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back-to-work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to assist the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force at a time when the overall unemployment level was 15.7% and long-term unemployment stood at 8.9%. By 2001 overall unemployment had fallen to 3.7% and long-term unemployment to 1.2%.</P>
      <P>The numbers availing of the back to work scheme have been falling steadily in recent years due to the continued buoyancy of the labour market and the low levels of long-term unemployment. At present there are 25,623 participants in the scheme compared to 39,343 in October 2000 when the scheme reached its peak.</P>
      <P>My Department has examined the scheme following the recent Indecom report and in the light of current labour market conditions to ensure that is focused on the most vulnerable groups in our society. It has been decided, therefore, to restructure the scheme and in going forward the scheme will now only target those in most need in accessing the labour market, specifically the very long-term unemployed and other groups and provision has been made to allow for this. The range of measure necessary to do so will be outlined as part of the annual budgetary process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present to qualify for the back-to-work allowance, employee strand, applicants must be: <Col N="1760" /> aged 23 years over and be in receipt of, or have an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance at a weekly rate greater than &euro;50.79 per week, single person, and &euro;78.72 per week, married person, and have been unemployed for at least 15 months &ndash; 12 months if over 50 years of age &ndash; at the time of applying for the allowance; or be in receipt of one-parent family payment, disability allowance, blind person's pension, carer's allowance, invalidity pension or unemployability supplement for at least 15 months at the time of applying or be in receipt of disability benefit for three years or more. Participants heretofore on the scheme received support for three years at varying percentages of their weekly social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>To qualify for the back-to-work enterprise allowance participants must be: selling up a self-employment business which has been approved by a partnership company or a jobs facilitator and in receipt of one of the following payments for 12 months: unemployment benefit &ndash; assistance, one parent family payment, disability allowance, blind person's pension, farm assist, unemployability supplement, pre-retirement allowance invalidity pension or carer's allowance. Persons in receipt of disability benefit for three years or more also qualify.</P>
    <P>Participants retain varying percentages of their social welfare payment over a three or four year period. The scheme also provides a range of additional supports to the people involved.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. At present to qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, 156 days, and be at least 21 years of age, 18 years of age for people with disabilities, immediately prior to commencing the first year of an approved course of study.</P>
      <P>Successful applicants are paid a weekly allowance equivalent to maximum standard rate of the social welfare payment that qualified them for participation in the scheme. They also retain entitlement to secondary benefits and are paid an annual cost of education allowance of &euro;254.00 at the beginning of each academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme currently provides for payment to be made to persons between academic years and in many instances this is during the summer period when persons, who had been previously <Col N="1761" /> unemployed, often do find work opportunities either at home or abroad and undertake these. In view of the continued low level of unemployment, unemployed people participating in the scheme will be required to seek employment during the summer holiday period and funding under the scheme will be discontinued during that period. Where persons do not, or are unable, to find work during this period, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions they would be entitled to an unemployment payment.</P>
    <P>The scheme as outlined is focused on enhancing employability and job readiness. For this reason qualification in respect of postgraduate courses will be restricted.</P>

      <P>In assessing means for the purpose of rent supplement, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, all household income, including spouse's income, either in cash or in kind, must be taken into account. Certain sources of income can be disregarded for this purpose. A list of these is provided in the following statement. In addition, the standard means test has been eased in recent years so that, if a person or their spouse takes up part time employment, he or she can retain the first &euro;50 of their weekly earnings. The means test for scheme participants has been eased in recent years with income from back-to-work allowance and family income supplement being disregarded in assessing the household income level.</P>
      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full time employment. However, as the Deputy is aware, arrangements are in place to enable people taking up employment through approved employment schemes such as back to work and community employment to retain a proportion of their rent supplement subject to a weekly gross household income limit of &euro;317.43 and to certain other conditions. No changes in these arrangements have been provided for in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sources of income which are disregarded in the means test for rent or mortgage interest supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme: child benefit; foster care allowance; income from providing accommodation for students studying Irish in a Gaeltacht area under a scheme administered by the Minister for Community, Rural Development and Gaeltacht Affairs; domiciliary care allowance; actual income from property &ndash; investments, including with<Col N="1762" /> drawals from deposits; moneys received from certain charitable organisations; income from home help; casual employment; living alone allowance; over 80 allowance; higher education maintenance grants; blind welfare allowance; rehabilitation training allowance; mobility allowance; expenses paid to public representatives; travel and meal allowance payable to participants on CE, FÁS-VTOS schemes, equality payments.</P>

      <P>The lower earnings threshold for social insurance contributions is &euro;38 per week. Employees covered under classes A, B, C, D, E and H with reckonable earnings between &euro;38 and &euro;287 in any given week, are exempt from paying social insurance for that week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1764" />The employer portion of the class A contribution is payable at the lower rate of 7.8% on employee's weekly earnings up to a threshold of &euro;356. The higher rate of 10.05% applies to all employee's earnings in any week where the earnings exceed &euro;356.</P>
    <P>Self-employed people with an annual income greater than &euro;3,174 are liable to pay PRSI at 3% of all income, or &euro;253 per annum, whichever is the greater. The employee's portion of the social insurance contribution applies to reckonable cumulative annual earnings up to a ceiling of &euro;38,740 with effect from 1 January 2002. An upper limit does not apply in respect of the employer or self-employed social insurance contribution.</P>
    <P>The weekly non-cumulative PRSI-free allowance of &euro;127 applies to the employee's social insurance contributions in classes A, E and H in any week that reckonable earnings exceed &euro;287. For those in classes B, C and D with reckonable weekly earnings above the &euro;287 threshold, a PRSI-free allowance of &euro;26 applies.</P>
    <P>The calculations of receipts of the social insurance fund in 2003 are based on pre-budget macroeconomic projections provided by the Department of Finance and I understand that the Minister for Finance will be making these available at the time of the budget.</P>
