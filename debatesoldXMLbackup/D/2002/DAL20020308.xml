    <Title>Competition Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This upgrading of the legislation is desirable and will put in place something effective and consumer friendly. It will have real teeth and will adequately protect the consumer. I outlined the various areas where anti-competitive activity could have a major bearing on the quality of life of the business sector and I referred to electronic and print media etc. I pose the question again as to the degree to which monopolies exist here in those areas. To what extent will this new legislation be in a position to combat the development of monopolies which exist in both electronic and print media? There is a grave danger that we may become accustomed to thinking that they are induced by that type of development.</P>
      <P>The global economy and multinational corporations have power far and above that vested in national governments. Will the forthcoming authority be effective in dealing with anti-competitive activities that may originate outside the State but could have a negative impact on the business sector within the State or the consumer? I posed these questions the last day and I hope the Minister will be able to tell us today that we are doing what was originally intended when the idea of competition legislation was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Europe there is a considerable amount of competition legislation, some of which is effective and some of which is not put into operation. Some of it affects bodies or states of little influence and not the more powerful operators. I would like assurance that the authority will be capable of dealing with all eventualities and will have the resources required to do its job. I am particularly concerned about businesses that can be affected by predatory pricing and restrictive practices which could ultimately eliminate competition from the marketplace. That kind of competition can be beneficial to the consumer in the short-term but in the long-term it can be disastrous. An example of this is the availability of the corner shop or small grocer. The small business sector giving a service to the community, albeit perhaps at a higher price, provides competition. If these businesses are removed from the marketplace their competitors will be left with a monopoly. It is the oldest operational strategy in the <Col N="786" /> world. I am not sure that the proposals in this legislation are capable of dealing with this.</P>
    <P>As I also mentioned the last time we spoke about this, I am concerned about the growth of the quango, and it is necessary to repeat it today. I am concerned about quangos that are not accountable to the House. Every day we see the development, with the approval of this House and usually emanating from the Government, of some new organisation or body with powers which has no accountability to the House. They are barely accountable to the Minister. When the Minister is asked questions about these organisations in the House his reply is that he has no official responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I heard an amazing statement by a civil servant that the Oireachtas had passed legislation. As we know in this House, the Oireachtas gives its approval. The Government proposes and disposes of the legislation and the Oireachtas merely debates it afterwards. Oppositions, as we know, do not have the power to overturn legislation except when it brings about a general election. The thinking behind these proposals is genuine, but I am not certain that it will be as effective as we would like. I will give it my ambivalent blessing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of saying a few words about this Bill, which I regard as enormously important for the economic future of this country. It receives little or no coverage because its significance is not understood and public interest in it is negligible. This is in contrast with attitudes in the EU and in other member states, particularly with the interest taken in these matters in the USA where they see that the proper regulation of competition is vital to the economic well-being of the country. This Bill consolidates the existing legislation with quite a number of amendments with which, by and large, I agree. There are two main Acts in force here, both of which I introduced, the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, and the Competition Act, 1991. With the benefit of hindsight we can see that both of those Acts have defects, especially the 1991 Act. I recognised some of the mistakes and inadequacies at the time but I could get nothing better through. The reason was that at that time, and to a lesser extent at present, there was no public acceptance of the need for competition regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Activities have gone on here over several decades which were wrong and for which in other countries the perpetrators would have been imprisoned. However, here most people cannot see that anything is wrong. Some of these concerted practices and abuses of dominant position were so blatant, and at the same time so accepted, that they were carried out by semi-State bodies. When one or two lone voices, such as mine, raised queries about them we were looked at askance, as though we were cranks seeing crimes where no crime existed. It was assumed that a <Col N="787" /> semi-State body had every entitlement to abuse its dominant position. I remember drawing attention to some of the activities of Aer Lingus for which the company was fined a substantial sum by the Commission and saying that those who ran Aer Lingus would not only have received a fine if this had taken place in the USA, but would also have been sent to prison for quite a lengthy period. The reaction to that statement was one of laughter.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has been dragged into the real world by competition but there are others who have not and they continue to abuse their dominant positions. A good example of this is the ESB. It produces a monthly newsletter or magazine, ostensibly for its staff, called <i>Electrical Mail</i>, of which the main part is a justification of the extraordinarily backward-looking policies the board feels entitled to pursue, to the detriment of the people.</P>
    <P>There are many examples one can give of the value of competition, but the one I always use, because it is the clearest, is the example of airlines. The Minister for Transport introduced a Bill into this House in 1984 called the Air Transport Bill, 1984, which made it a criminal offence to compete in any way in relation to the sale of airline tickets. Any form of discount on the Aer Lingus, British Airways and Department cartel fare proposed by a travel agent or by a competing airline would have been a criminal offence. It was punishable by a fine of £100,000 and-or three years imprisonment. A serious attempt was made to get that Bill through this House.</P>
    <P>When I opposed the Bill &ndash; I was on my own in opposing it as I had the good fortune at that time to be an Independent in this House &ndash; I was derided as some sort of deranged person who wanted to introduce a curious, anomalous thing called competition. Members were asked to accept &ndash; the majority of them did so &ndash; that the health of the balance sheet of a State company, owned entirely by the taxpayers of the country, was more important than the health of the economy. That was a ridiculous proposition but it was accepted in the House and throughout the country as being good sense.</P>
    <P>Within two years of the introduction for the first time of competition between airlines, against the opposition of the Department and Aer Lingus, there were two million extra people coming to this country. We have more than trebled the number of tourists visiting because they can now get access to this country at reasonable cost. Air transport in Ireland is now looked on as a right for everybody, not just for the relatively rich, as it was then. It is extraordinary that the minimum fare between Dublin and London at that time was £208, decided by the State cartel of British Airways and Aer Lingus with the approval and connivance of the Department of Transport. Today, one can travel from Dublin to London for perhaps £20, sometimes even less. The minimum fare at that time from Shannon or <Col N="788" /> Cork to London was £240. Today one can travel for £20 or £25 and sometimes even less.</P>
    <P>Can anyone seriously suggest that to introduce competition at that time was wrong? Can anyone suggest that the defeat or heavy amendment of that Bill in 1984, taking out those clauses, was wrong? Should we still labour in a situation where a company that charged £207 for an ordinary flight to London would be fined £100,000 or get three years in jail? If that is so, Ryanair and its equals would face perhaps 50 years in jail for the temerity that they have in charging low fares today. The face of aviation in Europe has been changed by an Irish company that overcame these difficulties, and there are so many other areas where this can be done also for the benefit of the people, their economy and employment. However, we are very slow in undertaking that.</P>
    <P>The great defect of the 1991 Act &ndash; I recognised it at the time &ndash; was that it did not contain any means to impose criminal sanctions. I was innocent, naive and hopeful enough to think that it could be enforced by civil means, but that proved incorrect. Competition law can only be adequately enforced if it is done by a public regulatory authority, such as the Competition Authority or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It cannot be done 99% of the time by injured or damaged parties because of their nature &ndash; they are too small and they tend to be damaged by parties that are extremely big. As a result, they never take them on.</P>
    <P>The example in the immediate aftermath of the 1991 Act was that of small suppliers trying to supply the likes of Dunnes Stores and whatever Tesco was then called. No small supplier would take on Dunnes Stores as the company would simply blacklist the supplier and it would go out of business. I was wrong and the legislation was unrealistic, but I had a feeling that I was wrong at that time. I wanted to bring in criminal sanctions but I could not get the Cabinet to agree and, even if it had, I do not think I would have got the House to agree. That is because the House, like the public, could not see anything wrong with the abuse of a dominant position or in companies engaging in concerted practices to the detriment of the consumer.</P>
    <P>To a fair extent, that is still the case. It is a strange coincidence that in many towns in Ireland it happens that every publican on a particular morning wakes up and says, &ldquo;I will increase the price of the pint by 3p&rdquo;. As one publican thinks that beautiful thought, every one of the other 90 publicans in the same town thinks the same beautiful thought. They all implement it and it is a pure coincidence. We have seen this many times. In other countries, one would be jailed for doing a thing like that, but here it is called a stroke and is supposed to be commendable.</P>
    <P>Numerous practices of this kind continue, with the concrete industry being one that should be particularly looked into, from what I am told. I believe that the authorities have been slow to do that, for some reason.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" />The area where concentration of ownership is probably most dangerous is that of media ownership. This Bill contains provisions for changing the arrangements that exist in section 3 or 4 of the 1978 Act in relation to media ownership. I have no objection to changing those arrangements so long as the fundamental principle remains the same. I hope that is the case although it is a bit difficult to follow what exactly is proposed here.</P>
    <P>The 1978 Act was simple and clear and it meant that in any sector of economic activity where the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day thought that there was a special sensitivity about the concentration of ownership, he was entitled to make an order whereby the various thresholds did not apply. Therefore, any merger or take-over in such a sensitive sector would have to be notified to him and he would have to consent to it no matter how small the assets or the turnover involved. It was necessary to do that at that time because one man, who was then Mr. Anthony O'Reilly, owned 16 newspapers in this country. I thought that was enough and that he should not own any more. I put that section in the 1978 Act and as soon as it was passed, I made an order which is still in existence and which has worked very well. He has not been able to increase the number of newspapers he has taken over here. I understand he owns two new newspapers but they started up subsequently and, of course, the order did not apply to them. He has also acquired considerable media interests in relation to local television and the distribution of television, but I think that was outside the ken of the 1978 Act. As far as I can see, it is covered in this Bill, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>It is, however, vitally important that the Minister of the day has proper control over that situation. If that section had not been included in the 1978 Act and if the order I made the day after its passing had not been made and enforced ever since, there would probably be only one owner of newspapers in this country today. I understand the same gentleman has frequently loudly criticised me both in private and in public for having made that order so I fully realise the order was efficacious and desirable and I am glad it was made. This Bill should not weaken the position in relation to that and I hope it does not.</P>
    <P>I note from the Bill that the Minister gives over a lot of her powers to the Competition Authority, and I see why, but there should be some kind of residual reservation of powers to the Minister because, in the last resort, the Minister is responsible for competition policy and for the economic well-being of this country which is so dependent on competition policy and its enforcement. If I were the Minister, I would not give up all my powers. There is a reservation of some of the powers but she should consider perhaps more extensive reservation.</P>
    <P>I would like to take part in Committee Stage of this Bill but a nominal hour or two will be devoted to it at a committee of which I am not a <Col N="790" /> member. There will be no real discussion of it in this House and that is a pity because we had a useful discussion in 1978 and 1991 and it helped to clarify a lot of matters. However, with the dissolution of this Dáil being imminent, it is eminently desirable that this Bill pass and that the various provisions contained in it become law.</P>
    <P>On reading the explanatory memorandum, I see that a very high proportion of the recommendations of the review body which sat on this matter, the Competition and Mergers Review Group, have been implemented and I welcome that because there are a lot of review groups of that kind which have laboured in the wilderness for years and produced good reports which never really saw the light of legislative day. In this case, the recommendations are being implemented in legislation to a great extent. However, when I went through its various recommendations, I got the feeling that a lot of the recommendations were there for the convenience of practitioners perhaps and that at times they may lose sight of the fundamental economic necessities. A competition law is not an end in itself, it is purely the means to enforce broader economic policy, and sight should not be lost of that fact. There are now people who are specialists in competition law but they are there only to serve to the broader cause, the more fundamental and important cause. The convenience of practitioners and their clients should not be a paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>One of the weaknesses of the 1978 Act was that if somebody did not comply with it, there were very limited sanctions and limited consequences for non-compliance. Indeed, if someone ignored it completely, it was possible, in certain circumstances, to get away with that. I was recently reminded of that by a case which was widely reported in the newspapers, a case which never reached a conclusion because it was settled between the parties after it had been at hearing for, I think, 40 or 50 days. That case arose out of the Master Meats merger or take-over. It is now clear &ndash; it is no longer a question of opinion &ndash; that lies were told to the Department of Industry and Commerce at the time and to the Fair Trade Commission which I asked to investigate the matter and which was the predecessor, in a sense, of the Competition Authority. The person who told the lies admitted telling them. He said he was only admitting it was a lie for the purpose of the case which was going on recently. How it can be a lie one day and not the next I am not quite sure but I could not follow that man's reasoning in any event.</P>

      <P>I see. It is a pity I do not have the opportunity to deal with the Master Meats situation and the fact that the party who took over the group of companies concerned did not comply with the law and just thumbed his nose at it. It was impossible apparently for me or for any of my successors in that Department to do anything about it. As far as I can see, there is provision in this Bill whereby something can be done. There will be sanctions and I hope they will be retrospective in that respect.</P>
      <P>There are many more things I would like to say about this Bill which I regard as hugely important and I regret that I do not have the opportunity. I hope the Bill will pass before this House is dissolved and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it in because it will make a major contribution to the economic well-being of this country in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Malley, I welcome this Bill but I also decry the fact that it is being rushed through and that there will be limited time for Committee Stage. This is the end of a five year term and there were opportunities on previous occasions to bring it in, if there was commitment by the Minister and others to do that, and to give plenty of time to discuss it. It is very strange that the first point I was going to make was the one on which Deputy O'Malley finished, that is, the meat trade. The meat trade is an example of where competition raises more questions than gives answers. Deputy O'Malley said that publicans can find a way on the same day to up the price of a pint of stout, a glass of whiskey or whatever. Something similar exists in the meat trade. Regardless of what markets factories are involved in, they seem to be able to find a common price to give to farmers, and it is certainly not at a high level. There is a monopoly in the trade of dead meat. Although a relatively high price exists for Irish meat in Britain, the price paid by factories is decreasing. Last week, by admission of the farm organisations, farmers were not asking what price they could get for their cattle, rather they asked when their cattle could be killed. Those running the monopolies have effectively told farmers that they will have to live with the conditions they lay down and that nothing can be done about it.</P>
      <P>It is in light of this that I tried to question the Taoiseach yesterday about the Government's emphasis on the live trade and the whole issue of competition. When the Taoiseach and the Ministers, Deputy Walsh and Deputy Cowen, were on the Opposition benches just five years ago, they had all the answers. BSE was a problem at that time, let nobody say it was not, yet they said it was due to the failure of the then Government that all the live markets were not opened. If we are serious about competition &ndash; that is what Government is all about &ndash; we must make sure that every opportunity is afforded to those who want to be involved in primary production or primary purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" />We must look at the monopolies and question how the rules were dealt with. I hope this Bill will deal with the anomalies and difficulties that have existed in Departments over many years. Whenever meat factories were in trouble in the past, it seemed very strange that Larry Goodman was able to be there at the right time and place to buy them. Many years afterwards this House had to be recalled to stop that entire industry descending into chaos. This House had to take decisions to allow Mr. Goodman, trading as AIBP, continue in business. Maybe if questions had been dealt with in a proper way in the past, as Deputy O'Malley said, that crisis would not have occurred. I say this with some knowledge because I was a board member in the Cork Marts IMP group. I remember when the group got into some difficulties with the trade unions, it was said it was not able to compete because of the mismanagement of the farmers' organisations. There was no way we could prove otherwise because there was no independent or open-ended information about our opposition to establish if they were competing fairly.</P>
    <P>We have heard about shelf companies in this House in the past 24 hours and how a shelf company has been involved in the Taoiseach's pet project, the &ldquo;Bertie bowl&rdquo;. I remember that Cork Marts IMP was forced to sell its meat plants in Leixlip and Grand Canal Street. Even today people find it difficult to establish who actually bought those companies. Company names that we had not heard of before came from nowhere and bought these companies. I and those involved with me had no doubt that it was those in the meat industry who bought those plants to ensure that there would not be competition. It can be called mergers, underhand dealing or anything else, but the reality is that those plants were bought at rock bottom prices. Farmers' co-ops around the country were lambasted as being inefficient, unable to compete and incapable of doing business. Yet we were dealing with the same market where intervention was one of the mainstays and there was no question about the price many were getting for their cattle. Good people were put out of the industry.</P>
    <P>Only last night in this House, a former Minister of State questioned the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development about his activities. I remind people that that Minister, as a Minister of State in the former Department of Agriculture and Food, was involved with Larry Goodman and the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, in the launch of a so-called major industrial breakthrough in the form of a £2.5 million meat project. Nobody in the finance industry could advise me or knew anything about it when I made inquiries at the time. There are links and I make no apologies for bringing them up today. We need transparency and to be clear about who is involved in the purchase of companies, whether it is Larry Goodman, Tony O'Reilly or anybody else. I <Col N="793" /> hope this Bill has sufficient powers to ensure that.</P>
    <P>I have named Larry Goodman and I want to make it very clear that I have worked very closely with him and have nothing against him personally. Good luck to him if he has used the system. There must be major question marks over those who were in power at different times and in a different element of his industry that allowed the things that happened. Those things put a lot of pressure on the co-operative movement and those who had made efforts to create new wealth and structures. I think of the boning halls in particular in that young people's lives were committed to a new era in the meat industry. They did their best but found themselves overpowered by the great and the good. I hope the food industry can enter a new era.</P>
    <P>There is need for competition in the media. At local level we can see that local newspapers and radio stations who are independent of the major groups give a tremendous and unbiased service. The public are increasingly using those media. A Member will seldom hear it remarked that he or she was heard speak on national radio, but if one says something on local radio it will be remarked on by everyone. I hope that nothing will ever happen to the local radio stations and media to stop that. It is frightening that one man and one group can control the national media. I say that with some degree of trepidation because I know the power that some of those have. I remember the editorial of a newspaper being moved to the front page of a newspaper a few days before the last general election. That illustrates how far some people were prepared to use their power in the media to ensure that their personal, business or other interests were served. The new Competition Authority has a major role to play in ensuring that such behaviour does not occur and that transparency and democracy are allowed to function.</P>
    <P>I welcome without apology competition in other areas. Deputy O'Malley referred to monopolies in the past. One such was Roadstone, a very good company, but in my area we discovered that once the Border was opened thanks to the EU, the price of tar and stone chips, for example, fell dramatically. We could get it at a lower price in the Border region than in Wexford, Cork or elsewhere. Unfortunately no Government, of whatever hue, gave us the money to match that. If we had received an increase in Government money, we could have really benefited from lower prices. I am dismayed that at the present time when we are supposed to be benefiting from the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process generally, we are blocked from the advantages of competition because of the difficulties in this region.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the NRA which is an independent body, is responsible for this. I worry about all independent bodies, including the NRA and the Competition Authority, which are answerable to no one. Despite the fact that the <Col N="794" /> Border area is in the BMW region, designated by Brussels for special assistance, the NRA has not spent one brass farthing or euro &ndash; whatever one chooses to call it &ndash; on any of the by-passes on the major route that links the fourth biggest city on the island, Derry, with Dublin and would allow competition north and south of the Border. This is the time when we could benefit from progress, but we are not doing so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to competition in respect of supermarkets and small corner shops. I do not object to supermarkets which have opened up many areas and give a good service, but there must be an even playing field. First, I admit that I am a dairy farmer, should anyone question my motives, and supply liquid milk to the County Monaghan co-op, which has the best milk in the country. However, when that co-operative's milk is put in a supermarket, it is often sold as a loss leader. That milk cost much in feed, work and production, yet a bottle of water that comes out of the ground at minimal cost, is sold at a high price by the supermarket.</P>
    <P>I raise this issue in the context of small corner shops which are being squeezed out and receive no help from the Government. The often elderly people who run these shops cannot receive family income support as employees can. Like farmers' accounts their accounts are trusted, or mistrusted to be more accurate, and so they do not receive the little help that might enable them to stay in business and provide a local service. Competition is important but people must be protected.</P>
    <P>Another issue is that of competition in the banking sector. The National Irish Bank is owned by Australians, the Ulster Bank by Scots and the AIB by someone in the United States, or at least his share dealings have influenced it in recent months. It is credit unions, on the other hand, owned by the local people which give a real service to customers. Monopolies do not necessarily give the best service.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Sutherland led the way in opening up the EU to competition. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when I first went, it was extremely expensive to travel to Brussels, but that has changed dramatically thanks to his reforms which resulted in airlines genuinely competing. This has been of great benefit to industry and tourism in this country because people can travel here cheaply. However, internal travel would also benefit from competition. Independent operators find it hard to get licences for routes on which CIE has a monopoly. Likewise, in electricity generation, ESB's dominance is a problem. Again, it was the EU which insisted that this end, but we have a long way to go before we have real competition in these areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill has much to offer. The Tánaiste has been the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for over five years. She began with high ideals and hopes, promising inquiries and investigations. As I said before, however, I am disappointed that the Bill will not be debated properly but is being rushed through in the dying <Col N="795" /> days of the Government. After five years, there is only a smoke screen covering the activities of those inquiries when we want answers. About 18 months ago, we heard rumours. However, these create problems rather than solve them. I would like to see, in the last few weeks of the Dáil, openness, transparency and accountability from the Tánaiste. She must show us that this Bill will work and that she is serious about it delivering.</P>
    <P>As someone deeply involved in the co-operative sector, I say that big is not always beautiful. I am a shareholder in a small County Monaghan co-operative. Despite what was said in recent decades about only the big surviving in Europe, this small, efficiently and properly run co-op, like others, survives and there is a place for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, particularly on section 22. I know my good friend and colleague, Deputy Crawford, will forgive me if I say that I profoundly disagree with much of his concluding summary. By way of beginning, as I must use my time economically, I say that I do not subscribe to the view that Commissioner Sutherland ushered in a golden era in Europe or in multilateral trade, for reasons about which I can be specific. I read the Tánaiste's speech and the debate so far. It appears there are a number of assumptions at its base, some of which we will leave aside for an occasion when we have much more time. To put it mildly, it is based on the assumption that perfect competition is attainable and that we have true markets, as it were. It also assumes the benefit of consumers is met almost exclusively by the elimination of inefficiencies in competition and, therefore, everybody will be better off if we proceed along this exceedingly narrow furrow.</P>
      <P>Where it fails dramatically and significantly is in connecting the case for a Competition Authority to the wider society. When it comes to section 22 in relation to the media, it is unable to accept that work in a newspaper, radio, television or any other audio-visual or new technological usage is at once a cultural expression and is only partially a commodity. Yet it is precisely because it regards it as a commodity that it excludes the colleague Minister, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, almost completely from the Bill. I might say in relation to that matter which is reserved from the Competition Authority, on which the Minister will give an opinion, that there is not any requirement for consultation that would take account of the cultural significance of media work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine Members on the opposite side of the House would be able to remember the centrality of such an argument rather easily. One need only examine the sad, sorry and sordid history of the <i>Irish Press</i> in its last days and the way the livelihood of journalists and people who worked in a paper that had moved out from the spancel of a single vision to being a fine news<Col N="796" /> paper with features was destroyed near the end by a set of management decisions and manipulations in relation to financing. Was it not important that the <i>Irish Press</i> was to be no more? There is more involved than just the movement of the shares and who owned what or whatever. I am in favour of openness, transparency and accountability but I do not want to be told that we are on some automatic curve that will systematically handle questions such as concentration in ownership.</P>
    <P>I will make another point as we approach St. Patrick's Day when people will scatter themselves across the diaspora. The backbench group of the Tory party produced a document on cross-ownership and upper limits on ownership. It was explicit in what it wanted. Its members were not raving &ldquo;pinkos&rdquo;, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, might see it. They were backbench Tories and they said there should be an upper limit on what anyone in one branch of the media should own, and strict limits in relation to cross-ownership. I produced a Bill in that regard in this House. It was voted down.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister of State, who is a very affable man when he goes to the WTO talks and events like that, not disturbed that we are now entering a phase where the community of broadcasters in Europe, represented by the European Broadcasting Union, can be bid out of sporting rights by corporations like the Kirsch Corporation which can in turn be taken over by Rupert Murdoch's companies? The net effect of that is that the rights are then put on the market and the person who can pay the most will have exclusive rights to show soccer matches, the World Cup, which was probably the most dramatic bid, the Olympics and so on.</P>
    <P>The European Broadcasting Union worked on the basis that citizens in Europe were entitled to watch certain events on the basis that they were European citizens, and the charge made by the European Broadcasting Union was in relation to capacity to pay. That is entirely gone. The EBU is on its last legs, but what is very interesting is that there has not been a jot of evidence in five years that the Minister responsible for competition talks to the Minister with responsibility for culture and broadcasting about these issues.</P>
    <P>I was a Minister in this area and I recall the resistance I met from the Department with responsibility for competition, which appeared to be of the view that real men talk about competition and sissies talk about culture, even as it limited the right of readers in Ireland. It did nothing to include plurality in terms of editorial provision in the printing press here, as it does nothing in relation to radio and television. Its world is a &ldquo;commodified&rdquo; world, and I repeat my criticism of that great god, Peter Sutherland. His world was one in which commodities would move freely, but people did not move freely. He made his way, by a set of clever choices, through the European Union, the GATT and the World Trade Organisation and via Goldman Sachs, with a view of the <Col N="797" /> world that the only feature it needs to usher in a better world was to remove the State's competition.</P>
    <P>The good news coming from Europe was mentioned in the Minister of State's contribution, and is also referred to in the Bill, namely, that Commission Monti, who is responsible for competition, was asked more than once in the European Parliament by people across the board, a majority of European Union parliamentarians, to do something about the concentration of ownership that was emerging in the European Union. I was one of the culture Ministers who attended all the meetings of the Council of culture Ministers. The Commissioner with responsibility for culture was urged by the Ministers to put pressure on Commissioner Monti and on the President of the Commission to implement the European Parliament decision on monopoly of ownership in the media. In the end, Commissioner Monti said these matters are best left to the marketplace. He was supported in that by Jacques Delors.</P>
    <P>I will explain what they meant for people who are interested. The right to have editorial diversity in society is a right of communication as a citizen, and a citizen is not simply a consumer. A citizen is in part a consumer, and competition can deal with some things that deal with one's life as a consumer, but one is entitled to read diverse opinions. One is entitled to watch films and not know that 97% of them are made in a tiny place on the planet called Santa Monica. One is entitled to have a variety of radio and television production, yet there is not a single line in the Bill as to how the Government proposes to deal with those features of monopoly that are sourced in satellite technology.</P>
    <P>The competition regime is being breached every day by people who operate from a technology that is sourced outside of the jurisdiction. It is interesting to note also how much of this is being suggested as an inevitable and inescapable version of the future, that there is no other way and why would we interfere? It does matter and I will give an example in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who would have liked to have seen coverage of the conflict in Afghanistan from a fair perspective. I do not want to see narrow, isolated logos on my television set which read, &ldquo;Fighting Back&rdquo; or &ldquo;War on Terror&rdquo;, for months on end, which is a flagrant violation of all good production values in features and in television news. It is rather like the days of the landlord. The landlords in Ireland, particularly when they lived abroad and got on with their notions of gentility and manners, were supposed to be people who could not possibly be involved with oppression of the peasants. The agents could do that.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that we move towards concentrations of ownership in the media. There is such a distinction in the difference between the owner and the senior editorial staff that there is no possibility of interference. I do not accept that. The evidence is there. I could easily provide evi<Col N="798" /> dence of when particular events happen that nothing negative is portrayed while X is in town. That is all I will say on that matter in regard to one of the dominant groups in the Irish news media.</P>
    <P>I said all that to bring these matters together to help the Minister of State to give a me reply on this matter. Will he tell me what matters should not be solely ruled by a competition regime, in other words, where there should be a right of entry and a diversity of opinion? Can he tell me how this Bill will enable the senior Minister to consult the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on matters of media policy? Can he point to something that will ensure freedom of access to books, periodicals, radio and the media? Does he accept the EU directive? Does he accept the position in which the European Parliament has been ignored systematically by Commissioner Monti who has set his face against destroying State monopolies in the name of creating new totally unaccountable monopolies? </P>
    <P>I will give the Minister of State another example. When he raised questions about our film industry on one or two occasions, which were answered adequately and proved to have been entirely legal, he did not raise the question of why it is impossible to purchase a film made and put into circulation commercially in the United States which has been a box office success without buying five others in a basket. It did not seem to concern him that there is no country in the European Union or among any of the six applicant countries where less than 95% of US films are watched?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State realise that there is a great deal more to being in Ireland than being an Irish consumer? My story about the <i>Irish Press </i>and about the right to diversity in publication, print and broadcasting, the right to tell one's own story, the right to make music are all about being an Irish citizen. Everything that has come from Europe, everything that the former Commissioner Sutherland drove through Europe and everything that came out of the completed market was about being a European consumer. It was not about being a European citizen. People laugh at Eurocrats when they come out with this. Jacques Delors had two attacks of being a European citizen and wrote a few speeches on it. In the founding treaties of the European Union there is no reference to culture. Article 128.4 is the only reference in the Maastricht Treaty which states it should be taken into account. Does it matter then? I believe it does.</P>
    <P>Poorer citizens in Europe are entitled to have free to air access to matters that are significantly European irrespective of their right to pay. Is this not then the problem facing the Minister of State? He is talking about legislation for the perfection of markets and is working hard in regard to our hang-ups. When the Minister of State goes to Geneva to the WTO talks, the same thing happens.</P>
    <P>I pay credit to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is interested in the initiatives being <Col N="799" /> taken about the ILO. If he were to go from the ILO to the World Trade Organisation, which is only down the road, he would find there is not much interest regarding labour as a profoundly human activity or regarding the view that child labour is a disgrace, that multinationals who abuse it should be straightened out and action should be taken against them. He would be told that the WTO sees itself as something that regulates markets, apart from American production in relation to steel.</P>
    <P>I find one aspect of the Bill rather vague and the Minister of State might be able to clarify it. In relation to some proposed mergers, the authority will offer an opinion and make a recommendation, but in regard to the procedure when the Minister makes an order, with whom does the Minister consult? The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, have occasional differences of nuance, but the assumptions they have seem similar; they would like to give away the power altogether. In other words, one can give a technical body the authority to make a decision on a merger or to an approach towards monopoly. That would enable a Minister to say in this House that a certain matter has nothing to do with him or her.</P>
    <P>I wish to finish on a matter that is important to me, the role of the regulator, which is not very advanced in the Bill. David Byrne, now a Commissioner, in a seminal address to the Law Society of University College Dublin some years ago on the role of the regulator in Europe and the United States looked at weak and strong models on the role of the regulator. It led to the fundamental assumption that what the Minister gives away is a policy envelope. The Minister gives a policy envelope to the regulator and the Minister remains accountable for that policy envelope in the same way as the Government and Ministers are responsible for citizens, as they are for the market. What is given to the regulator is a clear set of ministerial and Government decisions and, therefore, that is technical. That can be made open and transparent, but the worst of all worlds in the worst of regulatory regimes is where a Minister seeks the excuse of the existence of the technical authority to avoid political accountability. Unfortunately, that is the dangerous road down which we have been going.</P>
    <P>We have not had a debate on competition, the matters that are not matters of competition, the matters of citizenship outside the market, the role of the regulator and particularly how the media and what is done in the media are not reducible to a commodity. It is only a Philistine outfit that would see it like that. It is rather like saying that art and culture matter much less than entertainment. Hucksters in the entertainment industry are the people who will be served by the competition regime. What is involved in relation to citizens living their lives fully requires much more. We should be looking at how the <i>Irish Press</i> came <Col N="800" /> to be wrecked and its background, and we should not repeat the exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few points about competition, the Competition Authority and the non-competitiveness route our country has gone in recent years. I do not agree with Deputy Higgins that the former Commissioner Sutherland was the cause of ensuring additional millions of people per year arrive here as a result of the deregulation of the airline industry. I heard Deputy O'Malley talk about what he did when he was Minister and what he proposed in relation to putting legislation through this House some years ago which helped in regard to that scenario. If the airlines that were providing the services were not able to compete, it meant there was a top heavy problem, and unfortunately that has been borne out as a result of the number of companies that have got into difficulties.</P>
      <P>Monopolies are developing here at an alarming rate, but the Government has done little, if anything, in the past five years to address this trend. Some of the monopolies are State owned and others are privately owned. There is a monopoly in the ESB. It deals with the consumer as if his or her inquiry does not matter and is likely to respond to the effect that it will deal with the matter in six months, eight months or whenever a proposed development takes place. That position has developed because the Government had no imagination to put in place an alternative source of energy and to put forward proposals on that.</P>
      <P>There are monopolies in the area of the production of cardboard. The Smurfit Group has become an international organisation. This is the beginning of a similar type situation with multinational waste disposal. What happens with these conglomerates is that one organisation produces all the packaging and repackaging while a second goes around the world and builds incinerators for which it charges substantial sums of money to get rid of the particular product being produced, half of which could be done without and half of which was done without in the past. At the end of the day, the consumer pays the price.</P>
      <P>I would like to think when the housewives of Ireland or those members of families who go shopping arrive at the supermarket cash desk, they would remove all the cardboard not required and leave it with the multinationals and the supermarkets to be disposed of. This would mean much less waste going to the dumps and recycling centres and lower costs at the end of the day. Shoppers should vote with their feet when faced with these scenarios.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to monopolies in the media. Apart from Rupert Murdoch in Britain, one of the biggest monopolies here is the Independent Newspaper group which owns in region of 70% to 80% of the print media. It is unethical from a fair play point of view that this should be the case. It was interesting to note the newspaper <Col N="801" /> headlines encouraging people to vote one way or the other within two days of the last general election. That was done because the then outgoing Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, refused to allow the group to purchase the press titles which would have given it another 10% of the titles of the print media in the country. There is nothing in the proposed Bill to say that an organisation, such as the Independent Newspaper group, should own such an amount of the print media. Neither is there any proposal to curtail its involvement. If it so wishes, it can go around the country and buy up other local newspapers. Some of these were sold recently and there is a possibility that more may be sold in the future. It is not fair that this should be the case. I object to the line adopted by this organisation, especially when one considers that its owner does not live in the country but wants to dictate the way things should happen. I listened to him on a few occasions at after-dinner speeches. All he is interested in is the bottom line and the profits, irrespective of the expense, and whichever Government will allow him to have a larger share of the titles.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time that CRH would have control of building materials and the roads infrastructure. Given that it has a monopoly, it is able to squeeze out the small competitor and this has happened on numerous occasions as a result of which there is no competition.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael came up with the idea of establishing the National Roads Authority, a so-called independent roads authority although I often ask of whom is it independent. It proposes to build a motorway from Clonee to north of Kells on the N3. The NRA was asked whether the Government had an opinion on a public private partnership and whether there should be a dual carriageway or a motorway. The authority favoured dual carriageways which it set out to provide on three different occasions in County Meath but, lo and behold, it subsequently proposed that the carriageway be improved to motorway standard and be tolled. Given that there are four tolled roads leading into and out of County Meath, the county will have the highest number of tolled roads in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Unlike Kildare and some other counties, there has not been any investment in dual carriageways in County Meath. Why should the National Roads Authority, supported by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Government, have a monopoly in relation to the provision of tolls? When the Minister was asked about this matter, about which he replied to Meath County Council no later than last Monday, he said, &ldquo;I have no direct input into the policy of the National Roads Authority&rdquo;. However, that morning on the radio he claimed the good news about the moneys allocated by the National Roads Authority for investment in roads in the county. On the one hand, the Executive says there is bad news involving the National Roads Authority and that it has no say in the matter <Col N="802" /> whereas if there is good news it wants to claim the credit. It is no wonder people are cynical about politicians.</P>
    <P>As my colleague has stated there is no competition in the meat industry in which we have witnessed the operation of a monopoly in recent years. A small number of operators in the industry have always had a monopoly while in many cases those producing the product are not properly paid.</P>
    <P>Given the controversy of the past week we cannot allow the occasion to pass without referring to another monopoly, the publicly owned semi-State company, An Post. God bless us. The taxpayers have provided it with substantial funds on a continual basis. The main party in Government has decided to put a slogan on the front of everyone's letters.</P>

      <P>I am not sharing time. Deputy Carey will have ample time to follow on the line of protest in respect of the Government's abuse of the publicly owned companies which belong to the people. Is that not an abuse of competition? The people will make their judgment on that and many other issues in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Another issue which arose during the week in relation to competition should be mentioned. It relates to a European competition which was put in place for the building of a &euro;60 million swimming pool. A body was organised by another arm of the State to vet the different proposals for the project and it handed the contract out to a shelf company which has assets of £4 sterling. When the shelf company gets its hands on the contract it will sell off 95% of it. What are we doing? What will this Bill do to avoid recurrences of such problems in relation to taxpayers' money? It is unsatisfactory that the first contract to be awarded for the Abbotstown project, a major development which will cost £1 billion, stinks to high heaven and that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation does not know what is going on. Why do we pay staff in his Department if they are not dotting the i's and crossing the t's on these issues? It is a matter of competition, having proper structures in place, encouraging fair play for taxpayers and giving better services and facilities to consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues and others have raised a number of issues that are not dealt with in this Bill. We should continually challenge monopolies to ensure fairness for the ordinary people. The biggest monopoly of all is found in the media, where people with money can buy power and <Col N="803" /> attempt to influence the way people should think and vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Competition Bill, 2001. The primary feature of the Bill is its attempt to tackle various problems in relation to competition. Deputy Michael Higgins mentioned the effects of the so-called monopoly in the media. On Second Stage of this Bill in the Seanad, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment dealt with the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, chaired by Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay. The Competition and Mergers Review Group adopted the recommendations, which were based on &ldquo;the special position of the media, including newspapers, as purveyors of information and opinion to the public and as organs of public opinion&rdquo;. The main role of newspapers is as pillars of democracy and journalists should be guarantors of democracy. In the rush for profit, however, they often neglect their fundamental role, as Deputy Higgins pointed out.</P>
      <P>This morning's newspapers attempted to ameliorate the Government's position following its defeat in this week's referendum. The <i>Irish Independent</i> advocated the hare-brained notion of having another referendum, this time to legislate for the X case. The State has endured agonies to try to revise a decision taken a few years ago. The Taoiseach and the Ministers who supported the most recent endeavour deserve to be railed by the media, the pillar of the Constitution, but that did not happen today. The Minister, Deputy Harney, obviously feels she has got to grips with the matter in sections 15 and 22, but media interests do not behave in the manner she desires.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins said, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands does not seem to have been consulted on her role in relation to media competition, in so far as it exists. She made a great deal of her plans to provide for major sporting events to be free to air. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment told the Seanad that the Minister, Deputy de Valera, is consulting with sporting authorities to draw up a list of sporting events which should be free to air, but the latter Minister did not mention this when discussing delays and problems in this House some days ago. Why did she not inform the House? Deputy Higgins has spoken about problems with regard to the recognition of cultural assets, which needs to be enshrined in law, but has not been done in this Bill. I am disappointed that more action has not been taken to regulate this area and to impose greater responsibility on the media to act in a fair and competitive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar issues are seen throughout society, for example in the use of a selective tendering system by local authorities. This does not mean open competition, but political competition at the higher echelons of business. Do we receive better quality service from builders and other service <Col N="804" /> providers who tender for local authority infrastructural development contracts? I do not think so. A number of companies have collapsed while developing national primary routes, despite the fact that local authorities, presumably, used the special tendering system to choose them. If there had been a serious examination of the companies during the selection process, such events would have been avoided. Why does a company which has been chosen in a selective tendering system take three times longer to complete the same section of road than a similar company? I do not know if the Comptroller and Auditor General takes a jaundiced view of the matter, but perhaps he should examine the differences between work completed by private contractors and local authorities. A local authority's tradition of providing employment may mean that it takes years to complete a section of road that a contractor would finish in six months. This Bill does not seem to make provisions for local authorities or semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke earlier about Aer Lingus, which once refused to provide an air service between Shannon and Dublin. Aer Arann, a small company, stepped in to provide the service instead. This was so successful that Aer Lingus returned to the market, charging £79 return between Shannon and Dublin, compared to the previous price of £160. The success of Aer Arann meant that the price was then reduced even further, to £39 return. Naturally enough, consumers availed of the larger and slicker Aer Lingus service and Aer Arann had to retire from the market. Following Aer Lingus' most recent withdrawal, on the grounds that profits can be maximised by serving Malta, north Africa or similar exotic routes, it seems that Aer Arann will once more be the saviour of the service between Shannon and Dublin. Industry in the west of Ireland and early morning flights do not matter to Aer Lingus, but people in my region are resilient. They do not mind getting up early to travel to Dublin and spending 48 hours on their feet doing business. Although Aer Lingus has the ear of officials in the Department of Public Enterprise and the Minister's policy is to listen to Aer Lingus first, consumers have not benefited.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined that the new provisions in section 32 are based on the advice of the CMRG and will underpin and enhance existing levels of co-operation between the relevant bodies. What does that mean in the context of the carry on we have experienced from Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and the ESB? I am aware of a case at Dublin Airport in which Aer Rianta used a spurious excuse called a red line to object to two local landowners developing a car park. I do not know how many questions I have tabled to the Minister about this red line which is supposed to mark a red zone surrounding the airport for the purposes of aircraft safety. However, Aer Rianta is able to move this line. When planning permission was denied, Aer Rianta and the large property company, Dunloe, bid for the same land <Col N="805" /> and received planning permission for a car park. Aer Rianta put the screws on the two landowners. Is this not a case of Aer Rianta abusing its dominant position? The company's actions were a disgrace, but no one seems to care about the manner in which these people ride roughshod over others. The red zone is peculiar in that the Minister who is responsible for Aer Rianta does not seem to wish to take action to keep the company under control or to tackle it over its abuse of its dominant position.</P>
    <P>The same is the case with Aer Lingus and the ESB. Deputy O'Malley referred to the ESB's company newspaper. This publication sometimes contains quality articles, but it sells the message of the company's dominant position. In the long run this position will cause difficulties, although it has not done so as regards the ESOP.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the criticism surrounding the preparations for the budget. IBEC, that august body which represents major industry, launched a missile when it referred to the necessity for the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to introduce a competitive budget. On budget day IBEC rushed to compliment the Minister, but forgot its edicts about competitiveness. The budget was inflationary, but not a word was said. IBEC is now waking up to the fact that there are competitive difficulties which were created by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Worst of all is that when one asks a question of the Minister for Finance regarding competitiveness all one gets from the Department is waffle. I asked the Minister for Finance about the means by which he measures competitiveness. I asked him to cite a basket of goods which the Department uses to frame the budget and which would show how Irish people compare with others in the euro zone. However, I would be happy to show the House how intelligent people in the Department of Finance can produce the greatest waffle which any Member ever received by way of an answer.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that financial people are ruled by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who can get away with this stuff. What about competition? This is not on. I wish the Minister of State well. His heart is usually in the right place, but I do not know about the Minister, Deputy Harney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members who participated in this debate on the Competition Bill, 2001, and for signalling their intent to facilitate progress through the next Stages. It is good to see that there is broad support across the House for this Bill and the principles it seeks to implement.</P>
      <P>The Bill is still open to improvement and a number of matters have been raised in this debate which are likely to lead to more detailed discussion on Committee Stage. We intend to give serious consideration to all the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that the criminal regime for competition offences, and the changes to it intro<Col N="806" /> duced by this Bill, have attracted the most comment. In particular, concern was raised by several Deputies about the efficacy of the regime since its introduction in 1996 and, more fundamentally, the appropriateness of criminal sanctions for anti-competitive behaviour.</P>
    <P>Criminal penalties were introduced by the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, to ensure that serious, anti-competitive behaviour could be dealt with effectively. Deputy Flanagan referred to introducing economic fines along the lines of those imposed by the European Commission. However, as the Deputy also noted, there is a constitutional impediment to imposing significant fines outside the criminal process. In other words, there is no way under our present constitutional arrangements to provide for a level of fines appropriate to the scale of damage caused by anti-competitive behaviour without making that behaviour criminal.</P>
    <P>On a similar theme, Deputy Rabbitte pointed to the procedural and practical difficulties faced by the Competition Authority in prosecuting cases to date. As regards the former, the Bill goes some way to tackle these problems, for example with the introduction of the presumption in section 6(2). This has been described variously as draconian and inappropriate, and Deputies Flanagan and Perry raised concerns about its effect. However, as has been stated before by the Minister, the presumption in section 6(2) relates only to one part of the proof necessary to secure a conviction. It will still be necessary for the prosecution to prove, first, that there was an anti-competitive agreement in place, and, second, that the accused was a party to that agreement. It is only then that the presumption as to the object and effect of that agreement comes into play.</P>
    <P>Moreover, section 43 was amended in the Seanad to extend the search powers of the authority with a view to enhancing their ability to secure convictions. This measure will not meet with universal approval and Deputy Perry rightly pointed to the need to maintain balance between the rights of individuals and the investigation of crime. These crimes are analogous to serious fraud offences and, in that light, it is appropriate to give the authority investigative tools similar to those recently given to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also referred to a number of individual cases which were investigated by the authority and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I should point out to the House that the DPP and the authority are independent statutory authorities and it is for them to determine how they should carry out their statutory functions. The Minister has, however, requested our Department to pursue with the authority the type of difficulties which have arisen in the cases concerned and she hopes to be in a position to advise the House further on the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Aside from this Bill, the Competition Authority has received significantly increased <Col N="807" /> resources over the past two years. In view of this it is hoped that the difficulties encountered in progressing civil and criminal cases, adverted to by Deputy Rabbitte, will be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>Another significant area of concern was Part 3 of the Bill which deals with merger control, about which some interesting points were raised. In particular, it is agreed that there is a need for special considerations for media mergers but there are differences of opinion as to how to legislate for those considerations. Deputy Rabbitte suggested a provision to restrict cross-media ownership within fixed limits, while Deputy Flanagan adverted to restricting the ministerial power to intervene to cases where the Competition Authority has first cleared the merger. The Minister sees merit in this latter proposal and she is disposed towards introducing an amendment along those lines.</P>
    <P>While the idea of market share limits for media mergers has its attractions, I can see immense difficulties in formulating statutory provisions to give it effect. It would be necessary to define the relevant media markets, determine a maximum permitted share of those markets and to take account of changing circumstances in technology, markets and competition domestically and from abroad. The Bill proposes a flexible system permitting the exercise of judgment on a case by case basis, backed by full powers to block any media merger that is anti-competitive or offends the public interest in some other way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. There was also much discussion about the proposed regime for non-media mergers and the abolition of any public interest test. It is true that the Competition and Mergers Review Group recommended the retention of public interest criteria but they have rarely, if ever, been invoked. Rather, competition criteria have formed the basis for decisions. Accordingly, there is little practical reason to retain them.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the need for a strong consumer focus, both in this legislation and in the work of the Competition Authority. I dispute any contention that this Bill does not provide such a focus. If enacted, the Bill will enhance both the enforcement and the advocacy role of the authority. Together, these are important tools to secure one of the main aims of competition policy &ndash; to bring tangible benefits to consumers, such as lower prices and increased choice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan made reference to the role of consumer bodies in highlighting anti-competitive practices. It is unnecessary, however, to give any statutory powers to organisations such as the Consumers Association to make complaints to the Competition Authority. It is open to any body, either in its own right or on behalf of members, to bring the matter to the attention of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" />Deputy Perry expressed the concern that normal trade representative association activities could be restricted under the Bill. The point of the Bill is to deter anti-competitive behaviour, whether by individual undertakings or by associations of undertakings. It is well established that anti-competitive agreements, such as collusion on prices, can take place through the medium of associations. Provided that associations steer clear of activities which are prohibited and penalised under the Bill, as is similarly the case under the present legislation, they have nothing to fear from this Bill. Some specific provisions in the Bill are of assistance in this regard. Section 28(1)(<i>d</i>), which was included by way of Senate amendment, empowers the Competition Authority to publish notices containing practical guidance as to how the provisions of the Act may be complied with. Section 4(3) empowers the authority to issue category declarations &ndash; statements that specified categories of agreements, decisions or concerted practices are compatible with section 4 of the Bill. These and other provisions of the Bill will enable the authority to be pro-active in offering guidance and advice to all sectors of the economy, including business organisations.</P>
    <P>The definitive interpretation of any provision of the Bill, including those relating to the core concepts such as &ldquo;restriction of competition&rdquo; or &ldquo;abuse of dominant position&rdquo; will continue to be a matter for the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan raised the matter of accountability to the Oireachtas of bodies such as the authority. This Bill will increase accountability. As things stand, there is no such direct reporting between the authority and the Oireachtas but section 36 will oblige the chairperson to appear before the Public Accounts Committee, while the Tánaiste has given a further undertaking in the Seanad to introduce an amendment to require the authority to appear before the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Clearly, these are substantial improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan also referred to the Grocery Order. That will not be affected by this Bill. Deputy O'Malley referred to the lack of public interest in competition policy. The Bill will provide advocacy powers to the authority and will retain the same principle regarding media mergers as the 1978 Act. I acknowledge the Deputy's work in the past in this area. He also mentioned the meat industry, as did Deputy Crawford, and the enforcement of mergers provisions. Whatever deficiencies existed in the 1978 Act, there are clear enforcement powers in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins covered a wide range of issues. It is because we realise that media mergers are different, and involve cultural as well as economic issues, that we have special provisions and criteria for such mergers. The concerns expressed by the Deputy are fully reflected in the Bill. He referred to the need for consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I assure him that we will carry out such consultations. I thank the Deputy for his com<Col N="809" /> ments on my role in the ILO. As the Minister of State with responsibility for labour, I find this to be a most important area of my work.</P>

This has been a strong area for this State over the course successive Governments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has spoken on the development of the WTO on many occasions. If the work of the WTO in recent years, particularly at the Doha meeting, and the role of the EU Ministers are examined, the emphasis on the developing world will be clear. The environment is also near the top of the agenda. We did not succeed in getting what we wanted at the WTO ILO forum but that is unfinished business and we are nearly there. The EU and the Irish Government have made a difference by highlighting the needs of the developing world. We are all aware of what happened with regard to access to medicines and I hope the next Government will continue with that work.</P>

      <P>Yes. It should be remembered that this Bill provides a framework within which a great deal of activity will take place over the coming years. It does not, and cannot in itself, provide answers to the many detailed questions and situations that will arise. The Bill sets out rules and procedures, rights and obligations, which will be put into effect by the institutions concerned. Foremost among these will be the Competition Authority and the courts. Our job, as legislators, is to make sure that we get that framework right and I believe the Bill does that. There is a lot of technical detail in this Bill and it is important that we get that right too. As I have indicated, there will be some Government amendments for consideration on Committee Stage and no doubt there will be Opposition amendments as well.

      <P>The overall objective of pensions policy is to ensure that all retired persons have an adequate income to enable them to live with dignity and to share in the benefits of economic growth. In this regard, this Bill is one of the Government's top priorities and a specific commitment of the PPF. It is the culmination of considerable research and debate about new and emerging challenges for pensions policy.</P>

      <P>I am sorry but I, or somebody else, discommoded some of my colleagues. The Bill was published in July last year and, as I promised at that time, there has been a significant degree of consultation on its provisions. Over 200 comments were made and my officials have examined each of these in consultation with the Pensions Board. On foot of this process, a large number of technical amendments were made during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Given the overall aim of developing pensions policy, the legislation has a number of key objectives, which briefly are as follows. First, increasing overall occupational pension coverage, which is currently less then 50% of those at work. The main mechanism addressing this is the personal retirement savings account, PRSA, framework, which is provided for in Part 2 of the Bill. Second, providing a right of redress for those who have a dispute or complaint in relation to an occupational pension scheme and, in due course, a PRSA through the introduction of a pensions ombudsman. This is provided for in Part 3 of the Bill. Third, enhancing the current provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, to improve the position of existing and future pension scheme members in terms of the security and quality of their pension entitlements allied with providing increased flexibility. These improvements are set out in Part 4 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently 630,000 members of occupational pension schemes and pension fund assets amount to &euro;52 billion, equivalent to 54% of GNP. The purpose of the Pensions Act, 1990, is to regulate occupational pension schemes, to ensure that they are properly administered and, above all, to <Col N="811" /> ensure that the pension rights of members and their dependants are safeguarded. The Pensions Board was established under this Act as the statutory regulatory authority. The board comprises a chairperson and 14 members who are representative of the trade unions, employers and various professional groups in the pension industry, together with departmental representatives and three nominees of the Minister. It is widely accepted that the board represents partnership in operation and that the current arrangements work well. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the fine work it undertakes.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are based on a detailed examination of the proposals of the national pension policy initiative, NPPI, set out in the board's report, Securing Retirement Income, various other policy reports received from the Pensions Board and experience of the operation of the Pensions Act to date. The current system of pensions coverage in this country comprises a compulsory social insurance pillar and voluntary occupational and personal pension pillars. In meeting the objective of adequate provision for people in retirement, the strategy is one of a reasonable social welfare pension on a flat rate basis supplemented by an occupational and-or personal pension to give an earnings related pension.</P>
    <P>There is considerable ongoing debate on the pros and cons of voluntary versus mandatory second pillar provision. The unanimous view of the Pensions Board in its NPPI report was that pension coverage should be extended on a voluntary basis in that while employers would have to provide access to pension schemes, contributions would not be mandatory. In the board's view it is essential to balance the risks and costs of compulsion with the benefits it can achieve and to go no further down the road of compulsion than is necessary. The board considered that full mandatory provision should be held in reserve but could be introduced following a review of the effectiveness of the measures adopted. It saw this review taking place five years after implementation of the proposals.</P>
    <P>I have considered this approach in detail, which is fundamental to the coverage issue and how I proceed, and, on balance, given the partnership basis of the board, I have accepted its views in this area. However, it will be necessary to monitor the impact of PRSAs, as is required under the PPF. In this regard, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has asked questions in relation to pensions coverage in its quarter one national household survey this year. The results of this, which will be available in May, will provide a benchmark coverage rate against which changes can then be measured. All are agreed that if the proposed PRSA arrangements do not succeed on a voluntary basis, the position regarding mandatory pensions provision will have to be reviewed sooner rather than later. In considering the reports of the board I was conscious, as was the board itself, of <Col N="812" /> the need to extend coverage without undermining existing provision, particularly defined benefit, and the need to ensure a balance between protection and equitable treatment on the one hand and over-regulation and cost on the other.</P>
    <P>There is much discussion on the changing work environment and the requirements of both employers and employees in the area of remuneration packages, which includes pensions. There is a role here for all the social partners both at national and firm level to ensure that workers are well informed and that, for example, people do not consider any pension to be a good pension.</P>
    <P>It is important that a person knows the real value of the pension he or she can reasonably expect to have in retirement which of course depends crucially on the level of contributions made by the employer and the employee. There is no doubt that one pension arrangement does not fit all and that pension reform is an ongoing process which must be monitored, evaluated and amended as necessary. I assume these issues will be addressed in the partnership process going forward.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Bill's main provisions, we wish to increase the level of occupational and personal pensions coverage from less than 50% at present to 70% of total workforce over 30 years of age. To do this we are setting up a new type of pension &ndash; the personal retirement savings account or PRSA &ndash; as provided for in section 3 of the Bill. The PRSA will be a low cost, easy access, long-term personal investment account designed to allow people to save for retirement in a flexible manner and it will complement the social welfare pension. The PRSA will be a contract-based product between an individual and a PRSA provider.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that PRSA products will be approved by the Pensions Board and the Revenue Commissioners. On foot of further consultation since the Bill's publication with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, amendments were made in the Seanad in relation to the licensing of the PRSA provider. The Bill as amended now provides that the PRSA provider will be the following appropriately authorised entities: an investment firm, an insurance undertaking and a credit institution which produces, markets or sells PRSA products. This means, for example, that existing financial entities who are already appropriately licensed by the Central Bank or the Department of Enterprise. Trade and Employment can be PRSA providers. Any entity which wishes to be a PRSA provider can apply to the Central Bank for authorisation to undertake this type of business.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provision for standard PRSAs, which will be &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; products with charges capped at 5% of contributions and 1% per annum of the assets. Any person will be able to make contributions to a PRSA irrespective of employment status. Employees can take PRSAs with them when changing jobs and con<Col N="813" /> tributors will be able to take benefits from a PRSA from age 60. The Bill also sets out disclosure requirements on PRSA providers including statements of reasonable projection to signed-up contributors showing at various times and on an individualised basis the level of benefit, which can reasonably be expected.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes at section 4 the tax provision that will govern PRSAs. These are in line with the tax provisions that apply to occupational pension schemes and retirement annuity contracts or RACs generally. Tax relief will be allowed at the contributor's marginal rate subject to age-based limits to contributions. The age-based limits are 5% higher at ages 30 to 50 to give PRSAs a chance to get off the ground. Unused relief can be carried forward and benefits will be taxable in the hands of the contributor when paid out, subject to a tax free lump sum equal to 25% of the value of the assets in the PRSA at commencement of benefits.</P>
    <P>Contributors will not be forced to take an annuity. The new ARF options introduced in 1999 for persons investing in RACs will be available, subject to the same requirements. Employer contributions to a PRSA on behalf of an employee will be allowed as a deduction in arriving at the employer's profits for tax purposes. Transfers from an occupational pension scheme to a PRSA will be allowed in the case of a person changing employment or the wind-up of a scheme provided that person was a member of the scheme for less than 15 years. All of these arrangements, which relate to the PRSA product, are for the benefit of the consumer, namely the PRSA contributor.</P>
    <P>Given the commitment of the social partners to promoting pensions coverage, I hope that PRSAs will lead to a significant increase in coverage, especially for those with no cover at present, which would include a large proportion of women; it is appropriate to mention that today, International Women's Day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill, employers will have to provide access to at least one standard PRSA. While employer contributions to PRSAs will not be mandatory, I hope employers will contribute where possible so as to enhance the quality of the pension benefit for the employee.</P>
      <P>Following amendments in the Seanad, the time limit for bringing cases to the ombudsman has been increased from three to six years from the date of action giving rise to the dispute, or longer than that if the ombudsman decides that it would be reasonable to extend the period. There will, however, be an absolute limit of six years prior to the establishment of the office and the office will be financed by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ombudsman will be appointed by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I hope that this office can be established as early as possible, taking account of the legal and <Col N="814" /> administrative arrangements that have to be considered, following enactment. Part 4 of the Bill provides for a significant number of improvements to the existing provisions of the Act which, on enactment, will be of significant benefit to a large number of pension scheme members including the following: reduction in the vesting period from five to two years; preservation and revaluation of benefit will be extended to pre-1991 service; we will introduce a minimum value of contributory retirement benefit equal to 120% of the member's contributions which will mitigate the effect of integration with the social welfare pension for low income earners on reaching retirement; and there will be a mandatory review and disclosure procedure relating to indexation of pensions in payment. The Bill also provides for mandatory disclosure and consultation with members regarding the treatment of surpluses in cases of scheme wind-ups and bulk transfers and there will be a statutory requirement on employers to remit employee pension contributions within a specified period of 21 days.</P>
    <P>I intend that the proposals in relation to vesting, preservation and revaluation pre-1991 and the minimum contributory retirement benefit will come into effect from 1 June this year. These measures will be of significant benefit to those who plan to leave their current pension scheme, for example, on change of employment. I am aware from inquiries to my Department that there are many people awaiting this legislation.</P>
    <P>Following amendments in the Seanad, the Bill now also provides for the implementation of EU Directive 98/49/EC, known as the mobility directive, which deals with the safeguarding of the pension rights of workers moving within the Community, and regulations to be made to deal with pensions matters under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001. Regarding the position of the board itself, to enhance its composition and mindful of its increased responsibilities with the introduction of PRSAs, section 50 provides that it will be extended by the addition of a representative of consumer interests.</P>
    <P>The pensions strategy going forward has to contribute to the development of social and economic policy in Ireland in a positive and efficient way. Overall, policy has to lead to pensions which are both adequate and sustainable and this is the challenge for all of us involved in the debate. Pensions legislation is an evolving document and while this Bill is a significant milestone, it is by no means the end of the process. Issues remain for my Department to monitor and address in the future, most notably in relation to the quality of coverage.</P>
    <P>This leads to the area of information on pension provision and the need to raise overall awareness among the public of the issues involved. The Pensions Board recommended a national pensions awareness campaign as a prerequisite to improving coverage and the Government accepts this recommendation. My Depart<Col N="815" /> ment will discuss this in detail with the board following enactment of this Bill, which I hope will be enacted by Easter.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and thank Members, particularly Senators, for allowing it to come to the House. They were subjected to difficult circumstances in bringing forward considerable changes. I thank Opposition spokespersons for their very positive welcome for the Bill even before they contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now nearly four years since the Pensions Board reported to the Government on the need to introduce and provide a more flexible pension scheme so as to increase the level of pensions coverage in the wider society. This recommendation, along with many others, followed exhaustive research from the national pensions policy initiative, which took place from 1996 to 1998. It is a matter of concern that it has taken the Government four years to have this matter debated in the House. The first draft of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001 was published by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on 27 July last. While the Bill was considered by the Senate in some detail in recent months the timescale involved for a full debate in the Dáil and select committee is less than satisfactory. It is unfortunate that the Government has decided to railroad the legislation through during the dying days of the 28th Dáil. It is not good enough that a major piece of legislation such as this should only be afforded three or four hours of debate on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It was the intention of the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs that specific hearings would take place on the proposed Bill between Second and Committee Stage so that all members of the select committee could contribute in a constructive way. Unfortunately there are only 13 days between Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill. This is not the way to treat the Dáil or the select committee.</P>
      <P>This is an important piece of legislation which will affect pension policy in this country for the next decade. We need to ensure the legislation is both watertight and workable. To this end, my party will contribute in a positive and constructive way to ensure the Bill obtains the scrutiny it deserves. The issue of providing long-term pension cover is now a critical issue for the development of our country. While the proportion of our population at work is much higher than in other EU countries, over the next 30 years that proportion will fall quite dramatically. At the moment there are five people working in the economy for every one person who is retired. I understand that after 2006 that proportion will fall and that it could reach a two to one ratio by 2050.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are clearly demographic changes taking place in the country which must be provided for in terms of increasing funds for the national State pension and other occupational or personal pen<Col N="816" /> sion schemes. Over the next 20 years, a 10% increase in life expectancy is projected which will increase pension costs and cover. The State has an obligation to provide sufficient funds to meet expected demand on the State pension provision while also providing an incentive for people to provide their own pension schemes in the years ahead. It is not only prudent for the State to put money aside for this increasing financial demand, but it is also prudent that individuals now at work would provide for their own future in respect of other pension schemes. While the latest information on the level of pension cover within the workforce will not be made available until later this year, I understand that approximately 50% of the workforce currently has private pension coverage. The key recommendation of the Pensions Board was that over the next five to ten years a target of 70% private pension coverage should be achieved.</P>
    <P>This recommendation was made in 1998 and it is now 2002. It is unfortunate that we have lost four years in trying to reach the target set by the Pensions Board. Four years later we still have not seen a significant uptake in private pension cover. In fact it is considered that pension coverage has not kept pace with the additional number of people working in recent years. While the total number of people in pension schemes may have increased, that figure as a proportion of the total workforce is now expected to be less than the 50% indicated in the last official survey. This will make it even more difficult to reach the 70% target within five to ten years as set out in the original Pensions Board report and indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that may well affect the take-up rate of the new personal retirement savings accounts is that many people could confuse these new products with the savings scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance. From documents released under the Freedom of Information Act in March of last year, it is clear that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, went against the advice of his officials when he introduced the savings scheme in the 2001 Finance Act. One of the concerns raised by officials in the Department of Finance at the time was that the savings scheme would reduce the incentive for people to put money into pension schemes. I am concerned at the possible negative affects the Government's savings scheme could have on the introduction of PRSAs. There is a good deal of confusion in the mind of Government on this issue. No one can predict with accuracy whether the heavily subsidised Government savings scheme will lead to a lower take-up rate in the new PRSAs. However, I would do the House a disservice if I did not highlight this issue at this particular time.</P>
    <P>Many of the Bill's provisions will update and modernise existing pension legislation in this country. Despite these positive developments, one of the most obvious issues that is not confronted in the Bill is the issue of employer contributions. Employers who do not operate pension <Col N="817" /> schemes are required to provide access to PRSAs but are not required to contribute to them. While I am aware of the consensus position arrived at in the 1998 Pensions Board report the fact is that, unless some contribution is made by employers, the take-up level of the new PRSAs and their long-term real value will be severely reduced. As the issue of employer contributions has not been addressed, the legislation will inevitably be reviewed within five or ten years. The Government has gone the voluntary route in attempting to increase pension cover. If this route is not successful then compulsion will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>My party will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage setting out targets for the take-up of the new PRSAs. If these targets are not matched, an automatic review of the entire legislation should be initiated. While I am aware that the Minister has brought forward many amendments to the Bill on Committee and Report Stage in the Senate, I believe the tax provisions attached to these new pension products are unnecessarily complicated. When this Bill is enacted we will, in effect, have three different tax regimes applying to different forms of pensions, one for occupational pension schemes, one for retirement annuity contracts and one for PRSAs. There is likely to be huge public confusion on the various tax provisions that apply to all of these pension schemes. We need to move to a more unified tax code for the provision of pension policy in this country. The more confusion that exists, the lower the take-up rate of pension cover will be. We have to make the procedures as simple and understandable as possible for all concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the national pensions policy initiative was to simplify pensions into two distinct pension regimes. One set of rules will apply to occupational pension schemes and another to PRSAs. As currently drafted, the Bill is still unnecessarily complex. I hope we can look at improving the provisions that exist, particularly in the area of the PRSAs.</P>
    <P>The tax rules that apply are not only confusing but also highlight an underlying inequality in respect of private pensions. Tax relief is greatest for those top income earners who can afford to put away substantial amounts of income for the purpose of savings. Many organisations have already highlighted the underlying inequality in the tax treatment of pensions. While it is perfectly sensible that tax relief should exist as a form of incentivising pension cover, it should also apply that the tax relief itself is fair and directed towards those who need it most. We should not forget that the objective of this Bill is to encourage those who currently have no pension cover to take up such cover in the form of the new PRSAs. While the new PRSAs may sell well, they may increase pension cover for people with existing policies rather than reaching the majority of workers who are uncovered. This point should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" />The ESRI quantified the cost of tax expenditure on occupational pensions in 1997 and it estimated that the cost of tax relief on the net income of approved schemes was &euro;822 million or almost 1.5% of GNP. This tax expenditure amounted to two thirds of direct expenditure on social welfare provision in that year and is projected to exceed direct expenditure in a few years time if present trends continue. The introduction of PRSAs is clearly an attempt to increase pension cover amongst people who have not made adequate provision for their future. However, it is very important that the tax relief measures attached to these new pension products are progressive in nature in the effort to attract low income earners into new pension schemes.</P>
    <P>What are we looking for in the new PRSAs? We want a clear set of rules governing the operation of these new products, the application of less complicated tax rules to these products, clear obligations on employers to comply with the wishes of their employees in respect of pension cover, honest assessment as to the amount of funding that will be provided in 20 or 30 years and minimal red tape for employers who participate in these new products. The idea of a flexible, portable form of pension cover, covering both part-time and full-time work, should be seen as a reliable product for workers who wish to put money aside for their retirement years.</P>
    <P>We should always be fully aware of the experience of other countries which have attempted to reform pension provision. A similar initiative in the UK, the stakeholder pension, has proved a colossal flop in terms of the number of workers availing of it. We should learn from the mistakes of other countries in which the promotion of new, flexible products has taken place.</P>
    <P>One of the most important parts of the Bill is the proposal to establish a pensions ombudsman who would adjudicate on complaints received from members of the public. I welcome this initiative. It is high time the pensions industry was supervised by an independent office backed by the force of law so that binding adjudications can be given where there is conflict between parties. The new ombudsman must be given the financial and administrative resources to deal quickly with complaints received in his or her office. There are considerable numbers of schemes in which conflict still exists. Many pensioners feel a huge sense of loss in relation to their own pension schemes. It is essential that we put in place, on a statutory and mandatory basis, full powers for this new ombudsman so that he or she can investigate existing complaints about pension cover.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the new pensions ombudsman as referred to in Part 3 of the Bill is given full statutory powers to investigate all complaints made by members of the public. We have a special responsibility, in establishing the office of the ombudsman, to ensure that maximum powers are vested in his office so that complaints may be vigorously investigated and appropriate sanctions may be brought to bear when it is found <Col N="819" /> that pension schemes are not operating for the benefit of those who contributed to them. Unfortunately, because of past experience, many people in the workforce refuse to contribute to pension schemes because they have little or no trust in some elements of the pensions industry to safeguard their funds in the years ahead. There are a number of well-documented cases in Ireland involving companies and individuals who have betrayed the trust of those who contributed substantial amounts of funds for a long time. We must ensure that the mandate given to the pensions ombudsman is flexible enough that he or she can investigate all complaints made against companies or individuals.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the time limit of three years during which complaints may be made in the original proposal has been changed to six years by the Minister. This was brought about by an amendment in the Seanad. However, I do not believe that any restriction should be placed on the pensions ombudsman in investigating and adjudicating on cases that may come before his or her office. It is the job of legislators to give the ombudsman a completely free hand in whatever work he or she wishes to undertake. Part 3 of the Bill, which deals with the establishment of the pensions ombudsman, needs to be re-drafted so that maximum independence and flexibility is given to the holder of this new office. I am fundamentally opposed to a proposed power within the Bill which would allow the Minister to appoint the new pensions ombudsman. Furthermore, a provision in the Bill which allows the Minister to remove the ombudsman from office at any time if it seems necessary could severely compromise and interfere with the independence of the office.</P>
    <P>I am fundamentally opposed to the provisions of section 5(129) of the Bill which would allow the Minister of the day to terminate or remove the pensions ombudsman from his or her position. This power should rest with a committee of the House and that committee should vet the appointment of the ombudsman. I am taking into account the comments made by a former UK pensions ombudsman who has already highlighted this issue and has argued for an independent ombudsman whose office would be entirely separate from the Executive. It is also suggested that the legislation should allow the ombudsman to delegate his or her responsibilities. This would avoid unnecessary interruptions caused by holidays or breaks and would also lead to a smoother operation of the new office. Two other suggestions were made by the former UK ombudsman when he spoke at a conference hosted by the Association of Pension Lawyers in Ireland last year, at which I understand the Minister also spoke. One relates to the restrictions in the Bill on the amount of redress that could be made if a complaint succeeded. The other suggestion was to clarify the extent of the new ombudsman's jurisdiction to ensure that decisions <Col N="820" /> made by his or her office would be final and binding.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that the new office of the pensions ombudsman acts as a watchdog for the pensions industry. Unfortunately, the establishment of an insurance ombudsman has not had the outcome originally intended. It is very important that mistakes made in the legislation on the insurance ombudsman are not repeated in this Bill. Some progress was made in the Seanad in allowing the Pensions Board and the Revenue Commissioners to vet new PRSA providers. A single regulator would have the advantage of providing greater consumer protection to those who wish to purchase these products and to subscribe to them over a considerable period of time. Although the original McDowell report argued that the Pensions Board should continue with its regulatory role, I believe that it would make sense for one financial regulator to scrutinise all pension products. That regulator could then report to the Houses of the Oireachtas and that would lead to greater transparency and independence and would also result in public support for the vetted pension schemes.</P>
    <P>This makes sense from the point of view of the consumer, but also for the many companies who operate these pension schemes. It is accepted by all that the level of compliance as proposed in the Bill will put considerable pressure on PRSA providers to comply with the regulations. While it is critical that all these regulations are in place, we do not want a system to develop where many potential PRSA providers could be priced out of the market because of over-zealous compliance or excessive costs. While it is essential that those who provide PRSAs fully conform with the new regulations as set out in the Bill, it is equally important that the minimum amount of duplication and regulation is brought to bear on the industry to ensure development of a competitive PRSA market.</P>
    <P>Our objective is to encourage people currently without pension cover to start to pay into pension schemes so that they will later have additional income on top of the national State pension. When I was younger than I am now, at 23 and after only two years in the workforce, I was approached by a company about contributing to pension schemes. The company drew comparisons between itself and other companies in relation to performance. As Senator Ross said in the Seanad, there seems to be no independent verification, over a period of years, of companies' performances in the funds in which they invest. Frequently the companies, many of them well-known in the House, compare their performance and results to those of other companies. However, in many respects, that is not a fair comparison. We should, in some part of the Bill, introduce objective performance criteria for pension cover or for any of the PRSA providers. We can do this and it would be useful. Otherwise the companies will compare themselves for marketing and propaganda purposes. We should have an <Col N="821" /> independent office to verify how well these companies are doing. I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>It is also important to investigate what happens to the substantial sums of money to which the Minister referred in his contribution to the House. Huge sums of money are invested, but how are they used? So much of this money is salted away for a considerable number of years. Nobody assesses the performance of these companies in an independent, verifiable way. What happens to the money invested? That is another critical question.</P>
    <P>One of the issues regularly brought to my attention by constituents is the excessive costs charged by companies to clients who transfer their pensions or attempt to cash them in. Recently a constituent whose husband's firm had been liquidated came to see me. Her husband had been paying into a pension scheme for a considerable time but when he attempted to transfer that scheme to another company, the charge placed by the provider was appalling. It represented about 15% of the total funds accumulated over a period of years. We need to look at this issue in relation to the transferability and the costs that many of these providers are charging to members of the public where they are attempting to transfer or encash their funds.</P>
    <P>Another issue that must be looked at on Committee Stage is the length of time it is taking for people to get money from these companies. Some companies perform well but I am aware of many cases where the efforts of the general public are stymied over a period of months, sometimes years, before they obtain the money to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I turn to an issue to which the Minister did not refer today although he did refer to it in his Second Stage speech to the Seanad, namely the changing nature of work. Some 20 to 30 years ago, the number of people who stayed in a permanent, pensionable job for their working life was much greater than it is now. Members will recognise that the new, flexible workforce regularly sees people change their jobs three, four or five times during their working lives and that people are working less and retiring earlier. The idea of a job for life has come to an end as people move in and out of the workforce. When this Bill is closely scrutinised on Committee Stage, we must ensure that protection is given to those people who will move in and out of work and change their jobs during their working lives. We must ensure they have protection when they want to transfer their pension cover from one company to another or to change the nature of their cover.</P>
    <P>I realise that there is a debate in the industry as to the current level of products under the defined benefit mode, which is about 71%. Increasingly, most of the products coming onto the market are defined contributions. In other words, the employer is not underwriting the funds over a period of years and the liability is taken up by the employee rather than the employer. There has <Col N="822" /> been a fundamental shift in cover from defined benefit to defined contributions. It is a real issue and, irrespective of what scheme is put in place, people need to know that the money they put away over their working life is guaranteed.</P>
    <P>However, we also need to tell people that they should be saving more than they are. In good economic times, and particularly in recent years when the economy has been in good condition, people should have been saving more money for difficult times ahead. People are encouraged to save about 15% of their gross income every year. We need to use this Bill, and the opportunities presented therein, as a way to highlight the need to encourage more workers to put money away and to do it in a way that will give maximum return. When PRSAs are in place, if people are contributing small amounts of money they will not get much money in return, particularly if there are no employer contributions. We must be honest and recognise this issue to which we must return on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Over the past year, and particularly since 11 September, the funds markets throughout the world have dipped substantially, particularly when investment in Europe and the revenue lost by many companies is considered. This scheme is being launched at a time when there has been a major hit on the global economic market. We are trying to sell the message of encouraging more people to put money aside at a time when pension funds and the real asset value of global markets has been severely reduced. It will be a difficult message to sell when there has been such bad news about investments and savings and share prices in recent years.</P>
    <P>We should also look at initiatives taking place in other parts of the world. The British Labour Government has mooted a proposal which would give all newborn children a lump sum savings bond which could then be contributed to by that person as that person grows older. It is a novel idea and if the PRSAs do not take off and we do not get an increase in the numbers of people saving, the State will have to look at a new savings scheme to encourage people to put money aside throughout their lives. If a part of that is a direct incentive at the time of birth, we will have to look at it. The nest egg proposal that has come from the British Government is one we should at least consider in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I made the point yesterday on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill that many pensioners who do not have occupational pension schemes are asked to live on the non-contributory pension. That is not a huge sum of money today although we have seen welcome increases in recent years. However, the real income power of many pensioners who do not have private pension cover has been reducing as a proportion of the general increase in income in other parts of the economy. We need to look at providing a pension supplement for people who are solely dependent on the State pension. We may discuss this on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" />I thank the Minister's officials and all interested parties from industry, the Pensions Board and the Revenue Commissioners who spent time with me and others going through this Bill. I am approaching it in as constructive a way as possible in the very short time available. We have an obligation to scrutinise this, give it the best possible hearing and, if possible, improve it in the weeks ahead. I look forward to working with the Minister and his officials in the weeks ahead to improve this Bill and to get the maximum cover for those who do not currently have any pension cover.</P>

      <P>I thank Ms Anne Lohan, the staff of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the Pensions Board who met with me recently to brief me on the Bill. I would welcome their assistance over the next week or ten days to help to amend the legislation in some areas.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001 with a number of serious qualifications. Almost four years after the presentation of the national pensions policy initiative report by the Pensions Board to Dáil Éireann, the Government is finally getting around to legislating for its central recommendations. The introduction of the personal retirement savings accounts and the provision of a statutory basis for a pensions ombudsman are major developments in the improvement of the coverage and regulation of so-called second pillar or occupational pensions.</P>
      <P>However, the Labour Party believes that a unique opportunity for a radical expansion of the pension entitlements and rights of workers has been lost in the formulation of this Bill which refuses to address many of the key issues which inhibit the take-up of occupational pensions. The lack of a mandatory requirement on employers to contribute to a PRSA scheme for their workforce is a major cop-out from the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and this Government, and places a question mark over their sincerity and commitment to implement the NPPI report, Securing Retirement Income. Likewise, the failure to legislate for a new transparent and fully accountable system for investment pension products, whether under the new PRSAs, older type occupational pension schemes or private pension plans, is another remarkable evasion of responsibility by the outgoing Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a pensions ombudsman along the lines of the British model has been a fervent wish of pensioners for many years. Many pensioners come from companies in the private sector, such as the Irish Press Group, Ford motor company, Tara Mines and from public sector companies like Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta where there are long-standing perceptions that former workers have been treated unfairly. Yet, the time and investigation limits imposed by this Bill on <Col N="824" /> the new ombudsman's ability to investigate complaints from pensioners will severely restrict the ability of the new office to ensure that justice is done to pensioners of older occupational schemes. It is also difficult to see from this legislation how the ombudsman could avert a future Irish version of Robert Maxwell since Part 3 does not give the new investigating officer sufficient powers of inquiry into the management and auditing of pension funds.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a number of valuable amendments to the Pensions Act, 1990, and the Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1996, in Part 4 also highlights the glaring omission of legal reform of key problems in current occupational pensions. For example, there is no attempt to deal with the contentious issues of the ownership and distribution of surpluses in existing schemes. The trade union movement has long complained that where a surplus in an occupational scheme exists, companies are able to reduce their contributions to the scheme and, in some cases, to take a total contribution holiday. Employees and pensioners also demand that the claw-back by companies of a portion of the State old age pension from their occupational pensions should be greatly restricted or abolished. Yet the issues of claw-backs and the attempted integration of State contributory and occupational pensions are not, as far as I can see, tackled in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the role of the Pensions Board as regulator of the PRSA product and providers is not matched by a widening of its membership in section 50. While the appointment of one consumer representative is welcome in the increase to 15 board members, many pensioners and members of occupational schemes regard this change as a mere sop to their concerns. Why did the Minister not consider the appointment of at least two representatives of a recognised pensioners' body such as the Senior Citizens Parliament or the retired workers committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as well as perhaps at least two consumer advocates? Other interested parties such as insurance brokers have also complained to me about the perceived unrepresentative nature of the structure of the new Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>However, before any of these caveats regarding the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001, the Labour Party is furious at the treatment of this legislation by the Minister and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats outgoing Government.</P>

      <P>I write my own speeches. I was a speech writer. From May 1998, the Government had the NPPI report to hand, but it sat on it for almost three years before, first, Part 2, the personal retirement savings accounts, and, finally, the rest of the current Bill appeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 October 2001, the Minister rightly told<i> The Irish Times: </i>&ldquo;My Department regards this as <Col N="825" /> the single most important piece of legislation that it has brought to the Oireachtas in recent years&rdquo;.  I told the Taoiseach yesterday that it is perhaps the most important legislation in this 28th Dáil. The Minister said: &ldquo;I am open to reasonable amendment to the Bill and I would encourage everyone to take a look at the Bill as it has been drafted with a view to participating in the process.&rdquo; He also said: &ldquo;The Government has agreed to give priority to passing the Bill during the current Dáil.&rdquo; Yet here we are in the dying days of the 28th Dáil, imposing a guillotine after a few hours debate on this most important Bill. Why could we not have had a week or a two week long debate because, as I said yesterday on the Order of Business, almost every Deputy would have liked to have contributed to the debate on this Bill? Why could we not have had a week long debate on these issues perhaps in 1999, 2000 or 2001 during one of the languid periods when the Dáil was totally unnecessarily adjourned? The lethargy of the Minister in failing to bring the Pensions (Amendment) Bill to this House before the final few days of a five year term is breathtaking in its incompetence and carelessness.</P>
    <P>It matches his failure to bring forward other key legislative measures from his Department, including especially the Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill which has also languished on the Order Paper for five years. Worst of all, stakeholders and representative bodies with an interest in the Pensions (Amendment) Bill have just over a week to contact Opposition parties and assist us in putting forward necessary amendments to the Bill. The original proposed Committee Stage timetable was even tighter to facilitate the Minister and his Government colleagues in their far flung travels around the world next week to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.</P>

      <P>The ramming through Dáil Éireann of this Bill in a few hours does a great disservice to pensioners, workers, their families and their representatives in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are generally regarded as being at the top of the league table of EU countries with regard to future pension provision because of the large size of the occupational pension funds of these three countries. Most of our EU partners have very generous pay as one goes pension systems, but recent decades have seen a growing anxiety across Europe at the prospect of the so-called demographic pension time bomb. In the mid and late 1990s countries such as Spain, Italy, France and Germany all passed landmark new pension laws, as I suppose we are doing today, designed to encourage second pillar private occupational pension schemes and the creation of pension funds. The German Government was particularly concerned at the underestimation of pension liabilities in company accounts, while state pension liabilities in France and Germany <Col N="826" /> exceeded the size of gross domestic product by more than 100%.</P>
    <P>While other countries have sought to emulate the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Ireland, the ongoing EU pensions debate has also often rightly focused on the fundamental purpose of pensions, namely, the provision of an adequate and comfortable retirement income which enables pensioners to live a full life in dignity. The Socialist French Government has a Minister for Solidarity between Generations &ndash; perhaps a position we could have in this country. The policy paper of the Industrial Society by Ms Sue Ward, called Pension Tension, on the reform of Britain's pensions notes that whether pensions are privately funded or pay as one goes, pensions are in either case a charge on the economy at the time they are paid. The same study praises the Swedish central collecting institution for occupational pensions &ndash; I note there is no such institution in the Bill &ndash; and the Irish pension reserve fund because both initiatives in Sweden and Ireland show the state clearly underpinning future adequate national pensions. I note the Minister referred in an oblique way to this issue in his contribution when he seemed to refer to some central underpinning of all occupational pensions. That is thinking I would welcome.</P>
    <P>The improvements in Irish contributory and non-contributory old age pensions in recent budgets, while not attaining the targets urged by the Labour Party and the NPPI report in 1998, have reiterated the strong desire of the people for a foundation first pillar pension which is adequate for full participation in society. The enhancement and development of the State pension remains a key objective of the Labour Party and it is also the foundation stone of our pensions policy. The Labour Party is also concerned at the move to deferred contribution systems, which are much riskier for employees, and away from the deferred benefits system, which gives income security to older people.</P>
    <P>The asset allocation survey of the Irish Association of Pension Funds estimated that the total assets of Irish pension funds rose to &euro;52.5 billion by the end of December 2000, with over 64% of assets invested in equities. It was then estimated that there were 630,000 members of about 73,000 occupational schemes. Ongoing surveys, however, by business and trade unions have shown a continuing lack of provision of second pillar or occupational pensions. An Allied Irish Banks customer survey in July 2001, for example, showed that half the respondents had no private pension or occupational pension and only one in three were aware that such a pension could qualify for tax relief at the person's marginal rate. The same survey found that the preferred retirement age was still 60 years and people had not made provision for additional funding of their income for perhaps 20 or 25 years of active life after retirement.</P>
    <P>The vice president of SIPTU, Mr. Jack O'Connor, has also continually expressed con<Col N="827" /> cern that well over 60% of people in private sector employment do not have occupational pensions and, at its conference last year, the trade union worried that this figure was increasing. Mr. O'Connor then announced a three pronged drive by SIPTU to tackle pension under provision at workplace level for private sector workers, nationally on behalf of lower paid public sector workers and centrally through stepping up its campaign to have the contributory old age pension increased to 34% of average industrial earnings. I understand the Minister has confirmed that the Central Statistics Office will shortly be able to give us an up to date assessment of the current coverage of occupational pensions.</P>
    <P>In this context, the basic outline of the personal retirement savings accounts in Part 2 of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001, is an attractive development. This contract based product between an individual and a PRSI provider in the form of an investment account has the potential to be a long-term personal retirement vehicle to enable people to save for retirement in a flexible manner. The new section 92 of the Principal Act gives a vital role to the Pensions Board and the Revenue Commissioners in the approval and supervision of PRSA products. I share some of the concerns raised by Deputy Brian Hayes regarding multiple regulators. Not alone will the pensions board and the Revenue Commissioners be involved, the Central Bank will be involved through the licensing of companies.</P>
    <P>The stipulation that the PRSA provider is required to have a default investment strategy for each of its products is very welcome, as is the requirement that the provider must be certified by the PRSA actuary. The concept of a simple, accessible, off the shelf, standard PRSA should be very helpful for potential savers. The litany of complaints about charges on insurance products, especially front-loaded charges, is well addressed by the charges provisions in Part 2 which cap charges at 5% of contributions and 1% per annum of the assets. I have noted concern from brokers concerning the absence of charges for transfers between PRSAs. Perhaps those concerns might be explored on Committee Stage. In the past this House has been alarmed at irregularities in the churning of insurance policies and it would be important not to allow an attraction for the continual transfers between PRSAs.</P>
    <P>The flexibility to transfer between PRSA providers, to suspend and reactivate premium payments, and for employees to take PRSAs with them when changing jobs should be conducive to the take up of the new product. While anybody will be able to make contributions to PRSAs irrespective of employment status, the obligation on employers who do not provide an occupational pension scheme to provide access to at least one standard PRSA is a valuable condition. These are valuable gains and I commend the Minister and his staff for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" />The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs told the Seanad last year that if the proposed PRSA arrangements on a voluntary basis provided under Part 2 do not work that the incumbent Minister would then review the necessity for mandatory provisions. He has restated that today. In this, the Minister followed the prescriptions of the NPPI report. He referred to a review period shorter than five years. Surely the huge gap in second pillar provision, especially in the private sector, needs the remedy of mandatory occupational pensions. Even at this stage, why did the Minister not insist on employers making contributions into employee PRSAs? Top managers in the private sector have long regarded pension compensation as a key element of salary conditions. Surely this Bill presented the Minister with a unique opportunity to be radical and constructive by making PRSAs mandatory for both sides of business and for including employers' contributions. I note the obligation of the employer to provide access and pay and remit contributions to at least one type of standard PRSA. There is no obligation on the employer to make contributions of any kind. We should consider that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the other provisions of Part 2, including the disclosure requirements on PRSAs from section 111 onwards, the preliminary disclosure certificates, the annual statements of reasonable projections, the six month statement, the annual report and the certain disclosures before transfer from occupational pension schemes to PRSAs. Key functions of the board will include the registration database of PRSA asset statistics. The performance of the board in the maintenance and monitoring of these issues will have an important bearing on how PRSAs perform and are taken up.</P>
    <P>Yet I am not certain if these provisions will remove widespread dissatisfaction with levels of disclosure in existing pensions funds. Like Deputy Brian Hayes, I noted how graphically Senator Ross, who is experienced in this field, berated the pensions industry during the debate on this in the Seanad. He said there was no transparency in the industry and that seems to be the case. We might know the geographical breakdown of funding in certain stocks, but there is no provision in this Bill for PRSA contributors to know exactly where their money is held. I presume, like current occupational funding and other pension and investment products, a general annual report will be provided by the provider saying how the product has done, but we will not be told precisely what we are investing in. Senator Ross made the point that many of these funds should not have been in equities, even before the disaster in the United States on 11 September, but should rather have been largely moved into cash and property. It seems pension fund managers do not have an absolute standard against which their performance is measured. I share the view that perhaps their internal returns should be based on the return of the fund itself. <Col N="829" /> They should receive returns in line with their ability to protect the assets of contributors. I do not think this major issue has been addressed in the safeguards that are in Part 2. The deadline for the special savings accounts is approaching. It is possible that there will be confusion between those and the PRSAs.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom, the stakeholder pension has been in operation since 8 October 2001. Sections in Part 2 of the Bill are modelled on the stakeholder pension. All the reports I have read show serious disappointment that the target low income groups, earning between £5,000 sterling and £20,000 sterling, have not found the stakeholder pensions to be attractive. There has been a perception that the take-up of stakeholders comes primarily from the better off who use the funds to store cash for their children and earn the maximum tax relief. That is the reason commentators like Will Hutton, the former editor of the <i>Observer</i> and chief executive of the Industrial Society, feel further reform of the UK pension system is urgently needed &ndash; especially for those on lower incomes. He said: &ldquo;If we are to ask individuals to incur more market risk, we must at least make sure that the structure and mechanisms in which they take these risks is as copper-fastened as possible.&rdquo; He is voicing the same concerns as Senator Ross. The same conclusions on PRSA type products have been arrived at by commentators in Britain and America. They have found that the rich are more able to avail of financial advice, can afford to take risks, and their take up of such products is significantly higher. There is a deep concern that the stakeholder pension, because of the administration concerns, may turn out to be a lottery ticket under current British legislation.</P>
    <P>Similar anxieties exist regarding the attractiveness of these schemes to better off people and the lack of attraction to those with little money to invest have also been voiced by the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice. They are gravely concerned that the tax expenditure in income forgone in occupational pensions in 1997, including the PRSAs, was estimated at &euro;822 million or two-thirds of direct expenditure provision at that time. They quote the ESRI report that shows the take-up of occupational schemes in the top five or six deciles of the population is extremely high, whereas there is hardly any take-up at all in the lower deciles. The Jesuits have proposed the radical solution of giving the highest tax relief to the poorest people and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
    <P>I welcome the innovation of the Pensions Ombudsman in Part 3, section 5, and the outline of his powers in the new section 131, in relation to those who suffer financial loss by an act of maladministration. I also welcome the powers given to make a determination, refer matters for final judgment to the High Court and to make an award for financial loss, even if it is capped at the rate of benefit a person would have had.</P>
    <P>The key problem the Labour Party has with the provisions on the ombudsman &ndash; and I know that <Col N="830" /> the Minister accepted amendments in the Seanad &ndash; is the time limit, six years from the date on which the person becomes aware or ought to have been aware of an act giving rise to a complaint. The ombudsman would have more discretion if he could decide that there were reasonable grounds for a longer time limit. The problem for many pensioners will be the provision that prior to establishment, there is an absolute limit of six years on the ombudsman's ability to address a case.</P>
    <P>I have received many representations on this issue and, like other Deputies, have been contacted by pensioners who felt hard done by during my time in the Dáil. I represented many of the Irish Press Group pensioners who were dissatisfied with the operation of the number two fund and believed that it was seriously under-funded by management. I also represented some of the Ford motor workers who had a serious problem with the management of the surplus. There is no reference in the Bill to that type of problem.</P>
    <P>One of the most poignant cases I encountered was that of the 75 members of the Tara Disabled Mineworkers Association, who were forced to give up work because of work related injuries. They were covered by Norwich Union for the continuance of their income, and the company continued to pay their contributions, rising to 5% per annum, into their pension funds. However, the company told them that when they reached 65, they would not get an equivalent income plus 5% for each year, because the company had frozen their salaries at the time of their disability. This meant that often their salaries were frozen for 20 years at a time when wages were low. This is typical of a number of unsatisfactory schemes which have disturbed people and for which there is no provision in this Bill. Therefore, we should return on Committee Stage to the question of the time limit and the ombudsman's independence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other aspects of the ombudsman's remit to investigate. I also welcome Part 4, and the fact that the Minister in section 10 extends coverage to include employees covered by the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001. I commend his taking this important step. I also welcome the improvements to sections 17 and 18 for preserved benefit and defined benefit schemes, and the implementation of the mobility directive in section 26. I welcome the increased powers in section 36 to require disclosures, but I am not sure they go far enough in relation to the performance of elements of a fund.</P>
    <P>Sections 47 to 49 are important for the issue of whistle-blowers as most of us in this House know about the performance of funds from pensioners or, occasionally, from trustees. It is disappointing that provision is not made for the extension of the board's size and composition under section 50 to include direct representatives of pensioners and more representation of consumers. It is interesting to note, too, that there is an age limit <Col N="831" /> on the ombudsman, considering that we are dealing with pensions.</P>
    <P>The Bill totally ignores many serious public sector issues, such as parity. We get complaints from constituents in Dublin and Cork, in particular, about the Government's broken promises on parity. Together with Dublin city Labour Party representatives, Deputies Seán Ryan, Shortall and McDowell, I attended a mass meeting of Aer Lingus&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, we are back. At that meeting of about 500 Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensioners, the Government was bitterly attacked for refusing to index their pensions and for four or five years of consultation with no result. I was happy to have a commitment for them from our spokesperson, Deputy McDowell, that, given the strength of the case presented by them, and the obvious injustice and inequity that these members suffered, the Labour Party is resolved to rectify and remove the anomaly between the pensions of these members and that of other comparable pensioners.</P>

      <P>Our party has given an absolute guarantee that we will restore the index value of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta pensions.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the serious issue of semi-State bodies and other issues raised by the Commission on Public Service Pensions are not addressed. For example, the distinguished Senator and trade unionist, Senator O'Toole, did not sign the commission's majority report because he feared the Government would abandon deferred benefit pensions for the public service, something the Labour Party will oppose.</P>
      <P>I commend the staff of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who have worked extremely hard, led by Miss Vaughan and regret that the Minister is guillotining such a valuable, important Bill. I welcome the provisions on the PRSAs, with the caveats I outlined, and the ombudsman. We will attempt to introduce some amendments on that office on Committee Stage, when the Minister returns from the Far East. We will also attempt to amend the composition and strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board. Society needs a comprehensive view of all pension provision &ndash; private, occupational and State. I recall from my days teaching economics that it was the World Bank which expounded the three pillars and I am glad the Minister is strengthening the second one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity, given the many changes, that the Minister would not call it a day and admit failure. Having regard to what my colleague just said, I am surprised the Minister has <Col N="832" /> not decided to call in an outside expert, which is one of the Bill's basic provisions. He did not even come up with this idea since the inspiration came from the PPF. I am not sure the Bill adequately covers the issues that caused problems previously. I presume that as the Bill deals with employment-related pensions, the Minister cannot raid the funds, as has happened in the past to other funds which were set aside for a specific purpose. In his reply, no doubt, the Minster will spend some time telling us he is not going to do that and that no amendment will be introduced to allow him to make withdrawals from a private pension fund in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The issue of 2038 has been discussed for several years. That is something we knew we had to plan for and it presents a major opportunity at this time, which I hope will work, but I want to raise a number of matters which have caused me concern over the years. Will there be a provision for equal entitlement in respect of equal contributions and will that entitlement apply in all cases thereafter? Many pension schemes operate in this city to which people make contributions on a yearly basis but from which they cannot draw benefit. I can think of one that applies to a number of semi-State companies whereby the next of kin of a single person, in the event of death, does not receive death benefit because he or she is not a spouse. That has been the case for a long time and it applies to a number of fairly substantial firms. It is an unfair element in the whole pensions process.</P>
      <P>I hope similar pension schemes will not be created in the future because if a contribution is being made either directly by the employee or on his or her behalf by the employer, the participant or his or her next of kin should get whatever benefit accrues. There are specific exclusions to that general principle in operation of which I am sure the Minister and his staff are aware.</P>
      <P>During my brief time in the Department I came up with a proposal that a certain sum would be set aside on an annual basis to supplement either private or, if necessary, public pension funds at some stage in the future since the social welfare fund was showing a modest but consistent surplus. That was a good idea and I understand it has been taken up in other areas, although I am not sure the original intentions are still to the fore &ndash; only time will tell what will be the result of that. What concerns me more, however, is whether we can be certain that regardless of the economic factors that may intervene in the meantime, we can be assured that under no circumstances will any Government authority be in a position to raid the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to move on to the next area about which the contributors might have concern. What will happen to the pension fund? Who will protect it? Will it be invested in such a way as to ensure that the contributors receive the maximum benefit and the managers receive a fee, not necessarily a major proportion of the fee because what is of importance is the benefit to the consumer? The <Col N="833" /> people who are in the business of providing such services may question whether such a suggestion is accurate but from my dealings with individual cases, I believe it is accurate. One could spend some time arguing with managers about the precise benefits that should accrue based on the information made available to the subscriber originally and the benefits which ultimately accrue to the person or his or her next of kin. That is an issue on which I would like to hear further clarification from the Minister in due course.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Broughan's concerns about rushing the Bill through the House just before a break. The Bill was published last July. Why did we have to wait until now to see it brought before the House?</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the question of the pensions ombudsman. Many people have welcomed this provision. It is welcome in some respects but I hope it does not turn out to be a cop-out for ministerial responsibility at some stage in the future because until Ministers have clearly defined responsibilities which they are prepared to stand over, the consumer and the community will not get the best possible service. The cop-out factor is alive and well. Various ombudsmen and other people have been appointed to do the job the Government used to do. Having handed over the responsibility to well-meaning individuals who were given grand offices and good salaries, to which they are entitled, the people who have been appointed by the public to represent them have no responsibilities. They can career around the countryside opening pubs, shopping centres etc. Essentially, they can make announcements outside the House which in turn erodes the ethos of the House, public confidence in it and the whole democratic process.</P>
    <P>There is more and more erosion from this House of the responsibilities and duties that were thrust upon its Members by the people. We hear complaints about members of the public not voting and ridiculous explanations as to the reason they do not want to vote. They do not want to vote because they do not believe this House represents them. They no longer believe that Ministers represent them because the responsibilities given to them when they were elected by the people are given to somebody else who is unelected. That is crazy, and Governments and Ministers must recognise there is a price to be paid if they go down that road. I have spoken on this subject previously in the House, as have many other Members.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the ombudsman to have access to some independent arbitrator. If decisions which should be taken by Ministers at some time in the future are passed over to a person with other responsibilities, the question will arise as to whether Ministers are elected to Government for any useful purpose. That will become more obvious as time goes on. I do not want to cite all the other cases where similar problems may arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" />I mentioned the need to protect pension funds generally. I compliment the Pensions Board on its innovative work over recent years and for recognising the need to change with the times and that what is provided for now may not be what is needed in ten or 15 years' time. Provision of extra resources to benefit the consumer in the period when pension funds mature is important. The Pensions Board has done that effectively and I hope it will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the 20 wealthiest countries in the world &ndash; we may even be in the top ten. However, we are becoming more selfish and that selfishness manifests itself even more as we get wealthier. That is sad but it is a fact of life. In those circumstances, the people who are most likely to suffer are the very young, those who are retired and the elderly. It is important to make provision for the people who are likely to be affected in the rush if and when the shutters come down. Times will not always be good and everyone will look to protect themselves. Those who are stuck on a limited or fixed income are the most likely to suffer and to have to make sacrifices. That should be borne in mind at this stage and it should continue to be borne in mind by the Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the short time available for this debate. On an issue that is as broadly based as this and that affects the lives of many people in our society, I would have thought the Bill in its Second Stage format would have been before the House for at least a month. That is the way business used to be done in this House before we became slick and got access to high technology, which it was suggested would enable things to be done better. However, it seems to be at the expense of adequate debate. The Bill has been debated in the Seanad and I am not suggesting the other House was deficient in its deliberations, but it should also be before this House in adequate time.</P>
    <P>This provision will change the current position where 50% of the workforce is covered to ensure that 70% of it is covered. I am not clear why the provision covers 70% of the workforce. I presume the idea is to ensure 100% of the workforce will be covered. In the same way as people need health cover, they also need pension cover. I presume this is an interim objective and a step in the process rather than an end in itself.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to talk to a young person about investing in a pension fund. A 25 year old has other priorities and one can understand that. It is important that everyone should recognise the importance of focusing on this issue in the first instance rather than deciding at the age of 45 or 50 that one should take out a pension when it will cost more. The pension providers will gain more, but the contributors will get less benefit for their contribution at that age.</P>
    <P>I would like to be assured that this proposal will be progressive and that the intention is to include all the workforce at some stage. All the workforce should be insured in some shape or <Col N="835" /> fashion. I hope when that comes about there will be a greater degree of recognition of responsibility by young people than there was in the past.</P>
    <P>I compliment the various employment sectors that specifically set out to provide pension funds for their employees over the years. Some sectors did so to a greater extent than others. Some schemes are good and have provided cover for people in their retirement which they can well do with. If there had not been that foresight 40 years or 50 years ago, many people would not have cover and would have to depend entirely on a basic social welfare pension or a means tested social welfare pension.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong the debate other than to say that the pension business, including management of pension funds and the determination of benefits for subscribers, in future will achieve a greater deal of importance than it did in the past because of demographic changes. With the ever increasing burden of more and more people reaching retirement age and requiring assistance through the pension funds, this will put a greater strain not only on the pension funds but on administrators, the Government and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This must be borne in mind on an ongoing basis with specific reference to planning ahead. If planning is done well in advance, there will not be any difficulty. I do not accept the notion about a serious problem arising in the year 2038, provided that there is adequate forward planning.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will address some of the issues I raised. I also hope that in future similar Bills will be introduced on time and that the debate on them will be longer. I hope the provisions in this Bill are not the forerunner of a number of other provisions to enable Government to opt out of responsibilities in a particular area by handing them over to useful bodies and, in so doing, avoid accountability to the Houses of Parliament for what happens afterwards. The Houses of Parliament need to assert their authority and take responsibility and there must be recognition among the general public that the Houses of Parliament are accountable and the public should hold them to account.</P>

        <b>: </b>I welcome the Bill in that it looks after the people who will retire in the future. The case was made by previous speakers along those lines. My brief contribution will deal with the past. I am sure the Minister of State would know what I am talking about when I outline the problem faced by some people. I would like the ombudsman to be able to deal with matters that occurred in the past without any time restriction coming into play. The ombudsman is confined to six years in this respect, but no time limit should apply. Pensioners, some of whom are retired ten years or longer, who were wronged or feel they have cases to be answered, cannot appeal to the ombudsman to handle their cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" />The Minister of State might be aware of the case concerning retired members of a former semi-State company, the Irish Sugar Company, which has been ongoing for many years. In particular, they have a grievance about the clawback provision where they were allowed to pay PRSI and to pay into their pension fund, which has millions of euro in reserve. They contributory pension was deducted from their funds. Having paid into their private pension fund and having been allowed to pay PRSI, it was unjust that the company was able to deduct the State pension from their company pension. Those people have a valid case. The clawback provision has been reduced to the deduction of half of the State pension.</P>
    <P>Those people who retired many years ago, who made up that company and contributed so much, deserve to get back their money and to be treated fairly while they are still alive. I ask the Minister of State to deal with their case. He is about to leave and to be replaced by another Minister. The wheels of fortune go around in a big way. What will happen to the huge surplus in that fund in that company? Will it be put into another fund or will it be raided? I want answers to those questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. I want to deal with some of the issues raised. Deputies Hayes and Broughan asked why the compulsory approach was not adopted. The unanimous view of the NPPI report was that a voluntary rather than a mandatory system should be implemented. That included the trade unions. The trade union representatives on the board were of the view that we should proceed on a voluntary rather than a mandatory basis. As I said earlier, we will keep a close eye on this as it proceeds. In the event of the cover not being as it should be, we would look at the mandatory approach.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes raised the issue of the review of coverage over a number of years. We are of the view that sooner rather than later there will be a requirement to monitor the situation but I will undertake to look at the Deputy's proposal regarding specific targets for coverage on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>On the question of tax provisions, Deputy Hayes said its complexity was of concern to him. At the end of the day, people want to know what tax relief they will get on their pension contribution, when they can take their benefits and what benefits they can expect on reaching retirement. There are different types of pensions and we have to deal with that situation, but obviously we cannot deal with it in this Bill. We cannot abolish other types of pension coverage which are working well. That is one of the reasons we tried to amend the Bill, as published, to ensure there would not be massive transfers from one type of pension to PRSAs.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the ERSI study and the recent paper by the Centre for Faith and Justice. At the end of the day, the driving force behind pensions is the issue of tax relief. Reducing the tax relief, or removing it in come cases, as suggested in some of the proposals would take away the incentive to save over a long period and would be contrary to the objective of the PRSAs which is designed to increase the coverage. The Centre for Faith and Justice suggested giving the lower earners higher tax relief and the higher earners lower tax relief. I am informed this would lead to very severe practical difficulties in implementing such a scheme. Much pension relief is given under the net pay arrangement &ndash; the employer applies tax to the pay, net of contributions. This encourages deduction at source. Such a scheme could not operate at varying rates. While in principle the paper from the Centre for Faith and Justice could be logical, its implementation from a practical point of view would not be sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of the ombudsman. There is a difference between the ombudsman, as proposed in the Bill, and the insurance ombudsman which is a private arrange<Col N="838" /> ment within that industry. The amendments made in the Seanad extended the time limit. They have also extended the scope of the time limit by introducing a reference to the date on which the complainant became aware, or ought to have become aware, of the action. That is analogous with the situation in relation to bringing actions under normal civil law. From the point of view of having no time limit, the strong advice to me is that that would mean the ombudsman would not be in a position to look at the present or the future because his office would be so inundated with requests for investigations going back over many decades. In effect, it would clog up the office and make the work of the ombudsman's office very difficult in the first few years. Under the establishment of the public service ombudsman, there was no provision for retrospection. There is provision for retrospection in this case and we have gone further than in the original Bill which proposed three years &ndash; it is now six years.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hayes and Broughan raised the issue of the UK stakeholder pension. One cannot compare the stakeholder pension with our own because there are a number of differences. That pension was tagged on to an incredibly complex pension edifice in the UK. In Ireland there has been a clear direction and the social partners have been involved under the national pension policy initiative. Those who take out PRSAs do so with confidence knowing that the structures being put in place by means of this legislation will not be radically changed. There may be nuances in relation to it being mandatory or voluntary into the future or in relation to better coverage. The general policy direction as agreed by the social partners will be continued for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The issue of monitoring employers to ensure they provide the access to PRSAs without delay was raised by a number of Deputies. My Department will look closely at this issue as we move forward when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The question of pension scheme surpluses was raised by Deputy Broughan. All the schemes are voluntary arrangements between the employer and the employee. At the end of the day there is a trust deed and trustees. In effect, they are trustees. The less the State intervenes in those private arrangements the better, while at the same time encouraging as much cover as possible. In relation to the occupational pension scheme, we looked at the question of indexation into the future of these. We have made a number of changes in the past few years. For schemes that do not provide for indexation the Bill proposes a mandatory review by trustees in relation to the possibility of indexing pensions. The outcome of this review and the employer's response, which are required by the rules of the scheme, must be published in their annual report.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage and thank Deputies for their forbearance. I am delighted there is all-party agreement that this Bill be passed before the dissolution of this Dáil and I <Col N="839" /> thank Deputies for assisting in that respect. I look forward to Committee Stage where perhaps we will have a look at some of the net issues. Some amendments were made in the Seanad and I hope a clean Bill can be agreed by all sides. We can elaborate on the matter on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal system is central to the notion of what it means to be part of a civilised society, as it has an impact on the lives of all citizens. Key elements of the system, including the courts and the Judiciary, have served this country well. Needs and expectations change over time, however, and provisions in successive courts Acts reflect the demands and pressures on the legal <Col N="840" /> system. Unsurprisingly, the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001, also reflects an awareness of the need to reshape certain elements of the system and to change our approach in certain key areas. It contains a number of measures relating to the legal system, some more wide-ranging than others. The measures cover three broad areas, the Judiciary, the courts and the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>Turning first to the Judiciary, Deputies will recall that the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, made solicitors of ten years' standing eligible for appointment as Circuit Court judges. This was seen at the time as an innovative step as it was perceived that such judges would bring valuable insights to the Circuit Court, given the particular role solicitors play in the legal system. In a further reforming measure, Circuit Court judges of four years' standing were allowed to become eligible for appointment to the High Court or the Supreme Court. In effect, therefore, an indirect mechanism was provided whereby solicitors appointed to the Circuit Court bench might, over time, ultimately serve on the bench of both courts.</P>
    <P>Given the fundamental role played by the Judiciary in our legal system, it is not surprising that the pace of change in this area should be gradual and incremental in nature. Having said that, the debate on the 1995 Act focused attention on the question of qualifications for appointment as judges of the High and Supreme Courts and a working group was subsequently established to consider the matter. A key recommendation of the group was that suitably qualified solicitors should be eligible for direct appointment to the Supreme and High Courts. The Government had no hesitation in accepting the recommendation and one of the factors, among many, which influenced the decision was the contribution made by solicitors appointed as Circuit Court judges under the 1995 Act.</P>
    <P>It would not be an exaggeration to say that Part 2 of this Bill contains one of the central policy elements in this legislation, namely, that practising solicitors of not less than 12 years' standing should be eligible for direct appointment to the High and Supreme Courts. Over time, this provision should widen the pool of suitable candidates for appointment to the superior courts. The greater diversity in profile which may result will enrich further the judicial bench. It is of crucial importance in this context that solicitors are willing to exercise the general right of audience before the superior courts which they have had since the enactment of the Courts Act, 1971. In the absence of such a willingness and given the nature of the new provisions I am introducing, those provisions will be largely devoid of effect.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate to have a Judiciary which is respected for its integrity, fairness and independence and my Government colleagues and I do not wish to see this position compromised by a complacent belief that the system in place at any given time is good enough for all times. With that in mind, this Bill contains certain new provisions <Col N="841" /> relating to the manner in which the eligibility for appointment of candidates for judicial office is assessed. The Bill also provides for public scrutiny of the manner of such assessments.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that to provide for increased clarity in the manner in which judges are appointed, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, established the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. A key function of the board is to recommend to the Government the names of persons suitable for appointment as judges. While the advice of the JAAB cannot be binding on the Government for constitutional reasons, the Government has direct regard to the names recommended in advising the President on the appointment of a judge and it is a matter of record that all appointments made to date have come from the recommended list.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the JAAB has an important task in making its recommendations. Accordingly, in line with the incremental approach which I referred to earlier, additional elements of transparency and accountability are being introduced into its procedures. Section 10 of the Bill provides that the JAAB will make an annual report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The report will set out details of the board's activities and performance of its functions. It may include information relating to the number of persons considered by the board for appointment to the various judicial offices in the period concerned and the gender, professional qualifications and experience of those people and those appointed to judicial office. The report may also include information relating to the procedures used by the board for examining applications and the criteria used by the board to select persons to recommend to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an important safeguard relating to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board's report. Steps will be taken to ensure that the report will not include information which discloses or could disclose the identity of persons considered by the board in relation to appointment to judicial office, but who were not appointed. Section 7 of the Bill gives a new responsibility to the JAAB, specifying that when recommending a person for appointment to the superior courts, the board should hold the opinion that the person has an appropriate knowledge of the decisions of the superior courts and an appropriate knowledge and experience of the practice and procedures of the courts. The JAAB will have particular regard to the nature and extent of the person's practice in so far as it relates to his or her personal conduct of proceedings in the Supreme and High Courts. The conduct of proceedings, which is under scrutiny, can be as an advocate, as a solicitor instructing counsel, or both. These provisions simplify considerably the recommendations of the working group on judges' qualifications which, on closer examination, were seen to be needlessly complicated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" />The working group placed considerable reliance on the fact that litigation experience in the superior courts, based on whether a solicitor is regularly engaged in the conduct of relevant proceedings, should be a condition precedent to appointment. The rigorous scrutiny to which the various recommendations of the working group were subject during the course of the drafting process suggested that this concept could give rise to uncertainty about the appointment of solicitor judges and result in any such appointments being vulnerable to challenge in the future. The Bill now proposes to make relevant litigation experience a matter about which the JAAB should form an opinion before recommending an applicant as eligible for appointment. Notwithstanding the departures from some of the working group's recommendations, I am deeply grateful to members of the group for their work and for the time they devoted to their deliberations. Without their thoroughness and diligence, it would have been more difficult to develop many of the proposals in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>One point the working group noted is that an increasing number of practising barristers or solicitors change from one profession to the other mid-career. The working group recommended that such persons should be entitled to rely on cumulative relevant professional experience to meet the eligibility criteria for appointment to the superior courts. Section 6 of the Bill provides for this recommendation and also provides that cumulative relevant professional experience may be reckoned in meeting the eligibility criteria for appointment to the Circuit and District Courts.</P>
    <P>The number of judges available to hear cases at any one time is always a matter of controversy. Conscious of the need for increased resources in this area, I put proposals to Government in the last year or so to legislate for an increase in the number of ordinary judges of the High Court. In making these proposals to Government, I had regard to the fact that a number of judges are engaged in valuable duties with tribunals or commissions of inquiry. Furthermore, Mr. Justice Quirke is undertaking significant work with the Public Service Benchmarking Body and Mr. Justice Smith has recently been appointed as chairperson of the Standards in Public Office Commission. I also took account of the views of the former President of the High Court that the workload of that court is such that an acceptable service cannot be provided to litigants with the current number of judges.</P>
    <P>The number of cases being set down for hearing, particularly in the area of criminal law, has risen dramatically in recent years. High Court business has been further increased by the introduction of additional areas of litigation such as Criminal Assets Bureau cases. Some significant and lengthy trials in the Special Criminal Court have made it more difficult for the President of the High Court to provide an efficient service for the hearing of other cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" />Irish law supports the right to an early trial and the prohibition of proceedings where there has been an undue delay by the State which may prejudice the chance of a fair trial. The needs of litigants involved in civil and commercial cases also have to be acknowledged. Having considered my proposals, the Government approved the preparation of legislation for an increase in the number of ordinary judges of the High Court. At present, there are 24 such judges. The Government's decisions provide for an increase of two in this number, bringing the maximum number of ordinary judges to 26.</P>
    <P>Legislative effect is given in section 25 of the Bill to the initial Government decision to increase the number of ordinary judges of the High Court to 25. I will introduce an amendment to section 25 of the Bill on Committee Stage to take account of the further decision of the Government, which was taken after the Bill was published, that the number of ordinary judges of the High Court should be 26.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government recently decided to appoint three additional judges to the Circuit Court to facilitate the work of the tribunal chaired by Mr. Justice Flood. In order to give effect to the decision, I will introduce a Committee Stage amendment which will increase the number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court from 27 to 30. In addition, I will also introduce an amendment to provide for an increase in the number of ordinary judges of the District Court from 50 to 52 and to provide that there may be up to 14 unassigned judges &ndash; the statutory limit is 12 at present. Enhanced pension arrangements for Mr. Justice Morris, who has agreed to chair the tribunal of inquiry into the allegations of misconduct on the part of certain members of the Garda Síochána in Donegal, will also be made by way of amendment to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Continuing on the theme of the rights of citizens to easier access to the courts and to the speedy resolutions of matters brought before the courts, section 11 of the Bill provides that a judge appointed to a higher court may complete any partly heard cases which he or she may have been hearing in the lower court. This measure will apply particularly in the case of Circuit Court judges appointed to the High Court. At present, when a Circuit Court judge is appointed to the High Court, any cases which he or she may not have heard completely are transferred to another judge of the Circuit Court Bench and completely reheard. In terms of continuity and the duration of the case, this may be a source of concern for all parties. I consider that this measure, which will not cause any undue disruption of the work of the higher court, is a sensible one which addresses the needs of those most significantly involved in any case, namely, the litigants.</P>
    <P>On a separate issue regarding judicial appointments, section 4 of the Bill ensures that a judge of the European Court of Human Rights will be eligible for appointment to the superior courts in <Col N="844" /> the same way as, for example, a judge of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Section 9 of the Bill clarifies certain administrative arrangements which are relevant where a person such as a judge of the Court of Justice is being appointed to judicial office by the President.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in section 4 for Circuit Court judges of not less than two years' standing to be eligible for appointment to the superior courts, replacing the existing provision where such judges have to be of four years' standing to be eligible. Ten years' service as a barrister or solicitor is required for appointment as a Circuit Court judge. The ten years plus two years arrangement envisaged in this section has a certain symmetry with the arrangements for appointment as a judge of the superior courts in so far as practising barristers or solicitors are concerned in that there is a 12 year practice requirement incumbent on such persons. A new element in respect of the latter which is imposed by the Bill is that the requirement of 12 years' practice for barristers and solicitors who wish to be considered for appointment as a judge of the superior courts must include a continuous period of practice of not less than two years immediately before such appointment.</P>
    <P>County Registrars who have practised as barristers or solicitors for not less than ten years prior to their appointment are already eligible for appointment as District Court judges. Under the provisions of section 5 of this Bill, such county registrars will now be eligible for appointment as Circuit Court judges. The opportunity has also been taken in section 5 to simplify the eligibility provisions regarding the appointment of District Court judges to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to matters which are, perhaps, more germane to the way in which the courts carry out the business of administering justice. It is evident that ever increasing numbers of people are using our courts on a daily basis. I mentioned earlier the citizen's right of access to justice. This right is recognised in the significant increases in the monetary jurisdictions of the Circuit and District Courts in the matters of contract, tort and related jurisdictions. The current jurisdictions of the Circuit and District Courts were set in 1991. The increases now provided for are from £5,000 to &euro;20,000 in the case of the District Court and from £30,000 to &euro;100,000 in the case of the Circuit Court. The Government considers that the jurisdictional amounts provided for in the Bill are realistic levels which are appropriate to today's society.</P>
    <P>The fact that cases can now be taken at a lower level than hitherto should mean that all parties will incur reduced costs. This is good for individual litigants and the State where the latter is party to an action. The District and Circuit Courts are located conveniently around the country. Therefore, it is not just legal costs which will be affected. If, as expected, the proposals in the Bill lead to a substantial transfer of actions from the <Col N="845" /> High Court to the lower courts, there will, in addition to the greater convenience, also be savings in matters such as travelling expenses for litigants and witnesses. These proposals will facilitate reductions in the real cost of litigation.</P>
    <P>The increased jurisdiction levels are provided for in sections 12 and 13 of the Bill. Sections 14 to 17, inclusive, provide for amendments to other enactments which are necessary to reflect the increased levels. The increased jurisdiction levels proposed for the Circuit Court and District Court are in keeping with Government initiatives in the area of ease of access to justice generally. The Government has decided to establish a statutory board &ndash; the personal injuries assessment board &ndash; to decide issues of quantum in personal injuries arising from employers' liability and motor insurance claims. The Government has also established the State Claims Agency to apply best commercial practice to the management of certain personal injury and property damage claims against the State with the objective of ensuring that such claims are resolved fairly, expeditiously and economically.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Courts Act, 1991, allows the Government to revise, by order, the monetary limits of the lower courts having regard to the value of money generally since the limits were previously revised. The legislative provision for an increase in the jurisdiction levels of the lower courts which I am proposing today does not affect the provisions of the 1991 Act.</P>
    <P>On a related jurisdictional matter, sections 18 to 20, inclusive, of the Bill provide for increases in the jurisdiction of the courts where certain family law matters are concerned. Essentially, these relate to maintenance payments and certain responsibilities incurred in the event of the birth or death of a child. Again, the increased jurisdiction levels provided for in the Bill are appropriate to and reflective of today's society and cost of living. These increases will assist many deserted spouses in obtaining substantially increased maintenance for themselves and their children under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976. A similar increase in the weekly amount that may be awarded by the District Court for the maintenance of a child under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, is also proposed.</P>
    <P>At this juncture, I wish to put Deputies on notice that I will introduce on Committee Stage an amendment to the Bill which will amend the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, by increasing the upper limit at which the official assignee in bankruptcy may agree costs. The revised upper limit will be increased from £1,000 to &euro;7,000 and allow the official assignee to deal with the majority of smaller bills of costs, thus providing for a more streamlined, commercial and economic approach to costs arising out of bankruptcy procedures.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall the passage of the Valuation Act, 2001. The property valuation arrangements set out in that Act, when it enters into force on 2 May, will have implications for the <Col N="846" /> jurisdictions of the Circuit and District Courts in property matters. The Circuit Court has jurisdiction in a wide range of cases where land is the subject matter of the proceedings and the rateable valuation of that land does not exceed £200. There are also a number of family law statutes where jurisdiction is assigned to the Circuit Court on a similar basis. In many of the cases arising under those statutes the family home would be the main asset at issue. The District Court also has a certain family law jurisdiction where the rateable valuation does not exceed £20. An assessment of the jurisdiction requirements in property matters is being undertaken by officials of my Department and the Courts Service, the outcome of which will lead to further legislative provisions in the matter of jurisdiction coming before the Houses in due course.</P>
    <P>If the increases in jurisdiction provided for in the Bill are to be effective, it is essential that plaintiffs are encouraged to initiate their actions in the lowest court which has jurisdiction to hear them. This is also desirable from a social viewpoint, as otherwise litigants who are financially better off would have an advantage over poorer litigants. This policy is reflected in statutory provisions in courts legislation which generally limit the costs which a successful litigant may recover in an action to the costs appropriate to the lowest court having jurisdiction to grant the relief given.</P>
    <P>The discretion of the courts to grant costs higher than the level of costs appropriate to the lowest court having jurisdiction to grant relief is circumscribed by the Courts Act, 1981. It is proposed at section 16 of the Bill that the limits prescribed in that Act be updated in line with the monetary jurisdiction provisions contained in the Bill. Provision is made at section 17 for an increase in the award which the District Court can make in an action for unliquidated damages which may be remitted to it from the Circuit Court in certain limited instances. Again, the increases proposed are in line with the jurisdiction provisions made at sections 12 and 13.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the impact of increased jurisdiction levels in reducing court costs. Another feature of the Bill where reduction of costs is an issue is the significant provision at section 26 to change the manner in which interest is calculated on costs, charges or expenses of certain judgments, orders or decrees. At present interest on undischarged legal costs runs at 8% per annum from the date of the judgment relating to that cost. This is also the rate which applies in respect of judgment debts proper. While it is helpful that interest should apply to outstanding legal costs to encourage prompt settlement between the parties to an action, the rate of 8% per annum which applies is not appropriate given the interest rates which prevail currently in the State as a whole. In future, a nominal rate of 2% per annum will apply from the date a judgment is given to the date when the parties agree costs among themselves or until the date on which a certificate of taxation issues, whichever is appro<Col N="847" /> priate. Thereafter, the interest rate of 8% which applies to judgment debts will apply to the outstanding costs until that amount of costs is paid. Provision is also made in this section of the Bill for the 2% rate to be varied by ministerial order, having regard to the levels of interest generally in the State.</P>
    <P>The third broad area addressed in the Bill concerns the Courts Service. An independent Courts Service was provided for in the Courts Service Act, 1998, and the service itself was established on 9 November 1999. Not surprisingly, after two years' experience it has become clear that certain administrative refinements are desirable in the interests of having a more streamlined operating procedure for aspects of the service. A number of provisions in the Bill relate directly to this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Bill provides that the annual report of the Courts Service will be in respect of the preceding calendar year, rather than the 12 month period commencing on the establishment, or anniversary of establishment, of the service. The Courts Service's first and very comprehensive report was laid before the Houses last summer. For practical reasons, this report covered the period from establishment day to the end of the year 2000. All future reports will, on foot of the new statutory provision, be in respect of the relevant January to December period.</P>
    <P>The procedures for delegating within the Courts Service the authentication of particular orders or instruments are clarified at section 32. Similar clarification in relation to the determination by the Courts Service board of its functions and the delegation of those functions is made at sections 33 and 34. Section 35 explicitly permits the Courts Service board to establish committees, not just to advise it, but also to carry out certain functions of the board. Section 36 introduces some minor administrative adjustments to the existing provisions which relate to the functions of the chief executive officer of the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>Planning matters are addressed in section 37 of the Bill, which ensures the Courts Service continues to enjoy the exemption from planning permission requirements provided for in the Courts Service Act, 1998, which predated the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Section 38 concerns the expenses incurred in the provision of accommodation for High Court judges on circuit. The effect of the provision is to ensure the determination of such expenses will be a function of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, not the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are largely of a stand-alone nature. For instance, sections 28 and 29 deal with the arrangements governing membership of the various rules committees and allow for the delegation of membership in appropriate instances, while section 24 removes certain anomalies with regard to the service of Circuit Court documents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" />In section 27 there is provision for a minor adjustment to the Charities Act, 1973, to deal with problems which can arise in the case of charities established by statute where their objects are no longer relevant. The provision will allow the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests to deal with such cases in a way which is not possible at present.</P>
    <P>The brief resumé which I have given of the Bill's provisions makes it clear that, while it contains certain provisions which are of considerable importance, it also contains many provisions which are more mundane in nature. This is not controversial legislation and I hope Deputies on all sides of the House will co-operate in ensuring its speedy passage. The Bill is essentially practical legislation and I will be introducing a limited number of technical amendments to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The work of the Courts Service is dynamic and ongoing. The Chief Justice and chairperson of the Courts Service board, the Honourable Mr. Justice Keane, recently announced the establishment of a working group to examine and report on the operation and organisation of the various jurisdictions of the courts system. The working group has very wide-ranging terms of reference and will be carrying out its functions in three or more modules dealing, first, with the criminal law and, second, the civil law. I welcome the establishment of this working group and wish it every success in its deliberations. I also look forward to the presentation of its findings in due course.</P>
    <P>The key elements of the Bill are: solicitors will now be eligible for direct appointment as judges of the superior courts; there will be increased transparency and accountability in the manner in which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board operates; and the jurisdictions of the Circuit and District Courts will be increased to reflect more fully the needs of society.</P>
    <P>There is no closed list when it comes to activity in this area and, in future, it is more than likely that there will be other court related Bills containing other reforms. I mentioned, however, the incremental approach which is a feature of courts legislation. A modern and complex society such as our own, which is undergoing rapid change, places many demands on our legal structures and it is right that those structures should be examined and, if necessary, reformed to reflect the changing face of society. Nonetheless, the centrality of the justice system in our society means that we have to exercise our stewardship with care and any reforming measures must be preceded by considered debate and clear and rational analysis. That was the approach taken to some of the key provisions in the Bill. It is also the approach being taken in other areas, as evidenced by the Chief Justice's working group on jurisdiction to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the proposals contained in the Bill which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Col N="849" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased we are at last debating this legislation in the House. While the Minister did not do so, although he has been in office for a number of years, I should make the obvious declaration of interest as a member of the legal profession and a solicitor. At this stage it should not be necessary for me to do so but I nevertheless believe I should.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly says the Judiciary has served us well. It has done so since the foundation of the State. Often members of the Judiciary have been at risk because of the nature of the cases they have been called upon to determine and the circumstances in which sentences have been imposed. At all levels of the courts &ndash; the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court &ndash; there are men and women of outstanding ability who have served the State well and continue to do so. Nevertheless, it would be wrong of us not to acknowledge that people have been appointed to the Judiciary who appeared to be unable to conduct matters in the manner hoped for at the time of their appointment. However, that covers a very small minority of appointments going back to the foundation of the State. The overwhelming majority of members of the Judiciary have served us well and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome for a number of reasons. While I speak as a solicitor and a public representative, I wish to make my case without batting for any side of the legal profession. It has been my view for many years that appointments to the Judiciary need to be made from a wider and broader pool of lawyers than the current one. Originally, members of the solicitors' profession could only be appointed to the District Court. Over a number of years in this House I made the case that not only members of the solicitors' profession but legal academics should also be eligible for appointment to the Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, made provision for the appointment of members of the Circuit judiciary who were originally solicitors to the High Court after four years service in the Circuit Court. The Act also made provision for the appointment of solicitors as Circuit Court judges. That was an important reform. My party was in government and it was a matter of controversy that I sought to extend the possibility of solicitors being appointed to the High Court and the Supreme Court. The expert group, referred to by the Minister, derived from the exchanges that took place on that legislation at a time when he was Opposition spokesperson on justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group reported a considerable time ago. I welcome the fact that it is now agreed in principle that this Bill will extend the pool from which members of the Judiciary can be selected and will include the possibility that members of the solicitors' profession will be appointed to the High Court and the Supreme Court. However, I have substantial reservations about the controls and limits to be imposed and I am somewhat <Col N="850" /> alarmed at a comment made by the Minister in his speech.</P>
    <P>Should the Judicial Appointments Board make recommendations concerning the appointments of members to the Judiciary, whether dealing with solicitors or members of the Bar, section 7 provides that the board &ldquo;shall have regard, in particular, to the nature and extent of the practice of the person concerned in so far as it relates to his or her personal conduct of proceedings in the Supreme Court and the High Court whether as an advocate or as a solicitor instructing counsel in such proceedings or both.&rdquo; The Bill envisages that members of the solicitors' profession who either act as advocates in the superior courts or are regularly involved in litigation before them as solicitors instructing counsel will become eligible for appointment to the High Court and Supreme Court judiciary.</P>
    <P>However, in his speech the Minister seems to envisage curtailing at the outset the specific provisions contained in the Bill. He states:</P>
    <P>I would hope that, over time, this provision will widen the pool of suitable candidates for appointment to the superior courts and that the greater diversity and profile which may result will enrich further the judicial bench. Of course, in this context, it is of crucial importance that the solicitors are willing to exercise the general right of audience before the superior courts since they have had since the enactment of the Courts Act, 1971. In the absence of such a willingness, given the nature of the new provisions which I am now introducing, those provisions will be largely devoid of effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be already watering down the Bill. He is telling the House that only solicitors who act as advocates before the High Court and the Supreme Court will, in practice, be appointed to the judiciary of the superior courts, while solicitors who may have 12, 15, 20 or 25 years' experience in attending before the superior courts, involved in major litigation, not acting as advocates but as solicitors instructing counsel will, in practice, never be appointed. In his reply he needs to explain why he is already watering down what the Bill proposes. He also needs to tell us whether he intends to further amend the Bill in this area or whether he is simply acting on the approach he in government would adopt.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the fact that solicitors will, at least in theory, become eligible for appointment to the High Court and the Supreme Court, I regret the Minister did not take a more radical step. There is no reason eminent legal academics, who make an important input into the development of our jurisprudence and whose expertise is widely regarded and frequently relied upon by solicitors and barristers in court, should not be seen to be eligible for judicial appointments, as they are in other continental European countries. Why must we still, so many years after the State got its independence, slavishly follow the English <Col N="851" /> model? Eminent members of the United States Supreme Court have come from academic life. We are excluding a whole group of expert lawyers from eligibility for appointment as judges to our courts.</P>
    <P>Having been involved in this issue over the years, I am aware that a great deal of politics goes on between the Bar Council and the Law Society. The solicitors' profession and the Bar have been battling out this issue but the public interest demands that the determination as to who should be eligible for appointment to the Judiciary is not one to be resolved through the politics and the clashes that occur between the solicitors' profession and the bar. There is a wider public interest to be considered.</P>
    <P>There is a huge pool of fine academic lawyers in this State who have substantial expertise in Irish law. Many of them are specialists and many have greater expertise in their individual specialities than some practitioners. They would have a substantial contribution to make in the public interest in broadening the expertise of the Judiciary. I regret the Minister has not seen fit to take the more radical step and broaden the pool. It is to be regretted that, apparently, the dead hand of politics of the legal professions should determine what should happen. In saying that, I am aware that the Bar Council has fought a rearguard battle for many years against solicitors being appointed to the Judiciary. In documentation I have had made available to me under the Freedom of Information Act, interesting submissions were made by the Bar Council to the Minister in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is one note of a meeting on 19 May 2000 of the Bar Council on the courts Bill involving officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The note states that the response of the Bar Council was extremely negative with regard to the legislation the Minister intended to bring forward. The note continues &ldquo;. . . they expressed concern that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board would be overrun with solicitor applicants who were not suitable for appointment to the superior courts . . . they suggested that the risk of an unsuitable candidate being appointed would thereby be increased.&rdquo;  They were also negative about the proposal that solicitors go from employment rather than private practice directly into the court.</P>
    <P>That is from a minute of a meeting involving members of the Bar Council. It is extraordinary that members of the Bar Council should have been concerned with the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board not merely being overrun with unsuitable applicants but recommending unsuitable applicants, having regard to the fact that the board's composition is prescribed by the 1995 Act. That composition is the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court, the Attorney General, a practising barrister nominated by the Bar Council and a practising <Col N="852" /> solicitor nominated by the Law Society. The suggestion that a large number of unsuitable applicants might put such pressure on the eminent board that it would result in its producing a series of half-baked recommendations of inappropriate solicitors is one I find incredible. However, it is indicative of a certain mindset which is more concerned with protecting vested interests than the public interest.</P>
    <P>In that context I am concerned by a particular provision in this Bill which the Minister omitted to mention in detail in his speech. It is a provision which has not been adequately explained since the legislation was published in March 2001. The new provision to be inserted in the 1995 Bill is included in section 7(16)(<i>a</i>) and reads: &ldquo;The Minister shall consult with the Attorney General prior to bringing proposals before the Government in relation to the appointment of any person other than the Attorney General to a judicial office.&rdquo; That may seem an unexceptional provision but it is a rather odd one. The 1995 Act prescribes that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board will recommend seven names to the Minister for Justice of persons it recommends as appropriate to be appointed to a judicial vacancy. At present, under the 1995 Act, seven names are submitted to the Minister which he presumably brings to Cabinet where he presumably recommends one.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill seems, for no apparent reason and with no explanation, to give the Attorney General, currently Mr. Michael McDowell, a special position. It seems that after this Bill is enacted, no Minister for Justice, having received recommendations from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, will be able to go to Government with a proposal for judicial appointment unless it has first been vetted by the Attorney General and, presumably, obtained the Attorney General's agreement.</P>
    <P>The reach of the Bar Library seems to be extending into the Attorney General's office to ensure there is little or no prospect of any solicitor being appointed to the High Court or Supreme Court. I find it extraordinary that the Attorney General should be given this special position for another reason. The Attorney General is one of the people the 1995 Act appoints to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and he is involved in determining, along with the other members of the board, which seven names go to the Minister. Of course, when the Minister gets those names he is not bound by them as, under the 1995 Act, he must also be informed of other applicants who would be appropriate appointments even if they are not among the seven names recommended.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Attorney General, as a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, makes a decision and the board then makes a recommendation to the Minister but the Minister cannot go to Government without again consulting the Attorney General. Presumably that gives the Attorney General a precedence and <Col N="853" /> special position over and above the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court when it comes to making such nominations.</P>
    <P>We know the current Attorney General is a man who constantly basks in his own brilliance and never fails to announce it to everyone. However, I do not see why the present Attorney General should be put in a superior position when it comes to recommending names for judicial appointment &ndash; a position ahead of the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court. I do not know why the Minister is capitulating his position in playing the pivotal role conferred on him by the 1995 Act and is handing that role to the Attorney General. I suspect it is not unconnected with the fact that the Bar Council is still fighting a rearguard action against the appointment of solicitors to the Judiciary. Fine Gael will oppose this provision and will oppose the Bill on Second Stage for reasons I will go into.</P>
    <P>It is also disappointing that a Minister who talks about the need for transparency in the making of judicial appointments has not incorporated into the legislation a Fine Gael proposal that goes back 18 months and which was the subject of debate at the time of the Minister's ill-fated legislation dealing with disciplining members of the Judiciary. The time has come when, if the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board makes a recommendation to the Minister and seven names are in that recommendation &ndash; one of which is chosen by the Minister &ndash; we must add greater transparency to judicial appointments. If the Minister determines to recommend a name to Government, that name should be given to the Oireachtas committee on justice. If that committee deems it appropriate, it should hold whatever hearings it deems necessary to consider whether the nominee is appropriate. It should be in a position to express an opinion on that issue to the Minister and the Government and the report of the committee should be laid before both Houses. That would bring true transparency to bear on the appointment of members of the Judiciary but, sadly, that issue is not dealt with.</P>
    <P>The legislation seeks to increase the jurisdiction of the various courts. I recognise and support the idea that the financial limits imposed on the various jurisdictions of the lower courts are out of keeping with inflation and should be increased. However, it is interesting to note that the increase the Minister proposes in this legislation, in the context of general financial limits outside the family law area, is substantially in excess of the increase he originally stated he would introduce. I have particular queries about this. I recognise the value of extending the jurisdictions of the lower courts if that will reduce legal costs and that is a valuable objective. However, it will not work unless the lower courts are better resourced and have a greater capacity to conduct hearings than at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" />I refer to the way the District and Circuit Courts are currently constituted. They can barely allow more than a single day of continuous hearing for a case when it comes before them in the civil litigation area. The increase in the District Court limit is large but probably manageable in the context of the maximum limit the Minister proposes. The increase in the Circuit Court limit will prove a problem. It will result in business being transferred from the High Court to the Circuit Court, not just business which should fall within the Circuit Court jurisdiction area, but additional business that should be dealt with at High Court level.</P>
    <P>I doubt the capacity of the Circuit Court to cope with the additional volume of cases that will be transferred to it. The additional number of Circuit Court judges the Minister proposes to appoint, primarily relating to the Flood tribunal, will not ameliorate the problem. If the Minister intends to increase Circuit Court jurisdiction to the levels he proposes, he must make provision for the appointment of at least an additional five Circuit Court judges to the three he now proposes. He would also need to make additional substantial financial provision for resources to ensure the Circuit Court can properly hear and deal with these cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposed increase in the number of High Court judges is also inadequate. The increase is from 24 to 26. We need a minimum of 30 High Court judges. There is a huge and growing backlog of cases in the High Court in the civil area, while in the criminal area the current position is completely indefensible and unsustainable. The Central Criminal Court has a huge backlog of criminal cases, particularly in the area of rape and sexual offence. There are cases that will take three to four years to be heard from the date the prosecution commenced. Some cases in the court list on Monday of this week have already been two years coming to court. Due to the scarcity of High Court judges, they were put back onto the Central Criminal Court list with no prospect of being heard for another 18 months.</P>
    <P>Some young teenagers who have been sexually abused are being brought to court, with all the worries and upset that causes, expecting to give evidence in cases of sexual abuse. However, at the last minute, they are informed that their cases are postponed for 18 months. There are insufficient members of the High Court Judiciary to cope with the criminal lists and there are growing civil lists in particular areas. The extended number of judges the Minister proposes is inadequate. I urge him to amend, on Committee Stage, the reference in the Bill from 26 to 30. That would at least give the possibility of an increased High Court Judiciary even if he does not make the appointments at this stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with the area of sexual offences. In the last seven days, there have been a series of cases in which sentences that have left the public gasping in incredulity have been handed down. Judicial comments have been <Col N="855" /> made which lack insight and sensitivity. These will act as a disincentive to victims of sexual abuse reporting to the Garda or having the courage to put up with the pressures inherent in a criminal prosecution against alleged offenders.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to two cases. One is the extraordinary case that came before the High Court in which a member of the High Court Judiciary imposed a suspended sentence on the grounds that it was only rape. It was also said that the only other thing for which the convicted offender could be criticised was that, during the rape, he threatened to kill his victim. On that basis a suspended sentence was handed down. That is extraordinary and shows a frightening lack of insight. I hope the case is appealed by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the grounds of leniency.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, James Kelly, also known as Brother Ambrose, was before the court for a second time for sexual abuse. This time he was before Cork Circuit Criminal Court. He pleaded guilty to 77 offences of sexual abuse over many years. This man was previously sentenced to a huge term but, again, to the incredulity of the public, the term was dramatically reduced in a manner difficult to explain. He was sentenced previously to 34 years, but only served two and is about to be released. As this man is 76 years old and has served two different terms, previously handed down by Cork and Galway Circuit Courts for child abuse, he is to be released. This is another suspended sentence. Why? Is it because he is remorseful? This man should be locked up for life.</P>
    <P>Many of his traumatised victims, now in their adult years, find it impossible to sustain an adult relationship because of the abuse they suffered at his hands. What does it matter to them that at the age of 76 years he is remorseful? How many sexual offences does someone have to commit for the Judiciary to take the view that the offender should go to jail? People are always remorseful when they are caught. This man preyed on young people for about 40 years. The number of people he abused is almost uncountable. It is still not known whether they have all come forward. I cannot understand why such people are being dealt with in such a lenient fashion no matter how eloquent the pleas by their counsel.</P>
    <P>Another important issue is the provision of training for members of the Judiciary dealing in sensitive areas such as rape and sexual assault or family law. Some training which will ensure a degree of insight and understanding and result in the integrity of our legal system being upheld and not being brought into disrepute is necessary. In the area of sexual assault, it will ensure that victims know that if they put up with the trauma and distress of going to court, there is some possibility that justice will be done at the end if the alleged offender is convicted.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on a public interest issue. The Minister is aware I already raised this issue in connection with the Solicitors (Amendment) <Col N="856" /> Bill. It is appropriate that Deputy O'Malley started off this debate in the Chair. In 1971, under the Courts Act he introduced as Minister for Justice, solicitors were given the right of audience in our superior courts. At present, I remain one of the few solicitors who exercise that right, but others intend to do so. There are still seriously anti-competitive practices operating within our legal system which are contrary to the public interest and which make it much more expensive for people to be represented in our courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that I have tabled an amendment to the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, proposing that a provision be included in law which makes it clear that both solicitors and barristers can jointly act as advocates in presenting cases. I made that proposal because whereas solicitors can appear as advocates, and whereas the law does not prevent solicitors and barristers jointly acting as advocates, the practices and pressures that derive from the Bar Council in practice prevent junior counsel acting jointly with solicitors as advocates in cases. That is wrong. A number of solicitors in the country have particular expertise in areas of law in which they practise and they could well present cases in our higher courts. Just as we might have two senior and one junior counsel presenting a case, there are cases in which it would be appropriate that a solicitor and a junior counsel could jointly act as advocates.</P>
    <P>Although there is no legal provision in place, the Bar Council in practice prevents that happening. Over two years I have had extraordinary correspondence with successive chairmen of the Bar Council. They make it clear that this is something the Bar Council is not prepared to tolerate. Apparently the council regards it as unacceptable that any solicitor, irrespective of his or her experience, should present a case together with a junior counsel. This means that people frequently pay for too many lawyers and incur excessive and unnecessary legal costs in order to present cases in our courts.</P>
    <P>This is a point to which I will return when we discuss the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill and the Courts and Court Officers Bill. I regret the fact that the Minister has so far declined to accept my amendment despite the fact that, as he says, there is no law preventing solicitors and barristers jointly acting as advocates. He is, apparently, still acting under the instruction of the Attorney General, who takes his advice from the Bar Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here because my colleague, Deputy Howlin, has not yet arrived due to the Bill being listed for 4 p.m. I will give way to him when he arrives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the legal system has been well served and is probably central to the operation of any civil society. It affects every aspect of our daily lives and our roles as citizens. I concur with the Minister's views in that regard. I do not wish to become embroiled in the nuances of the selection and appointment of persons to <Col N="857" /> judicial positions. The calibre of the appointments made in recent years has been high. The area of greatest concern to me &ndash; I have expressed this privately at every opportunity &ndash; is the extension of jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I must indicate to the House that I am a member of the Bar; I earn my living as a barrister. I am professing my interest now in order that there should be no ambiguity about where I stand. I have no problems with the appointment of solicitors at the various courts of this land. I applaud the rights of audience. I have practised before, mainly in the Circuit Court. If I was to argue strongly in favour of what the Minister has done in relation to jurisdiction, it would be because I would stand to benefit personally. The increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court would be of tremendous benefit to me. Instead, I am arguing that the Minister has gone far too far.</P>
    <P>I have practised in the Circuit Court for 12 years and have always found that the judges there work extremely hard and put in very long hours, from the late Judge O'Malley to Judge Deery, Judge Kenny, Judge O'Leary and Judge Anthony Kennedy who works extremely long hours. Judge Carroll Moran and Judge McMahon are, like all their colleagues, very able. There is a perception that the people concerned stop work at 4 p.m., but nothing could be further from the truth. Often they work until 7 p.m. on various cases which may have a long way to run and run into second and third days. They try to accommodate the various practitioners and witnesses. They must go back to their rooms after sitting those hours and spend more hours studying various aspects of the case. They must apply legal principles and interpret the law as it applies to arguments they have heard during the course of the day. I salute them from my own experience at the midlands circuit and limited appearances in Dublin's Circuit Court and acknowledge the tremendous work and dedication of the Circuit Court judges before whom I have had the privilege of appearing. I acknowledge their hard work and the long hours they put in and that working in the country, they may be away from their homes.</P>
    <P>Very often across the various Circuit Court settings there are special sittings to accommodate cases expected to run over into a second or third day. From that perspective they are already creaking at the seams. They are not able to deal with the normal workload, yet they must accommodate special sittings. Additional, unassigned judges must be brought in to hear cases, some of which are equity matters, of which the Minister will be well aware, having been a practising solicitor for many years. Equity cases can go on for a week with injunctions and various intractable disputes. Much time must be spent on them to obtain a conclusion. Already the Circuit Court is under significant pressure. There has been a significant increase in the number of crimes which must be dealt with at Circuit Court level. Often a full week may be dedicated to criminal matters <Col N="858" /> or matters of indictment that must be tried before juries. There is also a considerable backlog of cases at that level.</P>
    <P>This does not take account of the significant increase in family law cases. The Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, the Family Law Act, 1995 and various other family law Acts introduced since then have widened the scope and capacity of the Circuit Court to deal with these matters. I appreciate the importance of this and concur with the Minister's broader view that access to the courts should be made easier. However, he will need to establish circuit family law courts across the various circuits to deal with family law matters. He has done some good work in the provision of accommodation, improvements, enhancements and refurbishments for the courts, but there are still no consultation rooms available for family law cases in some of our Circuit Court settings. This is not appropriate in this day and age.</P>
    <P>Fundamental matters are being dealt with and decisions with far reaching and wide ranging effects are being made, yet consultations take place in corridors and alleys rather than in the comfortable confines and convenience of consultation rooms. There should be a specialist family law court available across each circuit at least, because there will be an increase in the number of family law matters being heard at that level. I appeal to the Minister to provide increased resources to ensure that appropriate court accommodation and facilities are provided in this important area where various rights are determined and matters finalised in relation to children and other matters. It is important that there is confidentiality, as we have in relation to <i>in camera</i> cases, and that people have the opportunity to be consulted in private.</P>
    <P>That is an increasing area and one that will be devolved down to the Circuit Court. However, I am worried that the increase in jurisdiction is too great, as the Minister proposes to increase it from &euro;38,000 to &euro;100,000. It is correct that the figure be increased but this takes it too far. An appropriate jurisdiction would be &euro;60,000 to &euro;65,000, taking account of inflation and that there has been no amendment to that level of jurisdiction over the past ten years. I will pursue an amendment to the effect that &euro;60,000 to &euro;65,000 is the appropriate jurisdiction because otherwise a huge workload will be generated at Circuit Court level.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court is already under pressure and the Minister is now increasing the number of judges from 27 to 30. However, a number of those judges will work for a number of years at the tribunals. There is no effective increase in the number of judges who do the ordinary work, although the judges in the tribunals will do extremely important work and I acknowledge that. The official appointments were announced on 18 or 19 February and they are only being discussed today. It will be a considerable period before the legislation will be ratified by this House and the <Col N="859" /> Seanad, and before the Bill is signed by the President. Those judges will be devoted to important work at the Flood tribunal and that is why they were appointed. However, the Minister is increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court with no additional judges to deal with that increase.</P>
    <P>It is not just car accident cases that will be dealt with. There will be an increase in other areas of civil litigation such as contract cases. The Minister, as a solicitor, is well aware &ndash; as is Deputy Shatter &ndash; that contract cases can start on a Monday and still be running on a Friday. That happens even now when the limit is &euro;38,000. What will it be like when the limit is &euro;100,000? Deputy Shatter is right in that there will be a significant number of cases and the proper arena for them is the High Court. They are going down to the Circuit Court. Even though I would be one of the beneficiaries of that decision, I argue against a vested self-interest here because this measure will block up the operation of the Circuit Court. As a practitioner, I am speaking against my own interests although it is rare that somebody comes to the House to argue against what is to their benefit.</P>
    <P>I do that for the best of reasons. I am not motivated by the Bar Council. I heard Deputy Shatter refer to the council. I did not think it wielded so much clout and I do not think the Minister thought that either. I have learned something today. I must increase my contribution to the council if it is that good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to find out the views of the Minister's body in relation to the increase in jurisdiction. I think it will be a disaster although perhaps not all at the junior Bar would agree. We should look at the practicalities. Jurisdiction is being increased by more than 2.5 times the current figure. There will be a huge number of cases to be heard, including contractual cases.</P>
      <P>I am not doubting the ability of the eminent persons at Circuit Court level to hear or determine the cases. It is a question of resources. Deputy Shatter mentioned five judges being required but I respectfully disagree with him. In order for the Minister to operate this &ndash; if I am wrong about this I will be big enough to acknowledge it &ndash; it will take 15 to 18 judges. He will probably say that is mad but we must wait and see. Deputy Shatter is more expert in the family law area than I, but I still say there will be pressure and family law courts will be needed to deal specifically with that important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about injunctions? This is another area where matters can be dealt with expeditiously by <Col N="860" /> means of plenary summons and they can get into the High Court automatically. At Circuit Court level, the interlocutory application will very often be the determination of the various matters. That can take a significant period and will now be available at an increased financial level of up to &euro;100,000. I can see where the Minister is coming from in relation to the rateable valuation of property. If I am correct, he is awaiting a further evaluation of that. The 20 judges there are already overworked and will have more work to do as a result of legislation passed in the House over the past five years, under the tenure of the Minister. This measure will accentuate the difficulties. If the Minister does what he proposes, he will have to find significantly increased resources.</P>
    <P>The resources do not only concern members of the judiciary, whether solicitors or barristers appointed to the Circuit Court or District Court. Has the Minister had any communication with the unions representing personnel at this level? I have not had any and I am just wondering because it will lead to a need for more registrars, personnel, back-up staff in the courts, people dealing with orders and so on. There will be a huge demand because of that. There will be a significant amount of work and there will be staff considerations in relation to all this.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill in many ways and I have no hang-ups about it. As a member of the Bar, I welcome solicitors. The solicitors who have been appointed are very eminent people and have done a very good job. I can say that having practised in front of at least four of them who are very eminent people and who work very long hours. The solicitors are entitled to appointment to the High Court. They have had rights of audience and, as Deputy Shatter said, some of them have exercised these very well. I have no personal view here and am not advocating a particular course but I am alerting the Minister to a problem.</P>
    <P>I refer to the figure of &euro;100,000 or £78,000. Times have moved on since the figure was £30,000. Some £50,000, &euro;65,000 or thereabouts, is the correct jurisdiction which, although it will still put a strain on the current operations, is manageable. Have insurance companies sought this increase in jurisdiction? I do not think they have. We are all caught up with costs and so on. A significant element of costs arise because of the failure to deal with cases early on. There is too much toing and froing. I am a great believer in furnishing whatever reports are there early on. The Minister encouraged that through one of the statutory instruments on the disclosure of reports; I think it was S.I. No. 398 of 1997 or 1998. The exchange of reports has helped to move cases on so they can be concluded a lot sooner. That should be the case at every level. I support that and it is operating very well. Early intervention is very important to try to deal with cases as quickly as possible. A maxim we have all learned is that justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
    <P>What will happen when the Circuit Courts become snowed under? The Minister might say <Col N="861" /> that will not happen but I have no doubt that in significant cases, there will be representatives of plaintiffs and defendants, orthopaedic surgeons, actuaries, on occasion, and accountants in the Circuit Courts to prove loss of earnings and so on. There will be cases which will run a lot longer. The defendants will have to have their say and they will have engineers, actuaries, accountants, consultant surgeons, maybe neuro-physiologists or whoever depending on the nature of the injury. Evidence will have to be given in court unless there is agreement in relation to the exchange of reports. They can be handed in and taken as evidence once they are agreed. However, in their absence, all those people will have to be there. There will have to be stenographers because people will have a right of appeal. The Minister cannot limit that right nor has he sought to do so because it would not be constitutional. Instead of dealing with cases more speedily, cases will take considerably longer and they may well be the subject of an appeal to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in that the court in this instance will be the Circuit Court which has a jurisdiction of £78,000. That will provide speedier access which is correct and laudable. All the Minister's motives are laudable but the practical operation of those objectives will run into the sand and problems will be encountered. I believe I should raise this aspect in the Chamber today as somebody who practises in those courts, knows the workload which already exists and recognises what this will mean. It could mean that next year the Minister will be back to seek an increase in the number of judges to practise in the Circuit Court because the system will be creaking at the seams, if not clogged up entirely. The problem at High Court level, particularly in the criminal courts, will be transferred down the line to the Circuit Court. While trying to achieve various objectives, one will set others back rather than advance them.</P>
    <P>There is obviously grave concern about the serious delays in the Central Criminal Court to which Deputy Shatter referred and the significant time between the date of return for trial and the actual date of trial. That is generally from the District Court to the Central Criminal Court for charges relating particularly to rape, sexual assault and murder. Deputy Shatter mentioned that this can take a number of years. If a person is in custody, that is another problem. There is the victim on one side and the accused on the other, although everybody is presumed innocent until proved guilty. The accused could be in custody for two or three years if they do not get bail. All those matters must be taken into account. We have often seen cases being called but there have been no judges available to deal with them despite the best efforts of the Judiciary to deal with them as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the monetary jurisdictional aspect of the Circuit Court as proposed and to increase it to a realistic level. My gut feeling is that if the current proposal goes <Col N="862" /> through unamended, it will lead to significant difficulties. Unless there is a significant increase in the number of Circuit Court judges to deal with that problem, there will be a huge backlog in the system and the Minister may have to come back again.</P>

      <P>The Bill as drafted proposes to delete section 14(2) and section 14(3) of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, which provides that for a barrister appointed as a commissioner in a whole time capacity or a full-time capacity of the Law Reform Commission, such services will be deemed to be practice at the Bar for the purposes of the qualification of a judicial appointment. It appears the Minister is ending that position but he should consider it carefully. Like all Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he has been the beneficiary of tremendous research reports from the Law Reform Commission. This proposal may be a disincentive for legal practitioners to take up positions with the commission if the time they serve is no longer calculable for later appointments. I ask that this be looked at in that context. We must applaud the Law Reform Commission for some of the excellent reports it has brought forward. It has helped initiate a number of legislative measures which have been brought to fruition in this House.</P>

      <P>I am glad this Bill has finally been brought before the House. I note it was presented on 30 March 2001; there has been no great hurry to consider it. My experience of these matters tells me that anything that suggests change in the legal area is always taken very slowly.</P>
      <P>I have read the Bill and in many respects it could have been drafted 30 years ago. It is extraordinarily conservative and makes only slight changes. It assumes that everything that has been there for the past couple of hundred years will remain in place, subject only to the occasional tweaking in response to the times we live in. There is no real effort to come to grips with the differences of the 21st century <i>vis-à-vis </i>the reign of Queen Anne when one of our learned legal societies adopted the motto <i>nolumus mutari</i>. It was explained to me that <i>mutari</i> was both a transitive and intransitive verb and could be translated as either &ldquo;We are unwilling to change&rdquo;, or &ldquo;We are unwilling to be changed&rdquo;. They told me I could take either translation because both were correct. This motto from the reign of Queen Anne is still very much extant in the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal is made of the fact that solicitors can now be appointed as judges of the superior <Col N="863" /> courts. I remember proposing that and including it in a Bill in 1971. I had to withdraw it because I was subjected to the wrath of the trade union that operates north of the Liffey. I remember thinking that the much commented on restrictive practices that went on at the lower end of the Liffey, at the docks, were less restrictive than those that went on further upstream. I regret to say that not much has changed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The docks have changed, but there has been very little change upstream. The same type of restrictive practices go on. We now live in the era of the spin doctor and they pay large sums of money to portray themselves on radio and television as being supportive of progress, which, I would have thought, is scarcely the case. I welcome that, 31 years later, it will now be possible to appoint solicitors as judges of the superior courts and I do not think the sky will fall in. The Government of which I was a member in the early 1970s was told that the sky would fall in if such a thing happened.</P>
      <P>Why is it that many sections of this Bill, like other Bills before it, set out in such extraordinary detail the length of time that a barrister or solicitor has to be in practice? I do not see that that is necessarily a qualification. In most countries judges are trained as judges. They are not taken from practitioners and as a result are frequently very much better. They are more consistent and often more objective. It is assumed in the Minister's speech and the Bill that the only people it could be contemplated to appoint as judges, at any level, are practitioners. That is not so. As it is the case in England, we assume that it must be that way, but it does not have to be so.</P>
      <P>In most countries judges are trained after they graduate and they are frequently more successful. We assume that the legal system we have had for several centuries is the only one and that nothing else can be contemplated. That is not so and it would be worthwhile looking at the more sensible and less expensive arrangements that pertain in other countries. I would like provision made in some future Bill for the training of young lawyers as judges. They could specialise in particular areas if necessary. We should get away from the mania about practitioners. The reason the law trade unions want practitioners appointed to the Bench is that they want people who are familiar with what might be called &ldquo;the inner practices&rdquo; of the law. They do not want people who would rock the boat on some of what happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill makes reference to costs and that they bear interest at 8%. That is four times more than it is possible to obtain in the open market and about eight times more than for smaller sums of money. I do not know why that has continued, but it has and I am glad the Minister is changing it. There is a more fundamental difficulty with costs in the law than the rate of interest which <Col N="864" /> they bear. The difficulty is their size. It is calculated, and not denied, that costs add an average of 42% to the amount of compensation given in an average case. If someone is awarded &euro;100,000, the cost to the insurance company, and therefore the policy holders, is &euro;142,000. I do not know whether that level of costs is replicated anywhere else in the world; I doubt it. It is not on this side of the Atlantic, and would not be tolerated in the European Union outside of this country and Britain, where we have a lawyer dominated legal system in which justice, the needs of litigants and the public are secondary.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this even though he will be told that these things cannot be done. We were all told that in our day. Many advised me that one could not do various things and that the kind of provisions in this Bill would never happen. Some of the matters to which I refer may not happen for 30 years, and when they do, people will ask why were they not done 30 years before since it makes common sense.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to appoint many new judges in the District, Circuit and High Courts. I find it difficult to understand the reason it is necessary to have more judges in the High Court when the jurisdiction of the other two is to be considerably increased. Much of the civil work done in the High Court will be transferred to courts below it.</P>
    <P>Neither the Bill, nor the Minister's speech, addresses the matter of vacations. Judges sit for approximately seven and a half months of the year in the High and Supreme Courts. There are four vacations which take up between four and four and half months. If some judges, even only half, sat during the vacations, it would do much to clear the arrears in some areas about which we hear.</P>
    <P>The four terms are Michaelmas, Hillary, Easter and Trinity, which had some relevance about 200 years ago, but the public now is not aware of the difference between them or the reason these lengthy vacations, during which virtually everything comes to a halt, are compulsory. It would make a great deal more sense if the courts sat on a more logical and less historical basis. I shudder to think what would happen to the practice of medicine if it had to be conducted to the same timetable as it was 200 or more years ago. I do not know if my friend, the Minister, is a reforming zealot. I think that he is not, but he should attempt, before he gives up his office, to make one final effort, perhaps in amendments to this Bill, to bring more sensible arrangements into effect.</P>
    <P>Civil work takes up a great deal of the courts' time, a high proportion of which consists of the assessment of damages in personal injury cases, in the great majority of which there is no great contest on liability. It is simply a case of the amount. Most countries now have reached the stage where the assessment of damages for personal injury is done by assessment boards and no one suggests in the countries concerned that any great injustice is done. That could be done here, <Col N="865" /> too, quickly, expeditiously and cheaply with a huge saving for the public because the enormous amount of costs, 42% of awards, would not have to be paid leading to a considerable reduction in the cost of premiums.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the proposed board as dealing with employer's liability and motor insurance cases. I hope it will also deal with public liability cases, which are essentially the same. I am disappointed that he referred to it but does not introduce it in the Bill which is a suitable one in which to include it. If it does not see the legislative light of day soon, it will, like most things, including most of what is in the Bill, not do so for a very long time. That will be because it will be resisted. Efforts will be made to have the assessment of damages by people other than judges declared unconstitutional. This measure would have been brought forward years ago but for the implicit threat that it would be found to be unconstitutional, which is a great pity as the country is choosing to inflict on itself an unnecessary cost in order that the traditional sources of income of certain professions can be preserved. That is not justifiable.</P>
    <P>There are 38 sections and three Schedules to the Bill. Many of the sections deal with trivial matters that could have been dealt with under the remit of the Minister, as Ministers have powers to make orders on many matters, some of them very important. One example is the section on whether the Attorney General should be a member of the committee on the rules of court. He will undoubtedly have this honour conferred on him and I am sure will rejoice at it, but it does not appear to be a world shattering event.</P>

      <P>Of all these minor sections, I draw the attention of the House to section 38, to which the Minister referred, as it brings what he called mundane matters, but what I would call trivial, to their limit. Unless one has experience of these affairs, as I have, one has no idea of the toing and froing that went on to have this section included. Its effect is that the payment of expenses for High Court judges on circuit shall be made now by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than by the legal services board.</P>
      <P>I consider a pound to be a pound, or that a euro is a euro, and that it does not matter much where it comes from, but, apparently, a pound paid with dignity has more importance and value than one disbursed by a board. It is incredible that a section must be inserted into a Bill to provide for such an utterly mundane matter. I fail to understand why they have to be done but I know something of some of the sensitivities involved. I could give examples from another age but I had better not, although not much has changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, in so far as it goes. The Minister is committed to having it passed with <Col N="866" /> some amendments prior to the dissolution of the Dáil and I congratulate him on that. In so far as the jurisdictions are concerned, the figures mentioned are sensible. I heard Deputy Penrose say that the Bar Council was not in favour of it. I have no doubt it is not in favour of it. I recall on one occasion in the early 1970s proposing to raise the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £600 to £1,000 and to raise the civil jurisdiction of the District Court from £50 to £100. I was told that was outrageous and unthinkable, that it could not be done and that it would have the most devastating effect. I welcome the figures the Minister has published but I notice that under an Act of 1991, he has power to make these increases anyway by order. Why did he wait to put this measure in legislation? It might have been better to do it earlier by way of order.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Bill being passed and I hope that between now and Committee Stage the Minister might consider some of the amendments I have suggested. In particular he might consider bringing in the necessary provision for the personal injuries assessment board, which is the most vital of the numerous reforms needed in our legal system and in the administration of law.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Bill, I am concerned about the increase in the number of judges. I wrote to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about this some time ago. I do not have the actual figures to hand &ndash; I tried to get them from the Department today, so far without success &ndash; but there has been a huge increase in the numbers of judges and we are now proposing to increase the numbers again. There is a danger that the currency may become debased by increasing constantly the supply of judges. That is not a reflection on anybody in particular but it is something we need to consider. The courts, in the main, have upheld the law and applied justice and, in some cases, they have done the work of this House. However, judges are unaccountable in reality and they sometimes put independence and accountability in the same stall, so to speak, but they are different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to section 7 but I would first like to tease out some questions in relation to the Judiciary, the Government and the Legislature in view of the content of the Bill. In the United Kingdom, there is the Office of Lord Chancellor, who is at once head of the Judiciary, member of the Cabinet and a member of the Legislature as chairman of the House of Lords. That could not happen here because of the separation of powers, and I do not suggest it should, but an effort has been made in recent years to evolve the role of the Attorney General into some sort of 16th <Col N="867" /> member of the Cabinet. I am fearful that the Attorney General would become the representative of the lawyers at Cabinet. That is not a reflection on any particular Attorney General, I am talking about the office itself.</P>
    <P>If we compare the role of the Attorney General, as adviser to the Government, to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as adviser to this House, the Comptroller and Auditor General has remained absolutely independent, even independent of the House and the Committee of Public Accounts which I had the honour to chair for a number of years. He does not take direction from anybody. To some extent, however, the Office of the Attorney General has not maintained the sort of independence one would expect from an independent, neutral adviser on law. The Office of the Attorney General has now become more than adviser to the Government. It is some sort of protector of the Constitution by court rules, a type of Robin Hood figure who is there by implication of the rules of the courts.</P>
    <P>It appears it is now intended that the Office of the Attorney General will become a type of super clearing house for the appointment of judges. I do not know how that came about. This is a serious point that needs to be debated, and this Bill needs to be amended. I mention this in passing but perhaps it is time to consider appointing a Minister of State at the Office of the Attorney General so that the Legislature can, in appropriate, open and defined circumstances, seek accountability from the Attorney General on his ever-increasing and widening role. The Dáil should consider a vetting procedure for judges before they are appointed and perhaps we should consider setting out guidelines for the ethical behaviour of judges so that what would or could constitute a motion to remove a judge by the Houses of the Oireachtas would be clear to all.</P>
    <P>I want to mention in passing the Sheedy case. As far as I can recollect I have never spoken on it in this House but there is an element of that case that has never been cleared up. There may be other peculiar circumstances where such issues have not come to public attention but one question which remains unasked from that case is why the original presiding judge, Judge Matthews, who indicated that a lighter sentence was being considered actually applied a heavier sentence. Did he, at that stage, become aware of something untoward that caused him to change his mind? Everybody who justified what happened thereafter said that someone had to correct an injustice that was done but as far as I can see nobody asked why Judge Matthews indicated he was considering a particular sentence and then imposed a much heavier sentence. That question needs to be asked. Is something untoward happening that we do not know about? Unless we lay down some rules and regulations and unless there are known rules for the ethical behaviour of judges, is there not a greater likelihood of the sort of controversy which arose in the Sheedy case arising again?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" />Judges have started their own review. That needs to be watched with great care. Nobody can be a judge in their own cause, so to speak. A certain person told me that when his father was Attorney General, he would render advice to the then Government. The Taoiseach would thank him for his advice and the Cabinet would make whatever decision was best in its judgment, and the courts were available to anybody who wished to challenge that decision. In a five-judge court one can get a three to two decision, for example, so no one lawyer, be it the Attorney General or otherwise, can be considered to be infallible.</P>
    <P>I want to return to section 7 because the Bill, as circulated, proposes to allow solicitors to be appointed to the higher courts for the first time. Section 7 provides for a statutory right for the Attorney General to be consulted before judges are appointed. The Attorney General is leader of the Bar which puts him in the position of insider on behalf of a stream of lawyers. Alternatively, what would the Bar Council say if the next or some future Government appointed a solicitor as Attorney General? As I understand it, there is no reason that should not be done, but there would be uproar if it was done. Yet it thinks it is right that a barrister should be put in this position, as provided for under section 7.</P>
    <P>Who sought this provision and why was it sought? Is it to protect the public interest, as the Attorney General is required by court to do or to protect the interests of barristers? A judicial appointments advisory board already exists, of which the Attorney General is a member. Why does he now need a separate and sole statutory right of consultation? The Attorney General is adviser to the Government. Why should he have any statutory right of consultation? The Government, of which the Attorney General is not a member, must be free to seek and to accept or reject whatever advice it wishes. What would legislators think if, say, the Chief Justice sought the statutory right of sole and separate consultation on the appointment of judges? They would think it a gross interference with the independence of the Executive and the Oireachtas. The Attorney General's constitutional station in life does not give him a right to such a statutory power.</P>
    <P>It is the President of Ireland who appoints judges, as set out in Article 35 of the Constitution. She exercises this power on the advice of the Government whose members are exclusively Members of the Oireachtas, almost always TDs. There is no constitutional provision that requires or suggests a statutory role for the Attorney General. Many Attorneys General have had private practices while serving as Attorney General. Counsel depend on solicitors for their briefs. Are solicitors to be beholden to an advocate who could influence their prospects for appointment to the Bench separately from the appointment to an advisory board. Should other barristers be put in a subservient position to one of their number?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" />The proposal is of doubtful constitutional validity. The Government relies on the advice of the Attorney General on the constitutionality of proposed legislation. As nobody can be judge in his or her own cause, the Attorney General should have sought the advice of a senior solicitor before advising on section 7.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a statutory right of prior consultation before the appointment of judges, it should be conferred on an Oireachtas committee to ensure there is openness and transparency in the public interest. This is one way the Oireachtas could carefully examine Government proposals and hold the Executive more accountable for its actions. It is a further indication of the need for the Oireachtas to interest itself more fully in the administration of justice and of the need for reform. I have been pursuing this matter since I published the Reform of Courts Administration Bill, 1986 some provisions of which have since been implemented. I quoted Deputy O'Malley at that time.</P>
    <P>Another delicate point is, should the President-CEO of the Progressive Democrats have a separate and sole right of consultation before persons eligible for the office of judge can be appointed? I have had the occasional clash with Mr. McDowell, but I respect his integrity. However, that is not the point. It is his judgment that requires scrutiny. If a future Attorney General were also Secretary General of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or President of either of those parties, should he or she have a statutory right to sole consultation before judges could be appointed? I think not. Neither should the current provisions be allowed to proceed.</P>
    <P>Mr. McDowell needs to be called publicly to account. I call on him to make a statement on the matter. I wrote to him about this matter when this Bill was published and other than an acknowledgement from his office I have had no further communication from him. This is an appropriate matter to raise on this debate and I hope I have raised it in an appropriate and dignified manner. It is an issue of concern that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but like previous speakers believe it would be better if it contained more fundamental change. It would be better if it went further in allaying the real concerns people have about the workings of the courts or what sometimes seem to be the non-working of them and, as Deputy Shatter said, what seem to be extraordinary and outrageous judgments, which instead of encouraging people to seek justice deter them from doing so. It is a matter of great public concern that time limits and financial constraints do not allow a great number of people seeking justice to believe they have access to it. It is of even more concern when, having gone through the long and torturous procedure of bringing a case to court, judgments are made that not alone deny people justice but in rape and serious sexual assault cases leave them <Col N="870" /> feeling that they are being raped and traumatised all over again.</P>
      <P>In a climate where everyone must be highly skilled, update their skills and raise their awareness to even hold on to or progress in their jobs, it is extraordinary that there is no demand for such training within our legal system. I concur with the call for such training by previous speakers. The introduction of training of judges is of imperative urgency and it is extraordinary it has not yet been introduced.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege of attending a conference recently of a group in Dublin Castle and it was a great learning experience. The group included judges from the UK, social workers, members of the police force and other people involved in dealing with violence against women and on the streets. One of my greatest learning experiences from that conference was gained from participating in a workshop of practising judges who exchanged information on the different jurisdictions they represented in the UK. They gave information on this area and people from outside the law advised how they felt certain reforms should come about. That gave me and other lay people attending the conference a great insight into the thinking of and ways in which judges reach their decisions. It was the most accessible and open experience I have had of the judicial system. That type of workshop would be of extraordinary benefit and should be part of the training and retaining of judges.</P>
      <P>Prior to that conference a group of enterprising judges in the UK formed a network of people who meet frequently to exchange information. They update each another and leave themselves open in an informal session where they can exchange information and lay people can learn how and why they come to some decisions. There is a great need for such a network here. There are times when judgments are made that do not concur with the sense of justice or the sense of decision making in which the lay man or particularly people before the courts can believe.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter referred to some of the most extraordinary and distressing judgments on rape and sexual assault cases that emerged during this week alone. I believed, as did many women who got in touch with me, that any learning, reform or legislation that had painfully been brought through this Legislature had been rolled back. Not only is there no reform but we are moving backward rather than forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of cases stated is another area to which my attention has been drawn by Deputy Shatter &ndash; and of which the Minister is aware &ndash; where reform is needed in regard to the efficiency and effectiveness of the working of the courts. If a judge has a retirement date by which time he will not have concluded a case, the case has to start all over again. A reform that should be introduced under the Bill is that in such cases there should be provision to appoint the judge as a temporary judge, for the purpose of finalising any case or <Col N="871" /> cases which that judge has not completed at the date of retirement. That makes eminent sense and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>
    <P>I applaud what Deputy O'Malley has said, that we should grasp this opportunity to make more fundamental reforming changes. There is grave public concern about the perception of the Judiciary and the type of inward looking world it is. It is no coincidence that within the English system the inner temple is used. In fairness to the Scottish system it has devised its own.  I see that as a symbol of a huge amount of the arcane workings of the courts.</P>
    <P>A fundamental reform of the Bill should be that the Judiciary and we as legislators are set up in such a way as to ensure, as far as possible, that justice can be administered openly, transparently, effectively and, above all, fairly. The opportunity to do this should not be missed. Despite the many submissions which the Minister will receive to delay or object to reform, he should use these weeks to bring about some of the fundamental reform for which we are crying out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I welcome particularly the opportunity to support the progressive positions being proposed in the Bill. There have been substantial changes in recent years. This is as it should be because we live in a changing world. Society has changed. The demands on the courts, as elsewhere, are changing all the time. It is important the courts which have served us exceptionally well should be equipped to deal with the evolution of society and problems that may arise in the future. The area of family law has become a huge new dimension in court practice. Matters of this kind have always to be taken into account when changes are proposed either to the courts, court practices or the number of judges available. I welcome the fact that what is proposed in the Bill is not being proposed once and for all. It has to be recognised that there will continue to be a need for change and reform.</P>
      <P>The second point I make, which the Minister has underlined, is that the courts are there to serve the citizens, not the judges, or the practising lawyers. The priority to be borne in mind is that the fundamental role of the courts is to serve the needs and vindicate the rights of the ordinary citizens. Sometimes these rights come in conflict particularly in the civil courts. That is the area where the independent Judiciary must make a determination which will be binding on all the parties who seek access to the courts. For this reason change is important, and I welcome a number of changes which have taken place recently, particularly some changes which have taken place at the behest of that most conservative of bodies, the Bar Counsel, of which I happen to be a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendations it made some years ago, it was left open to those of us who feel more comfortable without the wigs <Col N="872" /> on our heads not to wear them. A large number of the members of the Bar avail of the opportunity to appear properly robed but without the extra camouflage of a wig which seems to convey a strangeness, an authority and a solemnity which is not necessary or appropriate. In that context it must be remembered that the Judiciary particularly has to be conscious that its role always is to vindicate the citizen's right.</P>
    <P>I will make some observations on that. From now on, the reports of the judicial appointments advisory board will be presented to the Oireachtas. My colleagues here will understand that the independence of the Judiciary which has been the cornerstone of the Constitution must remain and must be respected by us if, and whenever, we come to debate these reports which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is an interconnection between all the institutions of Government, including the Judiciary, but I hope if and when we debate those reports we will not fall into the trap of setting ourselves up as alternative judges to comment on the discharge of responsibility of individual judges, in the matter of sentencing or such matters. It is right and proper that we should comment and criticise if needs be on a trend, as we see it. Equally, it would be entirely inappropriate and would undermine that independence, which is so vital in the whole operation of the Judicial and courts system, if we were to use that provision to criticise individual judges on the sentences they might impose. If so, we might as well recognise that the whole independence of the Judiciary will be undermined. I make this comment in advance in light of the new provision.</P>
    <P>The third point concerns the rights of citizens. There is probably no area where that comes into play more critically than in the area of criminal law. Because of all the demands being made of judges &ndash; I have some reservations and apprehensions about some of the extra curricular demands &ndash; it has been demonstrated that on many occasions the President of the High Court does not have available to him a sufficient number of judges to deal with a particular matter, from the point of view of the individual citizen. I have in mind especially the criminal trials and the lack of an adequate number of judges to deal with them. It is a matter of grave concern, not in the interests of the Bar, solicitors or anyone else involved in the legal profession, but in the interests of those being sent for trial.</P>
    <P>We are familiar with the old principle that justice delayed is justice denied. I understand there is a minimum delay of 18 months between a return for trial from the District Court to the Central Criminal Court, for charges which relate to serious offences such as murder and rape. In some cases the accused remains in custody until the trial date, which is, by any standards, unsatisfactory. Unfortunately, when the trial date comes around there are insufficient judges to deal with the matters coming up for hearing in the Central Criminal Court. I welcome the Minister's pro<Col N="873" /> posal in the Bill to increase the number of High and Circuit Court judges in that context.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas is constitutionally an arm of government in its broadest sense and its Members, while welcoming the Minister's decision, should be conscious of the dangers of referring every issue of importance to a sworn judicial inquiry. While I do not question our right to judge what is important, I have had reservations about such inquiries since the establishment of the beef tribunal, which lasted for a considerable length of time. If we insist on establishing many inquiries to look into important matters without considering whether there is sufficient judicial capacity to deal with them, I regret to say that we will cause some of the problems we bemoan, namely, lack of access to courts and long delays before trial. I am glad to say, however, that there has been a significant improvement on the civil side, as cases in that area are being set down much more expeditiously than was formerly the case. It is a tribute to Governments during the years which, in consultation with the president of the High Court, have increased the number of judges and helped break the terrible logjam on the civil side.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Bar, I have had no illusions of grandeur. I am always slightly amused and a little cynical when I hear people quoting whom they call &ldquo;eminent senior counsel&rdquo;, when it suits them. While I do not claim to be eminent, I have been a senior counsel since 1973 and I am happy that my views on issues such as we are discussing today should be questioned and challenged. The fact that a senior counsel gives an opinion does not mean that the opinion suddenly develops an eminent status and should not be questioned. If we have reservations about views expressed by senior counsel, I suggest that we attach the same eminence to them as we do on occasions when we happen to agree with them.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about the Office of the Attorney General. I was in government on a number of occasions when the Attorney General, in the course of his constitutional role, advised the Government in respect of appointments to the Bench, whether at Circuit, High or Supreme Court level. While I do not question the objectivity of Deputy Shatter's views as expressed in the House today, I do not share his concern about an Attorney General who practises in the superior courts. It is important that an Attorney General should be free, where appropriate, to take cases in the courts, although not on a full-time basis.</P>

      <P>It is important that legal professionals, no matter what their office, should not be remote from the practice, procedure and changing moods and needs of the courts. It is harmful to be to be isolated in an office without a connection to those one represents, as I discover each time I return to the courts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes referred to judicial reviews, which did not take place to a great extent ten or 15 years ago, due to the old issues of <i>mandamus</i> and <i>certiorari</i>. It is quite appropriate that judicial review has become a growth area. If there are inappropriate exercises of administrative responsibility, which we find from time to time in local authorities, planning boards or elsewhere, it is essential that a citizen has the right to bring judicial review proceedings, which I welcome. It has to be noted, at the same time, that it applies only in respect of decisions, either of administrative tribunals or lower courts, such as the District Court. There is no facility for judicial reviews of High Court decisions, as that court determines whether something was done, undone, or not done, which might either offend the law as we pass it or the Constitution which the people have adopted. The only provision in such circumstances is an appeal to the Supreme Court, a provision used constantly. I have found myself on both sides of it in recent times, properly so.</P>
      <P>It is important that matters can be reviewed by our courts. I hope practising lawyers, solicitors and barristers, as well as other citizens, are of the view that the judicial review procedure has been an extra avenue to vindicate or test rights. It is a huge growth area. Those of us who have returned to practice after a number of years have found that handling judicial review applications has helped us to relaunch our legal careers. At the same time, the judicial review system needs to be respected and enhanced.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the superior courts are being made more available to practising lawyers of both professions, as a provision is made for practising solicitors of not less than 12 years standing in Part 2 of the Bill. I do not think I am unique among my Bar colleagues in welcoming this development, although there is an observation I would like to make. I have never believed that barristers <i>qua</i> barristers have a superior knowledge to solicitors <i>qua</i> solicitors, as such a belief is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone with experience in either of the two professions knows that legal workers live, work, socialise and congregate together in places such as the Bar Library. They discuss cases and issues at the Bench and consult each other in relation to complex matters not previously encountered. There is access to a pool of knowledge, research <Col N="875" /> and reports which could not be reasonably or normally available to practising solicitors unless they engage with large chambers. Sometimes there is a certain status distinction between the two branches of the law. I never see it that way and I could not attempt to justify such a distinction. However, the social contact and legal facilities happen to be available to members of the Bar and that is a very important asset.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses the important point that no one, not even judges, has a guarantee of permanence in a job. Judges are subject to <i>Anno Domini</i> in the same way as everyone else, and I welcome the provision in the Bill which allows them to continue for a period to conclude the consideration and determination of cases. This issue has become a problem recently and as judges retire, there are occasions when there is pressure to conclude the case. That is not a good idea because, in the interests of litigants and no one else, judges should have the opportunity to take whatever time is necessary for consideration and study to reach a conclusion. If that cannot be done within their term of appointment, there is no reason that it cannot be extended.</P>
    <P>I will make a final observation regarding the Office of the Attorney General. One has to be careful. I recall over the years that the only advice available to the Government regarding the appointment of judges was from the Attorney General to the Minister who made the decision or a recommendation to Government. This system worked. I had reservations about the procedures introduced some years ago which I expressed in the Seanad. I took the view that one should not change something which is working. My concern at the time was that if people submit applications to this board, many of whom will be colleagues at the Bar or in the Incorporated Law Society, if they are not successful, they carry a sanction or penalty when they go back to their practices. This issue has been dealt with in this Bill to the extent that the matter cannot be disclosed to anyone in the event of someone being unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. In an ever changing society there will always be a need for reform and change. The seldom quoted motto of the Bar is <i>nolumus mutari</i>. Whether that is a transitive or intransitive verb, it means, &ldquo;We do not wish to be changed&rdquo;, or &ldquo;We will not change&rdquo;. I am glad that motto is no longer practicable. If this Bill contributes to effective reform, then I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I wish to begin with a few general remarks. I regret that my contribution to the debate is later than I intended, but I understood the debate was not to begin until 4 p.m. I regret this late contribution for a number of reasons, not least of which is that the Minister is <Col N="876" /> not present. It is important that he is in the House for this debate.</P>
      <P>I also regret that this debate is taking place at the back end of a Friday. This is important legislation, but it could be more important as its scope is limited in terms of the reforms which are required. Notwithstanding the wonderful motto quoted by Deputy O'Kennedy, change is required in the areas of judicial conduct and judicial affairs and as the State and the requirements of the people change. It is not acceptable to shove this debate into the back end of a Friday and guillotine Second Stage. Many Members would wish to comment on the Bill as many of us have interactions at some level with the judicial system and would have important contributions to make. It is not good that we are circumscribed by the timetabling of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not in the House as I wish to express my regret that the Courts Bill published in my name, which simply proposed to appoint three additional Circuit Court judges, could not have passed all Stages by agreement this afternoon. That is the will of the House. If we had done so, the Seanad could have dealt with the Bill next week and we could have appointed the three additional judges which the Flood tribunal requested last summer when it received the promise of a quick response.</P>
      <P>One can only come to the conclusion that the tardiness of the Government's response in appointing those additional members to the Flood tribunal is not accidental. A delay of a week, a month or even three months might be put down to difficulties. However, the request was made last summer and there is still no sense of urgency or alacrity in doing the important work of the Flood tribunal. The simple, two line Bill to appoint the additional Circuit Court judges would have met that requirement. I deeply regret that for no good reason other than the Bill did not come from the Government side of the House, it could not be accepted today.</P>
      <P>This situation is grossly unfair to the three eminent &ndash; I use that word although I am cautioned against it &ndash; legal personages who were offered the posts and announced on 19 February. Two of those offered the positions were senior counsels. The three were announced publicly and cleared their desks on 19 February so, as judges, they would not be involved in normal work. I understand that they are very frustrated and they deserve better treatment. I am annoyed that the Minister did not see fit to resolve this issue by accepting my proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on what is, and what should be, in the Bill. Much of the contents of the Bill will not be opposed by the Labour Party. The eligibility of practising solicitors of not less than 12 years standing to be appointed to the superior courts is long overdue. The artificial divide between the two branches of the legal profession has been a mystery to many of us who are not lawyers. Some of the artificial barriers which have been created do not serve the public well so it is <Col N="877" /> important to break them down. Many of these barriers have been broken down legislatively, but are reinstated by custom, practice and prejudice. It is not only important that we legislate, but that we insist that the laws we enact are upheld and put in place.</P>
    <P>The proposal that Circuit Court judges be eligible to be appointed to the superior courts after two, rather than four, years' service is also important, although it is not of great moment. I wish to be conscious of the quantifiably different roles of Circuit and High Court judges. I do not know whether this should be seen as an automatic promotion. Some people are suited to being fair and good judges in the Circuit Court, but would not function well in the High Court. We should not create the notion that it is like joining the Garda, with eventual promotion to superintendent. There are people who are absolutely suitable for District Court level but not other levels, those who are suitable for the Circuit Court but not the High Court and those who could sit at any level. The implication that this is a promotional grade would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill places the obligation on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to ensure nominees have appropriate knowledge of decisions, practice and procedures of the courts to which they are recommended. It is important they would have such knowledge but how would it be tested? Some time ago there was dispute in Government over the appointment of judges that spilled into the public domain. The Government asked the Chief Whip, now the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and me to address the issue. We came up with a proposal for a judicial appointment procedure which was enacted by the next Government so I have some knowledge of the practices in relation to the appointment of judges. There was an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement. It was amazing to hear the views of those in the legal profession on their sense of dignity about applying for a job. The vulgarity of applying to be a judge was anathema; they might be rejected and would be so devastated, their ego so crushed, that they would not be able to show their face among colleagues again. I do not accept that. There must be clear criteria by which people qualify for appointment to very important positions.</P>
    <P>How will knowledge of decisions, practice and procedures of the courts be assessed? If the application is such a burden, it is doubtful there will be a test. How will people's suitability on grounds of character and temperament, as provided for in section 7(<i>b</i>)(i)(III), be tested? That is an exciting prospect for the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board &ndash; judging the character and temperament of individuals in relation to their suitability to be appointed as judges. It is, however, extremely important, a fundamental requirement for legislation dealing with judicial conduct.</P>
    <P>Earlier discussions about this led to flawed proposals for a constitutional amendment and I take some credit for exposing the inadequacies of the <Col N="878" /> Government proposals to the extent they were withdrawn. The reason the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said he could not proceed with the constitutional amendment was that it lacked cross-party support in the House and a constitutional amendment could not, therefore, be advocated. Obviously that does not apply to every issue. There is an unanswerable case for such an amendment to ensure criteria for judicial accountability.</P>
    <P>I regret that since that initial testing of the water, we have seen no more of the idea. That is a great pity and it must be taken up by the Minister's successor because we need judicial accountability the same as we need the air of transparency that blows through this House, the administration of the Civil Service, local government and, hopefully, the Garda. The notion that any individual, even an exalted judge, is master of his own court to the extent that no one can comment on his decisions, even those that are bizarre, does not sit well in a democracy. We walk a fine line between the absolute independence of the Judiciary, which must be a cornerstone of any democratic society, and accountability. That line must be defined. Judges are not even accountable to their peers, much less the Oireachtas. It will be difficult to get those balances right. My party put forward good suggestions and the Government's proposals were worthwhile but we must revisit them.</P>
    <P>We must go beyond accountability and consistency to basic good manners. Some of the comments judges make about people are appalling. A judge in the west described an unfortunate man before him as having a face like a mallet. That is unacceptable in a courtroom. Good manners should be listed among the requirements to be appointed a judge. Training and proper selection will lead to this but the proposals before us today do not get anywhere near to achieving it. We will not have time to deal with the issue in the current Dáil, it will fall to be dealt with by the next Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and should be given priority. If we enact this legislation in the meantime, I will be interested to find out how the suitability on the grounds of character and temperament will be tested in these proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides for an annual report by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, a welcome development. The criteria and style of the report will have to be decided after the enactment of the legislation but it will give the Oireachtas a better insight into the procedures for appointing judges and the associated difficulties. Not everyone wants to be a judge now, as the Government discovered when seeking volunteers to sit on the tribunals. We will have real knowledge, not just anecdotal evidence, through the annual report.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension in jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts. There is an argument about the exact nature of the increase being a <Col N="879" /> value judgment but I will not take issue with the Minister's assessment.</P>
    <P>The appointment of additional judges is one of the primary issues in the Bill. It proposes one additional High Court judge but the Minister says he will table an amendment to enable two additional appointments. The additional Circuit Court judges are not provided for at all in the Bill and will also be provided for by means of an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he wishes to introduce a number of technical amendments. I give him notice that I will not agree to have the Bill guillotined on Committee Stage. We must have time to debate these matters and sight of the Minister's amendments well in advance. There was talk of Committee Stage being scheduled for next Tuesday, but that would be unreasonable in the context of Opposition Deputies having to prepare amendments, consider Government amendments and, if necessary, seek outside advice.</P>
    <P>The delays in the courts are a real issue, as are the costs of litigation. Even where people take action, where the awards are tiny, they incur a penalty in the form of legal costs. It cannot be right and just that the penalty should be incurred in the legal costs in taking a case rather than by any fine imposed or settlement arrived at by the courts. We must come to terms with this and be allowed to discuss it.</P>
    <P>While additional judges are to be appointed, an array of additional staff measures are required. The Courts Service has made good progress on court buildings, but many of them are still dreadful. They are inaccessible to those who are immobile or visually impaired. A programme of work setting out exactly what needs to be done in this area is required.</P>
    <P>It is essential to address the issue of judicial training. When teachers become principals they embark on an entirely different job. The same applies to barristers and solicitors appointed judges. While there is on-the-job training and training in terms of conferences and seminars, a much more proactive and structured form of training is required. That applies especially to the family courts. Other Deputies mentioned a number of abuse cases where specific training is required. Perhaps dedicated judges expert in handling such cases should be appointed to deal exclusively with them on a rotation basis. The differences in views expressed by different judges who happen to deal with these cases intermittently are causing a lack of confidence in the administration of justice and, therefore, a decline in the reporting of serious crime. Both issues must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I hope I will have more time to elaborate on my views on Committee Stage. I regret the Minister was not present to hear what I had to say and also that I was not present for the start of the debate because of the rescheduling of the commencement time.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>When as conservative a person as Deputy O'Malley describes this Bill as conservative legislation, one can deduce it is very conservative. A number of Courts and Court Officers Bills have been introduced to the House during the years, an examination of which will show that the Government of the day tinkered around the edges of the legal and judicial system in a very piecemeal way. This Bill is similar. There is no root and branch analysis of the legal system, the role of the courts, court officers, judges and so on from any kind of a radical or fundamental perspective, such as their role in society and the changes necessary. The legal system is an arm of the conservative Establishment whose thinking dominates this society, economically, socially and politically. The Government of the day takes that as read and any legislation it introduces tinkers around the edges of these issues while making no attempt at a fundamental review of whether, for example, judges are qualified to do the job they are appointed to do.</P>
      <P>There is also a huge class bias within the legal and judicial system. The leading court officers are drawn from a privileged strata of society and their thinking is totally suffused with its mores. The majority of people &ndash; the poor, the working classes and the unemployed &ndash; have no opportunity to become part of the legal establishment. Their main dealings with the law arise when they appear on the opposite side of the bench to the judge. On numerous occasions there is a chasm of misunderstanding between them because the judge's experience of life, education and privilege in society is far removed from that of ordinary working class people, many of whom are before the courts for very different reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An entire section of the courts system at District Court and Circuit Court levels deals with nothing other than the downside of society. I am reminded of my time as an inner city teacher many years ago. Children of 12 and 13 years of age with reading ages of six and seven years attended my classes. As long as the teacher was willing to guard them, keep them quiet and off the streets, nobody wanted to know. A significant section of the resources of the courts system is also concerned with dealing with the downtrodden, the brutalised and those addicted to heroin who are constantly in and out of the District and Circuit Courts, taking up huge resources. There is no thinking on attempts to break this vicious cycle. Instead, there are occasional innovations, such as the designation of the District Court to <Col N="881" /> deal primarily with those addicted to heroin and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not taken the opportunity to direct attention at the privilege and power of the legal profession within our society. It is quite incredible that for nearly two decades there have been stringent controls on how the wages of working people can rise in the public sector. A Minister in this Government is prepared to batter teachers into the ground rather than give them pension rights regarding supervision duties and their wages generally. Yet when it comes to the legal profession the Government is absolutely terrified and will not hear of placing any kind of restrictions on the fees demanded by the legal profession. This means of course that justice for the ordinary person comes at a price and is denied in many cases because the ordinary person cannot afford the legal counsel they should have for cases they might want to bring.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago we questioned the Taoiseach regarding fees being set for barristers in tribunals and he justified the situation where the legal profession sets its own fees. People are earning thousands of pounds a day to act as barristers or advisers in tribunals. This is never subjected to any kind of scrutiny in the Dáil because too many Deputies are on the same wavelength as the same privileged sector of society from which the legal profession is generally drawn. This has serious consequences for the ordinary person in society because justice beyond their economic reach is justice denied. On the other hand, if you are a wealthy person or company you can purchase justice because of the quality of legal counsel one can buy. The Minister is missing an opportunity here to direct attention at these issues.</P>
    <P>A matter which has taken up a lot of time in the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, on which I serve, is motor insurance and young people. Incredibly, it has been verified that £40 out of every £100 paid out in claims for accidents in the motor insurance business goes to the legal profession; this in contrast to other countries where it is £6 or £7 or less. This situation requires a radical shake-up and involves taking on a privileged bastion of society, something the Government is failing to do and seems terrified of trying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the qualifications of judges, whether those are judges of the District Court, Circuit Court or any other court. It is incredible that a judge can stand up in court, as happened a week ago, say the only aggravating circumstance in a case of rape was a threat to kill the victim and let the perpetrator go with a suspended sentence. A judge who makes such a remark, betraying such judgment, should be dismissed forthwith. It is absolutely incredible. How can we have judges sitting in court who are so removed from the lives and feelings of ordinary people that they can act in this way? It points to a grievous deficiency in the requirements for appointment of judges in the first place. Why do we not have attention directed to that so that <Col N="882" /> such outrages will never occur and no victim of such trauma will be subjected to such crass ignorance and lack of understanding of his or her trauma? As to the seriousness of a crime such as rape itself, let alone being dismissive of a mere threat to kill the victim &ndash; I do not know if those are the reasons Deputy O'Malley described this as a conservative Bill but they would be the reasons I would give. We need a root and branch examination of this area. We need a judicial system which is representative of the views and lives of the majority of ordinary people in our society and which is not so removed from them as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he intended on Committee Stage to provide for three judges to go to the Flood tribunal. It is a source of absolute scandal that a request nine months ago from Mr. Justice Flood for three judges for his tribunal is only now being dealt with by the Government through the vehicle of this Bill. That is an outrage. The question must be asked &ndash; why the delay? We have here an abuse by the Government for political advantage to itself of the tribunals set up early in the life of this Dáil. It suited the Government not to have the extra judges as less embarrassing material would be brought out in public before the upcoming general election. That is the reason for the dragging of feet and should not have been allowed.</P>
    <P>There is a crucial necessity to speed up investigations in the tribunals. They are obviously turning up very important information and have lifted the veil on many dark sides of the relationship between big business and leading politicians and sections of the political system. It is vital that continues but people want to see these investigations brought to an end and conclusions drawn. They are costing enormous amounts of money, with barristers virtually able to write their own fees. Virtually every week new matters come to the fore which need to be referred to the Flood tribunal. For example, <i>Magill </i>came out yesterday with urgent new revelations which must be investigated by the Flood tribunal, requiring the urgent allocation of more resources to the tribunal. The revelations concern the modifications in 1987 of the terms of gas and oil licences to multinational companies made by then Minister Ray Burke, which gave away our natural resources for nothing &ndash; not a penny in royalties. The tax regime also allowed them to write off virtually any costs. Those issues must be investigated by the Flood tribunal, hence the scandal in the delay in appointing these extra members.</P>
    <P>Sa Bhille seo, Bille na gCúirteanna agus na nOifigeach Cúirte, 2001, níl aon iarracht scrúdú níos leithne ná níos doimhne a dhéanamh ar an gcóras dlí agus ar chóras chuirte na tíre seo.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate. The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001, is essentially a practical piece of legislation which combines some significant provisions with others which, while somewhat mundane in nature, are worthy of implementation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter noted the need to have access to a wider pool of individuals in so far as appointment to judicial office is concerned. He acknowledged past measures directed towards achieving this aim. Regarding the reference in my speech to rights of audience, I assure Deputy Shatter that this is not intended in any way to cut down the plain words of the section which are contained in the Bill. Eligibility will include those acting either as an advocate or as a solicitor instructing counsel or both. It would be healthy for the development of the profession of solicitors if more solicitors were to follow Deputy Shatter's example and exercise their right of audience. This, as he correctly pointed out, has been available to solicitors for more than 30 years, courtesy of Deputy O'Malley's Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies Shatter and Mitchell mentioned the need for greater transparency in the appointment of judges. I have some difficulty with the idea of an Oireachtas committee to deal with this issue. It might be difficult to devise a mode of operation which would not encroach upon the independence of the judiciary. The judicial appointments advisory board has already made an impact by providing a structure which puts an element of distance between the selection of judges and the political process. In this Bill further transparency measures are being provided for. This is definitely an area in which we need to make haste slowly, as the Romans might have put it. The administration of justice is such a central element in our society that the introduction of any fundamental change warrants considered and cautious scrutiny.</P>
      <P>I note what has been said about the need to provide more resources for the lower courts, especially by Deputy Penrose. I will introduce an amendment to the Bill during the course of its passage which will expand the range of quasi-judicial powers available to county registrars and this will considerably relieve the burden on Circuit Court judges. Deputy Penrose made the point that because of the change of jurisdiction of the Circuit Court we will need to appoint an additional 20 judges. I hope Deputy Penrose was not suggesting that we demote 20 High Court judges. Deputy Shatter dealt with the question of extra Circuit Court judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will consider the position of the Circuit Court when the additional jurisdiction is conferred upon <Col N="884" /> it. It is too early now to estimate the exact impact but I accept that there will be an impact. It is likely to take some time for the effects of the initial extension of the jurisdiction to be felt in the Circuit Court. On a serious note, I acknowledge Deputy Penrose's point that there will be a need for additional resources. We will need to consider that seriously. Perhaps the transfer of resources, as opposed to personnel, would be appropriate. In any event, the change of jurisdiction will result in additional resources. It is not possible, however, for me to quantify that now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter adverted to delays in the Central Criminal Court. The backlog is decreasing. Judges will shortly return to the High Court. The benchmarking body chaired by Mr. Justice Quirke will report by the end of June. With regard to the resources available to the High Court, the appointment of two High Court judges must be considered in tandem with the proposal to expand the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, thereby relieving pressure on the High Court. Deputy O'Kennedy also referred to delays in the Central Criminal Court. I intend to increase the number of judges by two and hope to see judges returning from other work later in the year. Under this Bill, the High Court will deal with less civil work due to the transfer of civil work to the Circuit Court. That, at least, is what is expected. The Courts Service Board has recently established a committee to look into the distribution of business across the various courts. This will include a look at the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Chief Justice asking him to consider the jurisdiction of the courts. I would see great merit in a court which combined the jurisdictions of the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Court. A court such as this would lead to a greater degree of expedience in serious criminal cases. The Chief Justice took this very seriously and has referred it for examination. We are waiting to hear from him and are awaiting a report on the matter. Deputy Penrose criticised the lack of consultation rooms in courthouses. We have considerably improved the courthouse stock in recent years. This year we are providing more than &euro;26 million for courthouse accommodation. We are also investigating the possibility of using PPPs to advance the building plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley wanted to know why there was a need to specify long periods of practice requirements for judges. I acknowledge that he has a point with regard to the traditional approach which underlines the provisions concerning judicial appointments. However, there can sometimes be merit in adhering to traditions when they prove themselves to have worked in practice. These traditions have been working in practice for several hundred years, as he pointed out. The practice approach to judicial appointments is a feature of our common law. The training approach is, rather, a feature of a civil law system and would require considerably more in terms of analysis and assessment before such a sea-change could be effected. That is not to say I <Col N="885" /> agree with the motto stating that not only will they not be changed but they are unwilling to be changed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned also that some matters in the Bill could have been dealt with through regulation. I understand his point of view and this is something we could consider for future legislation. The problem with a Bill such as this is that it is like an acorn; it continues to grow. I note Deputy Barnes's point about the need for a more fundamental look at the way in which our courts operate. The Chief Justice has announced the establishment of a working group to examine the jurisdiction of the courts. Mr. Justice Finlay is the chair of that group and there are representatives of various people who have an interest in the operation of the courts. The first module with deal extensively with criminal law and the second with civil law. The third module, as I stated in my speech will consider such general changes to the court's structure as may be necessary in the light of the conclusions of the first and second modules and any other considerations which the working group considers relevant. It is an ambitious undertaking and will mean a fundamental look at the way in which our courts are organised. The aim is to ensure that access for our citizens is improved and that the mechanisms through which justice is delivered are not only efficient and fair but are seen to be so.</P>
    <P>I note what Deputy Howlin said in relation to his Private Members' Bill. It has already been indicated that provision for an additional three circuit judges will be made by way of Committee Stage amendment. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate and efficient way to proceed. I urge Deputies on all sides of the House to co-operate in ensuring that this Bill passes speedily through the House. Deputy Howlin also referred to the need for judicial accountability legislation. The Deputy will be aware that I had proposals in this area, consisting of a constitutional amendment followed by legislation to establish a judicial council and ethics committee, but that I felt compelled to withdraw the proposals because of the failure of the main Opposition parties to support them. However, I remain convinced of the need for action in this area and in particular the need for a judicial ethics and oversight body. In that respect, preliminary work on the proposals has continued in my Department.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Deputies to various aspects of the operation of the Courts Service. The Government's commitment to ensuring the success of the service is reflected in the allocation to the courts of a Vote of &euro;84.9 million in 2002. We have also substantially increased the resources of the Courts Service since its establishment, allowing for the development of a new management structure responsible for planning and implementing the necessary organisational changes to ensure that the Courts Service fulfils its mandate. I am also pleased that we have considerably increased the allocation for courthouses during the lifetime of the Government from &euro;11.3 <Col N="886" /> million in 1997 to more than &euro;31 million in 2002. The evidence of this can be seen all over the country in new and refurbished courthouses.</P>
    <P>It is important that developments continue to move apace. In this context I have recently been presented with a report which considers the merits of establishing a commercial court in Ireland which would be accessible electronically and which could develop links with arbitration centres.</P>
    <P>The report and recommendations prepared by the committee on court practice and procedures, chaired by the Honourable Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, proposes that e-courts should be developed throughout the court system and that the development of an e-commercial court would underpin and reinforce Ireland's position as an e-commerce hub, and recommends that a commercial court be developed in the High Court in Dublin. The Government attaches great importance to the provision of e-services as quickly as possible. The effectiveness of the courts is of considerable importance in underpinning the economic success of the country and supporting the continued ability of the Government to attract and retain foreign investment.</P>
    <P>Electronic services offer the potential to maximise operational efficiencies, reduce paper logjams, assist in reducing court waiting times and generally provide a much improved level of service for all court users. Internationally, the trend is towards the provision of electronic services in court environments. E-courts offer real potential to place Ireland as a hub for the settlement of commercial and e-commerce disputes, and significantly improve the perception of Ireland as a location for commercial investment. I have asked the Courts Service board to look at the implications of the report.</P>
    <P>I recognise fully the potential that IT has to make a major contribution to the future development of the Courts Service. New information and communications technologies will facilitate the provision of a world class model of service delivery. In recognition of this, my Department is providing &euro;9.4 million for IT developments. It can be seen that the benefits of the IT programme within the courts are becoming more exciting. Further progress is being achieved on a day by day basis.</P>
    <P>The importance of judicial training and preparation of our judges to deal with the new challenges which confront them cannot be overestimated. Some Deputies referred to the question of judicial training. I have explained that it is not a feature of common law, but more a feature of other jurisdictions which operate on the basis of codes. Judicial training in this jurisdiction is a matter for the Judiciary which under the Constitution is independent in the exercise of its functions. The Courts Service is responsible for the funding of this training and has made significant funds available to the Judicial Studies Institute for that purpose. Funding has been substantially increased in recent years. The Judicial Studies <Col N="887" /> Institute has put in place a comprehensive programme of training for judges, which I am sure everybody will welcome.</P>
    <P>It will be clear, through the major investment programme in both information systems and buildings, that we have demonstrated a commitment to ensure the Courts Service has the necessary infrastructure to discharge its responsibilities and at the same time support the judicial system. Enactment of the Bill will also support this commitment and ensure a modern and progressive courts system, Judiciary and Courts Service which will serve the needs of all who use our courts.</P>
