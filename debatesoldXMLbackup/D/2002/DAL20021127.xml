      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government, in its section dealing with justice, reads: &ldquo;We stand for a society where all people can feel safe in their communities, businesses and homes.&rdquo;  The publication of statistics relevant to crime in this country is a shocking indictment of the society we have become and the inability of Government to cope with the situation. Headline crime, which includes homicide, assault, sexual offences, arson, drugs, larcenies, burglaries, robbery and fraud, has increased by 18%, with a range of other increases in murder, armed robbery, burglaries and larcenies.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning on a national radio programme, who seemed to be more like a parent in despair than a Minister for Justice. He admitted in respect of an unprovoked assault on a member of his family that he did not report this crime to the Garda because it would be a waste of Garda time, despite the fact that there was no description available. Does this mean that the 2,000 extra gardaí promised by the Government in its programme will not now be employed to deal with crime? Does it mean that the figures published are just the tip of the iceberg when the Minister himself says on national radio that a crime in respect of a member of his family was not reported to the Garda because it would be a waste of Garda time?</P>
      <P>I would like the Taoiseach to respond to the central statement of the programme for Government that people should be safe in their houses, businesses and communities. I remind him that the Fianna Fáil programme for this year reads: &ldquo;We will break up the gangs involved in serious crime, especially robberies and drug trafficking, and reduce random and gratuitous violence caused by excessive alcohol.&rdquo;  I would like to see how that squares up from the Government's perspective in view of the statistics published this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform yesterday published <Col N="346" />the Garda Síochána's annual report for last year, the contents of which confirm the preliminary statistics published by the Minister in July. The headline crime figure has increased which, as the Minister already said, is both worrying and disappointing. The position in regard to headline offences is of particular concern because it indicates that the number of headline offences recorded last year increased over the previous year, which is disappointing. The additional numbers of gardaí recruited in recent years are now fully in place. Some 11,800 is the current figure. A range of legislative measures have been introduced, including a number of specialist units to deal with various levels of criminality and public disorder. There is public order legislation and a review of the licensing Acts. We must continue to deal with these issues. I do not think it is a question of legislation, even though there is more legislation planned, because most of the legislation is already in place.</P>
      <P>There are issues concerning drugs offences. The increases reflect the successful results of operations carried out by the Garda. People will be aware of the success rate against criminality and drugs gangs, which must continue in other areas. The figures relating to crime of a sexual nature are certainly worrying. I know the Minister is doing all he can in this regard. The courts have handed down very tough sentences and are dedicated to doing so.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to continue to take the necessary measures to deal with criminal behaviour. The introduction of the PULSE system means we are getting the proper facts in regard to recording crime rates. In the past there was the argument that crime was not reported, but we are now getting a much more accurate assessment of the level of crime. As worrying as that may be, it is better to be aware of the facts. The Garda crime detection record continues to be excellent. It has an impressive detection rate by international standards, which includes 87% of homicide cases, 75% of assault cases and 72% of cases of sexual offences. We must continue this success in all areas.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to paint a picture other than one of concern. We must deal with the issues as they are, put in the effort and continue to use the enormous resources already in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the word of the Government cannot be believed. Murders are up by 33%, sexual offences by 81%, assaults by 83%, drug offences by 33%, armed robberies by 14%, burglaries by 9% and larceny is up to 11,454 cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for violent assaults in Dublin are now five times higher than three years <Col N="347" />ago and detection rates are falling. Is it true that the Book of Estimates shows a zero increase in the Garda budget for next year, which equates with zero tolerance a few years ago? How does the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, intend to deal with this situation when there is no increase in the Garda budget and there will not be 2,000 extra gardaí as promised, when detection rates are falling and violent crime is five times higher than three years ago? The Government cannot be believed on crime. How does the Taoiseach intend in the programme for Government to deal with this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government says it will complete the programme of modernising prisons and providing extra places. How does that tally with the closure of Shanganagh? The Government cannot be believed on the central issue of the protection of people in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know that when extra gardaí are taken on, as almost 2,000 have been taken on in recent years, they have to be paid for. They are in the base figure and the enormous increases given to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have allowed those gardaí to pass fully through Templemore. We have a higher number of gardaí than ever at 11,800.</P>
      <P>An enormous amount of money has been put into the prison capital programme over the past five years and the programme has been completed, including the work at Cloverhill Prison, Mountjoy Prison and women's prison and Portlaoise Prison. That has continued. Shanganagh was opened in 1969 as an open detention centre for males between 16 and 21 years of age. I recognise the good work of the staff there over the years. However, it has become increasingly difficult to identify young male offenders suitable for this type of open prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual cost of keeping an offender at Shanganagh last year was &euro;127,000, <Col N="348" />which is higher than the annual cost anywhere else. Bearing in mind the full implementation of the Children Act, 2001, 16 and 17 year old inmates must be completely segregated in the prison system. The proceeds of the sale of that unit will go back into the prison system for other renewals.</P>
      <P>The complete figures show that there are problems in some areas. We will work on the legislative base and try to improve on this issue in coming years. That is what was stated in the programme for Government and it will be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the crime report for 2001. Has the Taoiseach forgotten the background of zero tolerance that brought him to office in 1997? This is the legacy of the Minister for zero tolerance. Has the Taoiseach forgotten the statement by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, when he came to office, to the effect that he would be judged at the end of his term by &ldquo;whether people felt safer on the streets and in their homes&rdquo;. Deputy Kenny has rhymed off the figures that have finally been released: an 83% increase in sexual assaults; an 81% increase in assaults; an 18% increase in headline crime; a 33% increase in murders; and a 14% increase in armed robbery. Is this the legacy of the Minister for zero tolerance? Are these the figures that he suppressed earlier this year when he admitted to my colleague, Deputy Howlin, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that he had the preliminary figures? He then sought to suppress them coming up to the general election.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and spends a lot of his time re-branding the Progressive Democrats, is acting as an estate agent for Shanganagh? He thinks it is a risible matter that we have this level of crime on our streets, that old people do not feel safe in their homes and people are besieged in their homes in some disadvantaged communities. The former Minister thinks he can share in the risibility with the new Minister. The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is a disgrace. He completely neglected his portfolio.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not failed. Crime is up but there have been numerous dedicated systems brought in by the Garda in disadvantaged communities to deal with criminality in one form or other. This is making a major impact in many areas. Much crime in the figures is related to closing time for discos and licensed premises. That is what the figures show.</P>

      <P>The number of assaults which cause harm has increased markedly and that is worrying. That has climbed over the past few years as have the figures for sexual offences, another major issue. The detection rate has improved massively and is well ahead of other jurisdictions. There are issues to deal with and they are set out in the programme for Government and the legislative programme. I have no doubt that the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have an impact also.</P>

Meanwhile, a new prison for youths is being built at Mountjoy when any expert in the area could tell us that there is a necessity for rehabilitation. The Minister did not get one penny. He came to the House last night and had great fun at the expense of the McBrearty's and others. The Minister <Col N="350" />engaged in L &amp; H debating tactics.

      <P>The Minister has clearly set out the systems and the supports he wants to give in the reform of the Garda. I have every confidence <Col N="351" />that his plans will be successful. At different times this House is very fast to criticise the Garda in its dealing with crime while permanently finding time to criticise the force for the way it deals with it. The Garda should be allowed to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent days, acres of newsprint have been filled with details of the alleged rip-off of &euro;5,000 from a semi-State company. I agree with the Taoiseach when he says there should be answers. Channel 4 television news last night highlighted an incomparably more serious rip-off of the taxpayer. There is probably &euro;1 billion worth of gas in the Corrib gasfield. In the 1980s, the Taoiseach's former colleague, Mr. Burke, varied the licence for the oil companies moving into that field removing the automatic stake of the State and giving it to them without a penny in royalties. In 1992 the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, reduced the tax take from these companies to a derisory 25%. The Minister, Deputy Fahey, and his Department intervened in the planning process in Mayo and bullied the planners and some of the local people in attempting to ram through the plans of Enterprise Oil.</P>
      <P>We know that Marathon Oil and Pearse Construction are involved in the project and donated large amounts of money to Fianna Fáil. We know that Enterprise Oil was a regular guest of the Taoiseach in his tent at the Galway Races. Will the Taoiseach give us the truth on this matter? What kind of huckster's deal was made between Fianna Fáil and the oil companies that handed over a fabulous natural resource without a single cent in royalties being paid to the people? What was the content of the negotiations? How much did the parties to the negotiations get in donations from these companies? Can we have as quick an investigation into this as the one we are promised in the cigars and whiskey affair? We must let the people know why their fabulous wealth has been given to these private companies while they must pay top euro to buy gas from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Corrib field is being developed under the 1992 licensing terms, passed by this House. The field was not discovered until 1996 and there is no linkage. Irish licences are similar to those operating in other European countries such as the UK, Denmark and Holland. While the tax rate is lower than in those countries, it reflects the significantly lower success rate of island gas exploration. Unfortunately this continues to be almost zero. It is great to rattle the sabre and speak of deals and cosy cartels, but unfortunately this country has been singularly unsuccessful in most of the area of exploration. The rights and wrongs in Mayo will be sorted out in the planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One allegation was made against the Minister, Deputy Fahey, and he has brought it to my atten<Col N="352" />tion &ndash; I believe it was shown on television last night but I did not see the programme. The Minister has told me that he had no direct dealings, good, bad or indifferent, with the company or a planning committee. Of course, officials from the Department were involved in the issue, as was Deputy Fahey, as Minister responsible. He has spoken in this House on the issue. No pressure was applied regarding planning permission for the terminal and it has gone through the process. I met the residents in this area and know they played an active part in the process.</P>
    <P>The details of donations to my party, or any party, are included in the returns sent to the Public Offices Commission.</P>

      <P>There is a small by-road in Mayo that has been labelled the &ldquo;Bertie bypass&rdquo; because the Taoiseach's entourage was diverted on to it to avoid local protesters. Fortunately, they did not catch up with the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Nach bhfuil a fhios ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil muintir Iorrais agus muintir na tíre scanallaithe faoi an dóigh a thug Fianna Fáil an tseirbhís nadúrtha i bpáirc gháis na Coiribe do chomhlachtaí móra gan pingin amháin, agus cén fáth?</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources told me in the last session that there was no attempt to independently assess the value of the Corrib gasfield. In my youth I went to the Dingle fair every month with my father to sell cows. The poorest and most uneducated farmer knew exactly the value of his cattle &ndash; if he did not he would not survive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Gulfstream IV Government jet is part of the ministerial air transport service which is provided by the Air Corps to facilitate members of the Government in fulfilling their official engagements both at home and abroad. Use of the service requires my approval. Procedurally, requests for use of the service are made by Ministers' private secretaries to my office and are dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of my office. Requests are examined by my staff with regard to the need and purpose of travel, the destination and other logistical details. Any necessary clarification or further information is sought at this point. All screened requests are then submitted to me for approval. Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or the Air Corps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>What age is the Government jet and how many flying hours has it done? What is its state of worthiness as an official jet for Government purposes? Is it true that arrangements have been made for the order and purchase of a further Government jet? Has anyone, other than Ministers and members of the Government, travelled on the jet and, if so, under what circumstances did that happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about Ministers and civil servants. Who else has travelled on it? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have all the technical details. The jet was acquired in 1991 on a ten year agreement and was finally purchased last year. I do not know the number of flying hours it has done. It has probably reached a maximum number of flying hours given its purpose. The Gulfstream jet is used for ministerial service. It is the only aircraft used now. The Beechcraft is used infrequently &ndash; it was used only 12 times this year. The CASA aircraft is used in emergencies &ndash; it was used seven times this year. We have stopped giving approval for the use of helicopters in recent years. I stopped the use of helicopters after some events a few years ago. It is still used once a month on average by the President or by Ministers. It is well known that I do not use it for reasons which are also well known. It is used by Ministers, their spouses or partners, Ministers of State, authorised officials of the public service or other persons authorised to travel by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes used by journalists who travel mainly on long trips. Journalists do not use it on short trips within Europe or on trips to normal <Col N="355" />meetings. The only times I have seen journalists use it are when they are travelling within countries in an attempt to cover visits. Journalists travelled on it when I visited Brazil and Argentina. However, they do not use it for normal trips. They went recently with the President to Africa. They are the only people who use the aircraft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach know if any of the missing brandy and cigars finished up on the Government jet? Perhaps he will let the nation know about that. Is every trip which is intended to be made on the Government jet vetted in advance for cost? Is that part of the procedure? Has it been ascertained if it might be more cost-effective and cheap for the taxpayer for Ministers or the Taoiseach to take scheduled airline flights? Does the Taoiseach agree that should become part of the procedure, if it is not part of it already? Does he agree it is not possible to justify the tens of millions of euro spent on the Government jet in capital and running costs when the Government cannot afford a few million euro for the first-time buyer's grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Every trip is vetted if that is necessary. Guidelines are set down for destinations, justifying the route, the times, the passenger details and the purpose of travel. The officials in my office who deal with this issue follow procedure. They have always done that under successive Governments. If there is an alternative, such as a scheduled flight, they would refuse use of the jet. That has always been the system, which has worked well.</P>
      <P>Our facilities are probably the worst in Europe, although I do not say that as a justification for it. However, our aircraft is in the ha'penny place compared to the others in terms of its capacity to cater for 14 people. I see that on every trip I make, although it does not worry me. The purpose of the mission is to get from one place to another.</P>
      <P>Most Ministers and officials who attend European meetings travel early in the morning to places such as Luxembourg. It often takes two days to get back here. Most Ministers take early morning flights to Brussels where they do their day's work and then come back here. That has been the practice. I assure the Deputy that the ministerial air transport service or MATS, as it is called, is not abused. It is a tight operation. It is used to deal with a large number of international meetings, whether they are related to the UN, the OECD, the European Union or other international groups and organisations. People might think it is luxurious, but the opposite is the case. It is part of the hard grind which Ministers of all parties have had to endure in recent years. I praise the staff, but the comfort we have compared to what others have is minimal for a country of our size and status. It is not abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise to Deputy Kenny for not answering one of his questions. He asked me about a second <Col N="356" />aircraft. Tenders were taken early last year when it became clear that the Beechcraft, which is approximately 25 years old, and CASA could not be used. There is no back-up. There was a prolonged period when the jet had technical difficulties and was out of action. We got costings which are still held in the Department, but a decision was not made. We will have to do that before the Irish Presidency in 2004 because I am not sure how we can run the Presidency without a back-up. There is no immediate need for it, but it will be necessary in 2004. If what happened last year happened during an Irish Presidency, we would be a laughing stock. We cannot allow that to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Presidency in 2004 will be critical depending on whether, arising from the intergovernmental conference, another treaty emerges during it. Has there been any occasion in the past where the Government jet was used for the transportation of refugees back to their home country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the cost effectiveness of travel arrangements organised by Departments other than the Taoiseach's? How does that cost effectiveness compare with that of his Department? I understand that &euro;10,000 is the cost to hire a private jet to go to Nigeria. Will the Taoiseach say whether it would be more cost effective to use the Government jet? Has the Taoiseach had the chance or thought to measure the impact on greenhouse emissions of the Government jet and is there a way of offsetting that which the Taoiseach's Department could offer as an example to the rest of the Government? To do so would indicate that he is aware of the impact and has a plan to ameliorate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The last part of Deputy Sargent's question is a technical matter for the Department of Defence, but if there is something we can do, I am not averse to doing it. I will mention it, although the Department may already have looked at that. I am in favour of leading by example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We try to avoid chartering jets because it is very costly. My role is to approve a visit, but the Department of Defence looks at the optimum mode of transport in the context of its requirements, including distance to be flown, size of the travelling party and the need to undertake internal flights in the country being visited. Requirements of flexibility in carrying out a programme can make it necessary to charter a plane and that is done through a tender process conducted by the Department of Defence. Planes have been chartered a number of times, but not too many and we avoid doing so unless it is absolutely necessary. A plane was chartered for the recent African journey mentioned by the Deputy on the advice that it was the most effective way for the President to make that trip in as short a period of time as possible. From my experience, we would <Col N="357" />rather stay with the Air Corps &ndash; whatever about its aircraft, we would always rather be with our own people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 881 freedom of information requests were received by my Department between 21 April 1998, the date on which the Freedom of Information Act came into operation, and 22 November 2002. Of these, 107 requests were refused, 270 granted, 209 part granted, 57 transferred to other Departments and 60 withdrawn. No records were held in respect of 158 cases and 20 cases are ongoing. Records indicate that 700 requests, or 80%, were answered within 28 days of receipt and a further 28 were answered within one to three days of the deadline. The majority of the remaining 153 requests unanswered within that timeframe were answered in accordance with the time limits of the Act in relation to third party consultations and searches or by agreement with the requesters. All requests received in my Department are processed in accordance with the Act, the implementation of which is kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Freedom of Information Act has proven very worthwhile in terms of the range of information supplied under its provisions. It does down the business of parliamentary questions which have become inane and practically useless. If the parliamentary questions system were more open and relevant the number of freedom of information requests would decline markedly. It used to be the case under different Taoisigh, and perhaps during the Taoiseach's initial term, that Secretary Generals were advised to give as much information as was useful in the case of parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what kinds of requests for information were refused? Is it the case that the information requested was too sensitive or strictly outside the remit of the Taoiseach's Department? On 24 September last, Fine Gael sent requests to all Departments under the Freedom of Information Act, but the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform have not yet responded. The delay has greatly exceeded the 28 <Col N="358" />day deadline, on which the Taoiseach might like to comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle An Ceann Comhairle">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I point out to the Deputy that those are two statistical questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach gives many statistics in his answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following the practice of giving as much information as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act, decision-makers are independent in the exercise of their functions while provision is made for internal review and for subsequent appeal. I have no role in the processing of individual requests which is not something Ministers and Ministers of State should involve themselves in. The requests come in and should be processed according to the legislation and I have no hand or part in the replies or papers provided. I do not even see them, although I could. A month after issues are dealt with, I am given a list of what went out, that is all.</P>
      <P>I am sure it is in order to discuss detail. Public bodies have 28 days to process requests and inform the requester of the decision that has been taken. The Act allows for an additional 21 days if there is a need to undertake a third party consultation and for an additional 28 days if the records relating to the request are so numerous as to make the standard four week period an unreasonably short research time or if the number of other requests relating to records is of significance. There can be a time lag, although my Department tries to answer as quickly as possible if the matter is within its remit. Requests are only refused if we do not have the information or if the request is not relevant. Sensitivity is only a factor with regard to section 25 which allows for certificates to be exempt and protects extremely sensitive or serious material from release. The only cases of that relate to security matters, of which there are very few and I have none.</P>
      <P>Every six months in such cases there must be a formal review of the request by a committee which I sit on with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attends if necessary. Other than that the information has to be given. I will ask somebody to pass on the Deputy's remarks about two of my colleagues who have not responded to requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Freedom of Information Act is being undermined by the extent of the backlog of appeals? There are 600 cases pending, some of which date back to 1999. What possible use can it be to get information three years after the request has been made? Is the Taoiseach aware that the commissioner has ascribed this backlog primarily to the non-filling of essential posts in the Office of <Col N="359" />the Ombudsman? The purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to make available appropriate information speedily, but its provisions are effectively stymied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the entire period since the legislation was introduced, 107 requests have been refused by my Department. I cannot go into detail on all of those because I do not have it here. The requests were refused on foot of exemptions provided for in the Act, such as section 19 exemptions which deal with meetings of the Government.</P>
      <P>As far as I can remember there has been only one appeal. Maybe there are others but other than what is in the Act certainly my Department is not guilty of using the appeal mechanism. If we have the information we have it, if we can get it from third parties we get it. Either most of those 107 would be Government business or we do not have any records whatever.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that the staffing level of that office has been substantially upped in recent years. I am not aware of any difficulty in relation to FOI requests.

What happens in his Department if he is having discussions with the British Prime Minister on <Col N="360" />issues such as this in terms of the record keeping because under the provisions of the Act there ought to be a record or a minute or a note?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Ó Caoláin, the figures for refusals are quite low. In my Department they are about 12%. When one takes out what is Government business or information that is not available, the figures are quite small. I know the general point the Deputy is making. The process that operates is that when a letter comes in seeking information, it is logged and sent to the relevant person in the Department who endeavours to reply very quickly. More than 80% of requests are responded to within the 80 days, a further percentage are responded to within one or two days of the detail being provided and those unanswered after that involve third party searches or may be Government information.</P>
      <P>Normally, a minute or details of a meeting, as mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd, with Mr. Blair would be published. Sometimes at European Council meetings we meet on the fringes during the session when there is some item on the agenda on which we have already spoken. In that case there would not be officials so there would not be a logged note. In the normal case, during the formal sessions there certainly would be a logged note. We had a debate about them recently but we will not go into that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked about the time lag. The original legislation provided for a five year period. The high level committee looking at this will look at all these issues. I have my own view on the five year rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships, which provides support to a Cabinet committee, continues to meet on a monthly basis, with the most recent meeting having taken place on 13 November.</P>
      <P>A particular focus of the team's work currently is on financing of infrastructure priorities over the remaining lifetime of the NDP. Obviously, that work involves consideration of the provisions in the Estimates, the main areas for action identified by the social partners in the negotiations on a successor to the PPF and the ongoing process of framing options and proposals for budget 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the overall aim of the Government to continue in a sustainable way the very good progress and delivery momentum that has been achieved so far under the NDP. In that regard, particular <Col N="362" />account needs to be taken of the scale and nature of accumulated infrastructural deficits that the plan was designed to tackle and the many other priorities &ndash; especially social protection provision &ndash; that must be addressed in the current circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is absolutely critical for the future development of the country. Goodbody consultants did a report on the inadequacy of infrastructure recently. The report points out that the infrastructure deficit is of the order of &euro;80 billion. It further points out that the PPP system is effectively stalled and will not be able to continue to any great extent unless serious changes are made. It further identifies that there are now 28 major infrastructural projects in the pipeline that are effectively suspended. Will the Taoiseach initiate an immediate audit of the priority projects that can be concluded within the lifetime of the current national development programme and have such audit published within three months and get on with the job? On the one hand it is false economy to suspend and stifle this kind of work, but given that the Government is talking about special strategies, decentralisation, outreach education programmes for the balanced and proper development of provincial Ireland and given that these major projects are stalled on the other hand it creates mayhem in the public mind. Does the Taoiseach intend to review the ineffectiveness of the PPP system as it stands and when might he announce changes to make it more attractive for the private sector to become involved in this kind of activity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions. It is important to note that excellent progress has been made given the scale and the nature of what Deputy Kenny rightly said are accumulated infrastructural deficits in the NDP and that it is designed to tackle many of the priority projects and projects that have been there from ten to 40 years for understandable reasons as there were no resources. The figure on the national development plan up to the 2002 period is several hundred million euro. I cannot recall the figure off the top of my head but certainly it is a long way ahead of what the figure was for that period. The reasons for that, which I mentioned before, were untimely and inadequate release of funds for projects, diminished unit of output per euro for investment relative to the original plans, constraints on Exchequer funding, planning delays and other issues. Construction price inflation was the most significant reason. This year overall capital expenditure is down by 6% but, at &euro;5.3 billion, is still 170% of what we were spending just a few years ago. Comparing that to international levels of spending, we are spending 4.5% of GDP on capital investments, whereas the EU average is 2.3%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, Deputy Kenny is right about the large number of major infrastructural problems with which we must deal. Some of them can <Col N="363" />be dealt with by State agencies within their own environs. Some will have to be dealt with under the national development plan. It is clear now that it will be impossible to deal with all of them within the expected timeframe. I have admitted that a number of times in the course of the past 12 months. However, in regard to health infrastructure, investments in school buildings, water, sewerage, public transport and other areas, it will be easier to do what Deputy Kenny suggests after the budget. The Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure is engaged in an ongoing trawl across all areas. It knows what work is outstanding for the next decade, what large projects there are, NRA, ESB, CIE infrastructure and so on. The information is available as the Cabinet committee published a document last year. It may not have been a complete one, but I will raise the issue again &ndash; there should be no difficulty in doing this.</P>
    <P>On the question of public private partnerships, some countries took off with enormous steam but have now practically stopped. Others have been slow to embrace the concept. We do not have many projects here. Some have been successful. It is no secret that the Department of Finance had mixed feelings about public private partnership and it has given its views to committees of the House. The Department believes that an excessive amount of money must be paid to the financial institutions as part of the system, that while there is a period during which no money is paid, in the end the bill of the financial institutions is excessive and that the best way to implement projects is still through the State with Exchequer funds.</P>
    <P>The Department believes that public private partnerships result in an enormous pent-up amount of money that eventually must be paid. It is an argument I have heard in unsolicited correspondence and from individuals I have met who are involved in public private partnerships here and in other countries. They believe there are other ways of doing it. The Minister for Finance has been engaged in discussions to see whether there is a way of simplifying matters. I know from Chancellor Gordon Brown and other Ministers in the British Government that the UK embarked on public private partnerships but has now back-tracked and changed its view substantially. The Portuguese were probably the leaders in this area. They did an enormous amount of work, but in a way that might be unacceptable here &ndash; they tolled all existing roads and used the tolls to fund PPPs in other areas. However, they are experiencing major problems with the EU because they have broken every rule in the book. On the other hand, they got the work done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny asked me two questions. The first was whether we would see what infrastructural projects are outstanding. I will ask the people involved to do that. The second question was whether we would examine public private partnerships to find out whether they could be more <Col N="364" />efficient. An examination is under way to see whether the legitimate concerns of the Department of Finance can be dealt with. At the same time, we cannot spend our lives not doing things if there is a way to get them done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the public private partnership model is a way of borrowing without using the &ldquo;B&rdquo; word, that it is an expensive form of hire purchase which, in the final analysis, costs the taxpayer more than would infrastructural borrowing at the outset? In looking at other countries, has the Taoiseach taken note of the unfortunate experiences in the UK, where it was reported in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper that hospitals in Cumberland, Dartford and Gravesham, which purport to be state-of-the-art hospitals, have cut beds and jobs to generate income and profit, and that the ceilings have collapsed in Cumberland because cheap plastic-joint sewerage systems could not cope and operating theatres were flooded? It indicates a sorry state of affairs and a bad report on the working of PPP.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach also agree that in Ireland PPP has not been very successful in relation to education? Is he aware, for example, that in Ballincollig Community School, the building company involved, which happens to be the company that messed up very badly in rail safety in England, has been employed to knock down a gymnasium to build another under a PPP and try to profit from that? Will he agree that this kind of PPP will do immense damage not just to the infrastructure of the country but also to the taxpayer in providing a very costly alternative to what would otherwise be straightforward borrowing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent has given us the other side of the argument. His views are in line with those of the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department would be proud of the Deputy's contribution. It is precisely as it would put the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me, perhaps, give the other side of the argument. Five primary schools were built very efficiently. I recently saw the Tubbercurry school which is built to a high standard. It carries the maintenance, the quality is better and, in spite of my good friends in the Department of Finance, the speed of work has been much quicker because it was not necessary to have five design teams, five architects, five engineers and five quantity surveyors. If five schools are being built in five different counties, each for 500 pupils, we know the country is fairly static, the people are the same, the curriculum is centralised and so on. It is, therefore, possible to have one design team to build the five schools. They will not have the same drainage system and so on, but it should be possible to cut down on the cost and carry out the <Col N="365" />work more efficiently, and that is the advantage of PPPs.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy is correct in saying that there is a large added cost at the end which makes it more expensive. However, given Deputy Kenny's estimate, whether it is right, of the extent of our infrastructural deficit, and even though we are spending almost twice as much of our GDP on capital projects as other European countries, if we took the view that there should be no PPPs and that we should only follow the capital programme, we would not, in our lifetime or in that of the next generation, get to the end of this. I would like to think we could use the capital programme. However, we should consider public private partnerships where they make it possible to carry out projects. There are ways of making PPP work efficiently, provided the companies coming in do not do so to profiteer excessively. That is the issue. I have often heard it said that public private partnership is a mechanism whereby one does not have to pay up front. The Deputy is right in saying that it is borrowing by another name and the evil day comes, as it does for all of us in our domestic lives, when the bill arrives and must be paid.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance does not like it for that reason and because there is a higher bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an even higher bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the same argument about that with people inside and outside the system. The question is &ldquo;Is it really higher?&rdquo;  A project today might cost &euro;1 million and be done for that. That adds &euro;1 million to the debt. If it is not done now but in 15 years' time it might cost &euro;20 million then. We tend to do that, but who has saved?</P>
      <P>Roads projects on which we are now working had CPOs made on them in the 1950s and 1960s. They, and the land around them, remained dormant. Because growth in the country has doubled in a decade it is possible with some greenfield projects that we can ignore these other projects. There is a case for looking at PPPs. With regard to schools the PPPs will cost about &euro;14 million less over the life of the project than with conventional building. An examination of the savings over the present school projects has shown that.</P>
      <P>There are arguments for both sides. We are not using PPPs to a great extent but we are using them in some instances and are looking at their use for other projects and trying to see if there is a cheaper way of doing them. PPPs are a relatively new system. They are less than ten years in use. Every country that has engaged in them or declined them has changed its position over the years. They are a changing mechanism. I do not believe we should go into them on a large scale but I believe we could use the system for some projects if we could get better value. However, conventional capital is clearly the cheapest way.</P>

It is an English based company called Jarvis. Is the Taoiseach aware that the same company is responsible for significant sections of the main British rail network, including its maintenance?

      <P>I hope I will be allowed the same time as everybody else. During the summer recess a non-executive director of the company resigned over corruption charges. Is the Taoiseach not concerned that this is the type of company working in Ireland in public private partnerships constructing schools and extracting exorbitant profits from our economy? Public private partnership is an expensive form of borrowing. What is the Taoiseach's view of the Government's ongoing push towards privatisation of waste management where we are handing over control of waste management and all it entails to the private sector? Will the Taoiseach respond to these questions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague has just given me information on the Ballincollig school. There were four reasons none of the bidders suggested that the existing sports hall should be kept as part of the design. The existing roof covering is made of asbestos, there was sinkage of the upright pillars, there was dampness in sections of the building and the cost of renovation of the existing dressing rooms and shower area is too high. These seem good reasons.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin, if I take the view that the private sector should not be involved, many projects would never be undertaken. I hope the Deputy understands that reality. It is easy to knock the private sector but if there is no private or State involvement the projects just go on and on and future generations will still have questions about them. Every other country has moved forward on this. The Soviet block is now a world leader in public private partnerships and investment capital. They have all given up the old rhetoric of not having any money.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a difficulty with partnerships where they make sense. Where they do not make sense it is just a rip-off. It is a rip-off when private sector companies want a PPP where the State can afford it but in areas where there is a backlog they are useful. If it was the case that we could have a meaningful public private partnership that was not a rip-off of the State and that was not excessive, would the Deputy like to see it done? I know the answer is that the Deputy would rather see it done. We cannot do it if the prices are excessive.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that PPPs give guaranteed return for minimal or no risk to the private sector for minor involvement in public projects? Studies elsewhere have shown that they are neither efficient nor cost effective. Will he agree that the reason they are more expensive is that the profits taken by the private sector are an additional cost in all cases? Does he also agree that the State can borrow money more efficiently and effectively than the private sector? Does he agree that the private sector people who want to be involved are not ragged trousered philanthropists but are in it for the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that in my replies to Deputies Sargent and Kenny. The view is that if we can afford to do it from our own capital programme it is cheaper than any other way. Deputy Stagg is right on that. People who <Col N="368" />involve themselves in PPP projects cannot do so unless there is some profit in it. The experience here and elsewhere is that in some cases an acceptable deal can be negotiated. That has happened in the case with some schools. In other cases it has been felt that the conditions being put forward do not give a good deal. The Minister for Finance has been looking to see if there are ways or means to improve on the system as in other countries. If that is not done I cannot see a future for PPPs in this country.</P>
      <P>My point about what was happening in eastern European countries was that they had an enormous infrastructural deficit and that, in what was a total turn-around for them, they were looking at ways of involving the private sector to get the best deal. There is nothing wrong with that. There are people in the private sector here who believe that they can give good value for money by doing projects quickly and efficiently. They believe that over the longer term that will prove cheaper for the State. They have a valid point and it is worth looking at for a limited number of cases.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach gave a commitment that Ministers would supply information on the revised costings of the NDP relevant to their Departments. Deputies on this side have tabled questions on this matter and no information has been forthcoming.

      <P>I will tell Ministers what the Deputy wants. The National Pensions Reserve Fund is totally independent. It is entitled to, and I hope it will involve itself in some of the major projects. If the economies of scale are big enough, its view is that the projects would be more attractive &ndash; as is the case with construction companies internationally. There are benefits in going for large rather than small projects, particularly if one wants competitive tendering. We made provision for that some years ago in the planning of the projects.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the big issues is how we fund the national development plan and how the national spatial strategy, which I understand will be announced shortly, will impact on the whole country. When speaking about this plan last week, my party's spokesman, Deputy Richard Bruton, raised the question of tolling roads, particularly bypasses.</P>
      <P>In principle, I welcome and support public private partnerships. However, there is a conflict in my constituency of Louth as a result of the decision taken by the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey. It was agreed by the National Roads Authority that a toll road would be put in place around Drogheda. When completed, this road will have a significant impact on the town. When I asked the National Roads Authority why it was tolling a bypass without allowing &ldquo;LH&rdquo; or &ldquo;MH&rdquo; registered cars free access to one of the tollbooths that were planned for my town, I was informed that it would conflict with the aims of the public private partnership &ndash; which is to obtain as much money as possible from the users of the Drogheda bypass. That is in total conflict with the needs of the local community and the whole principle of bypassing a town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to spend millions of euro on developing our road network, whether it be through the spatial strategy or the national development plan, we should not be tolling town bypasses. I regret this decision, which is a retrograde and negative step. The problem is compounded by the fact that the only proposed toll road between Belfast and Dublin is in the town of Drogheda. This is an absolute disgrace and it is unacceptable. The issue of local traffic crossing a toll or a town bypass &ndash; I refer, in particular, to locally registered cars driven by people travelling <Col N="377" />from one part of a community to another and using bypasses for their intended purpose of removing traffic from towns &ndash; should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The other issue which arises is revolves around the national development plan, the spatial strategy and the purpose for which the national development agency will actually be raising funding. I accept that the agency will be raising funding for very important regional and national strategic tasks. The result of Government policy over the past five years is that if one is travelling by car from the Meath or Louth area to Dublin city, one will, as many people discovered this morning, enter a very congested traffic area. Many Members have encountered that problem. The difficulty is that the Government has not encouraged the construction of park and ride facilities.</P>
    <P>There should be designated park and ride facilities at the entrance to major cities and urban areas where cars and other vehicles could be supervised throughout the day. I am sure there would be no problems because people would pay for this privilege. This would relieve congestion, particular that in Dublin, to a significant degree. I cannot understand why the traffic problem is getting worse and why the Dublin Transportation Office has failed to consider this singular issue, which would remove thousands of cars from city roads. It would relieve traffic pressure and make a significant difference in terms of allowing people to commute to work on time and be able to do their jobs properly.</P>
    <P>When projects are being picked by the national development finance agency or by the Government, one of their major priorities on the approach roads to cities &ndash; particularly on those from the north of Dublin or counties Louth or Meath &ndash; should be to put in place park and ride facilities. It is a silly that traffic is backing up almost from Dublin Airport, through the Swords and other roundabouts. I know that there are new lanes on that road, but there is still a bottleneck. No matter where one goes, one comes into that bottleneck and that shows short-sightedness on the part of those responsible for the road.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which arises with regard to the use the money collected by the national development finance agency could be put. People living on the east coast who travel on the rail network between counties Louth and Dublin are aware that, due to line capacity and signalling system constraints, only 13 trains per hour can pass through Connolly Station. That is the maximum number of trains that can be dealt with and it has already been achieved. There is no provision, under current policy, the national development plan or any other measure, which would allow for an increase in the rail capacity on the northern line. That is unbelievable and it makes no sense.</P>
    <P>Government policy has facilitated the development of the urban sprawl on the east coast. Many thousands of new houses are being built adjacent to the northern line in counties Dublin and Louth and also in County Kildare. Why does the <Col N="378" />Government not increase rail capacity on the northern line by adding a new set of tracks? I presume such a development would have to be run underground, but we need a major improvement in our rail capacity in order to carry the thousands of people who need to commute. We want these commuters to use our rail rather than road transport. It will cost millions of euro, but delays mean that millions have already been wasted.</P>
    <P>The length of people's working day is being extended because of delays. In my home town people get up as early as 6 a.m. to catch the 7 a.m. train into the city for work. They arrive home on the train late in the evening, squashed and fed up. There has been a development in the quality of transport. It has improved significantly, but capacity is being constantly reduced because more and more people are crowding in to smaller and smaller spaces. If one is at Pearse Street station at 5.13 p.m. on a weekday, one will see an unbelievable rush for the Drogheda train as thousands of people struggle, or fight in some instances, to get on it.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, Iarnród Éireann and the Ministers who were Iarnród Éireann's masters at the time decided to increase the height of the railway bridges on the northern line. One could not travel over the bridges for some months as they were being altered. The bridges were not raised high enough to make a significant difference, however. The carrying capacity of trains could have been increased by 40% if bridges were raised by a slightly greater height, as we could have acquired double decker trains, similar to those seen in France and elsewhere in Europe. Passengers can sit comfortably on two levels of transport in such trains. Those who plan these massive investments must have their eyes closed in many respects. We need to examine the possibility of raising the height of bridges over railway lines so the capacity of trains can be increased by 40%. There are many positive aspects to the national development finance agency, but there are also some questions about what it is going to do. I do not know if lateral thinking is practised in Departments, but we have to think imaginatively about finance problems. Traditional views should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>As our finances become scarcer, the important question of regional development should not be ignored. The national spatial strategy is due to be published tomorrow, so my remarks may be premature. The allocation of resources to regions that do not already have them is a matter that the NDFA will have to address. It is good and healthy that regions should be identified for growth and massive investment. The weakness of the spatial strategy, if what I hear is true, is that towns like Drogheda will be ignored. While I welcome the suggestion that Dundalk is to be given city status, the fact that Drogheda will not be mentioned in the report is disgraceful and unacceptable. The leaked copies of the strategy in <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>The Sunday Times</i> suggest <Col N="379" />that certain towns, like Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore, will be grouped. Such towns are valid centres of development and are worthy of increased infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>Drogheda had a population of over 30,000 people at the last census and is the largest town in Ireland, so it is shameful that it should be ignored. A great deal of thinking needs to be done in relation to this Bill. Further significant and worthwhile projects will be undertaken in the context of the national spatial strategy, but I do not want places like Drogheda to be ignored. As it is so near Dublin, it is seen by some Ministers as a commuter town where people sleep but do not work. It is not being given priority status by the Government and is suffering due to the fact that it is included in neither the spatial strategy nor the plans for the greater Dublin region. Those who completed the Dublin plan have acknowledged that Drogheda needs to be included in future plans, but it is not part of any current plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is important that we consider the Bill against the background of the recent publication of the Estimates and the prevailing global economic situation. It is a fact that the international economy is in decline. The Japanese economy has suffered from deflation in the last ten years and the serious problems in the United States directly affect this country. Within the European Union, one need only examine the stagnation that has taken place in Germany's finances to understand that Ireland cannot emerge unscathed from the economic downturn. The international difficulties I have mentioned have clear effects on how we do our business. One of the national newspapers reported last week that New York is in debt to the tune of almost $6 billion, having spent huge amounts of money in previous years.</P>
      <P>We need to concern ourselves with how we manage our affairs and with the economic strategies to be pursued. Our actions now, needless to say, will have an impact on future events. I said publicly some time ago that the Minister for Finance should be prudent when he compiles the budget. I still believe that he should be his own man and not bow the knee to vested interest groups. The Book of Estimates was presented in light of the negative impact of the global economy on Ireland, as I have outlined. Our economy is tightening considerably as a result of developments elsewhere. I ask that the funds given to each Department be spent in a manner that protects the less well-off in society. Expenditure should acknowledge the infrastructure deficits that exist throughout the regions. It is not too big a request to make to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and his ministerial colleagues who will spend the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When looking at how we can save money and deliver services in a more efficient manner in the future, there is a need to reflect on how the funds <Col N="380" />allocated to each Department are being spent. The Revenue Commissioners collect public money by way of taxation in an efficient manner. Revenue is the only sector of the public service that seems to be totally interested in information technology and it is improving its take from the taxpayer by virtue of its increased efficiency. The Revenue Commissioners offer incentives, in the form of an extended term of payment, to those who take advantage of on-line services when making payments.</P>
    <P>Although taxes are collected efficiently, I wonder how efficient we are when we spend the funds that are collected. I urge that we seek greater efficiency in our expenditure. The value for money flag should be raised over Leinster House and every other Department and State agency. We should scrutinise how services are delivered in each Department with the aim of determining whether we are receiving value for money. If we realise that money is being wasted we should do something about it, as there is little point in spending it in an inefficient way. We must address the problems in the public service to ensure that services are properly delivered to customers and clients.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of inefficiencies in areas like local government and health. We have spent too much time debating these issues in the House without making any changes. The day has come to tackle the big issue of public service structures to see if we are getting value for money. The National Treasury Management Agency is one of the better examples of an efficient public body. It was set up by the Minister to manage our national debt and has proved to be successful. I do not understand why we cannot achieve the same change in our public service, get value for money and bring about a better production line in the public services in the interest of the public.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency is a good example. It is recognised not just here but outside this country as being an efficient agency and has brought about significant change in our national debt. I would hate to be paying back the same amount we were six years ago in the current set of economic circumstances. The NTMA has done great things for the country. I am delighted that, because of this Bill it will be used, independently and within a legal framework, to help establish the national development finance agency which will draw on the expertise of the national debt management team and others. Far too often we set up agency after agency outside the House, not recognising that sometimes the work overlaps. When that happens, consultants from one field or another are brought in and paid a fortune. That will not be the case here. This team is established and we can make use of their expertise and years of experience.</P>
    <P>The role of the national development finance agency is critical for our economy. We are asking it to bring together the best brains for managing finance on the various national projects we <Col N="381" />undertake. I hope that when it is established we will not see the overspend we have seen in other projects over the last few years. Over-spending of &euro;14 million has been reported. It would not be tolerated in the private sector. Late delivery of services would not be tolerated either. A set time for the delivery of services and penalties for failing to comply with this is the norm in the private sector. That is the kind of commercial attitude we should be adopting in terms of the public sector &ndash; how the NTMA and the national development finance agency do their business.</P>
    <P>The delivery of infrastructure will not move away from the various Departments &ndash; the responsibility for delivery of infrastructure is part and parcel of what each Department will do. The Departments will prioritise the lists and the national development finance agency will decide how best to finance any project or piece of infrastructure. Its remit should cover the kind of contract necessary, on behalf of the State, to deliver the project on time and within budget. Looking up various pieces of information on this Bill, I noticed that the public private partnerships &ndash; of which there are now more than 40 &ndash; have delivered their projects on time and within budget. This shows that the steps being taken by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, are correct and helpful to the delivery of infrastructure in the State. They have been of assistance in terms of costings and cost effectiveness of those schemes. This is important in terms of supporting the flag and gaining value for money on behalf of the general public who pay taxes and to whom we are responsible. One of the big issues in the last Dáil and in this Dáil has been the number of agencies we put together outside the House, where their activities cannot be scrutinised. This was wrong. I am glad to see that we will be able to bring this agency before the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am Vice-Chairman, and find out whether we are getting value for money.</P>
    <P>An announcement is being made tomorrow about the spatial strategy. In setting up this agency we should not forget the importance of the regions. It is absolutely essential that they be developed. There is a need in my constituency for the completion of the ring road around Kilkenny. I ask that this agency set about prioritising projects, in conjunction with the Departments and look beyond. To obtain value for money we must look at what the project will deliver. The completion of the ring road in my own county would enable significant economic development. We have been lagging behind the rest of the country because the last Government and this one have not delivered. The reason for this was that another State agency, CIE, would not allow the land to be released so that the road could be developed. Now it is insisting on carrying out its own plans and doing a railway audit on one section, although the same audit will take place during the planning process.</P>
    <P>There is a need to remove bottlenecks such as this from the system. The likes of CIE must be <Col N="382" />told that there are real people out there to whom we are responsible and that it must stop dragging its heels on that project. The railway works order of which it speaks, as it has done for the last two years, already forms part of the planning process. It is not necessarily the duty of this agency to deal with that problem. It deals with value for money. There is one kind of value for money which depends on how a loan or lease is organised but another kind of value for money would be achieved by telling CIE to get off the track and allow that development to go ahead. If money were made available by this Government tomorrow it could still not go ahead because of the planning procedures relating to railway infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Another project which could alleviate traffic problems and would be helpful to the regions is the delivery of proper information technology infrastructure. Cabling is already in place underground in the south-east. Fibre optic cables have been laid by Eircom and Esat. I cannot understand why, when people are demanding faster access to the Internet, providers should not be made deliver on the cable that is already there. As I said last year, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, should consider the possibility of introducing a tax on unlit cable. This already applies to derelict sites, so that the person who owns the site must either develop it or release it to the open market. The cables in question are not being lit because the companies are waiting for changes in the market. Meanwhile, the country suffers. It is not just about my constituency. It suffers because people travel in cars to Dublin every day who would be able to work at home if a proper service was delivered to them. If that service were available a huge number of people would gain access to the Internet, thereby reducing the cost of doing so. Until we play hardball with these companies we will simply not get any response from them.</P>
    <P>Communities are a huge resource. Perhaps the best possible partnership is local authorities working with their local communities. Governments should recognise that work by investing in communities, and the last Government and the current Government, through its budgets, did that. It invested in family resource centres, after school programmes and the provision of infrastructure for the necessary support for local communities.</P>
    <P>I was reading about Robert Putnam's book, &ldquo;Bowling Alone&rdquo;, which gives a clear analysis of what is happening in large communities world-wide. They are losing their centres. Ireland had a centre, a sense of community and place, but because of the up-turn in the economy, it is being lost in terms of people's interaction with their community. We must revisit that structure and ensure that whatever finance is required by local communities is made available through existing structures and the unique partnership between national and local government and the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" />There are many lessons to be learned from the larger economies. Many of them are grappling with the fact that everyone is looking after number one and no one is looking out for the community. The only group for which I have lobbied consists of the marginalised, the elderly and the community. I have never sought tax breaks or tax shelters for anyone else. That group sometimes has no voice at local government level and it looks to this House to lead and to voice its concerns. That is what I do here and at local level and I see nothing wrong with that. It is a reflection on the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport and this new agency should examine the provisions for the rail network in the regions. It is a scandal that there is no commuter service from a city the size of Kilkenny. Years ago when I was in the transport business, Dublin was an hour and a half from Kilkenny. It now takes two and a half hours to get here and that is ridiculous. If this agency can change that it will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The attitude of CIE is that it conducted market research and concluded such a service was not required, even though two years previously, it told a committee of the House that it would deliver a service to Kilkenny once the logistics in Dublin were sorted out. They have not been sorted out. What kind of business is run like that? What business ignores the fact that bus after bus goes up and down the road to Dublin every day and it would be financially viable for there to be a rail service? What kind of company is the State running in CIE when we allow it to ignore that?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. It is an excellent initiative.</P>

      <P>In the explanatory memoranda, the Minister states that the purpose of the national development finance agency is to assist in the provision of cost effective finance. Will it do that or will it simply find a way round EU regulations? I welcome any means that will allow infrastructural projects to go ahead but we are play acting here because no group can borrow money more cheaply than the Government. We are using this as a means to get round the regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that this Bill will help to maximise value for money and to assess the optimum means for financing projects. There are some great ideas in it but it would be more relevant if someone was brought in to ensure Departments were run more efficiently. Deputy McGuinness raised the issue of value for money and that is the main problem we face. The agency should help to raise extra finance, the legislation will be passed and we must view it positively. We hear every day, however, that although the Minister for Health and Children increased his budget by 130% in the five years of the last Government, the Minister for Finance says the whole sector is inefficient. We must examine the structures and ensure the taxpayer is getting value for money. I received a phone call at the weekend advising that an old age pensioner living in a country cottage must find &euro;60 to finance her husband in a nursing home because the health board will no longer make finance available out of a budget of £7 billion. The people who suffer are the disabled, the aged and the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government needs to look very carefully at other areas because many consultants and <Col N="385" />friends of the Government receive all sorts of funds. I was interested in the health Estimates which indicated that consultancies will be one of the areas to be cut back. I will believe that when we receive the results at the end of the year. The whole issue of overruns in the roads area is also clear. Many Members referred to the roads infrastructure where there is a 66% overrun in costs. Have we checked out if there is the same overrun in the UK, Germany or anywhere else, because we all work within the EU? Are we checking to ensure we are receiving real value for money? In Monaghan consultants will be paid &euro;12 million just to get three bypasses ready for tender. Most of the money is already paid, yet not a sod has been turned. There has been no benefit to the roads infrastructure nor has there been any land purchase.</P>
    <P>How the money is spent is just as important as how it is raised. Pension funds are being set up and funded for the long term. The money is being invested in foreign countries to allow them to use our money to build their infrastructure and so on. Perhaps this agency will be able to find ways and means of recycling that money to ensure we get the full benefits and that pensioners, together with others, will have the infrastructure they require.</P>
    <P>Toll roads have been mentioned, which is another means of raising funds. Motorists and others must pay these tolls to private companies, which will raise money at a much higher cost than Government could. This is a way of getting round the fact that we have got ourselves into a situation whereby we must use massive borrowings, perhaps not directly by Government but indirectly.</P>
    <P>What control will the House have over this new body? We are told it will have to come before the Committee of Public Accounts. If I, or any other elected representative, wish to raise an issue in regard to the workings of that body, can we ask a question directly of a Minister here or will we go back to the situation which pertained in regard to the NRA whereby we are told the question is not relevant to this House. It is relevant to the people I represent but is this another quango which will allow questions to go unanswered in this House? I appreciate the agency must appear before the Committee of Public Accounts, but that may be just once a year or once every two years. There may be queries that I or others might need answered in the meantime and I do not see anything in the legislation that will allow for this.</P>
    <P>The health board legislation states that the Minister has overall responsibility. Going back to County Monaghan, because all politics is local, we were told that the health board is making the decisions regarding the winding down of Monaghan General Hospital and the possible winding down of Dundalk General Hospital. This seems to be the responsibility of consultants or anyone other than this House. I warn that we must be very careful when setting up this new agency that it will be accountable to this House, not just to <Col N="386" />the Committee of Public Accounts or the Minister. Members must have a right to come in here and ask questions.</P>
    <P>I want to speak for a few minutes on the whole issue of the spatial strategy and the BMW region. If there is money to be got through this agency, I want to ensure the rural regions get their fair share. Despite the fact that so much money is being spent on the port tunnel, the M50 and the Southern Cross, we are still trying to drag people into Dublin city. There are answers to some of these problems which could be funded by public private partnerships. I have advocated on numerous occasions the building of park and ride facilities along the M50. I come to Dublin city on a regular basis and when I come on to the M50 bridge immediately there is a 40 mile speed limit and that continues into the centre of the city. Usually there is an empty bus lane beside me. Surely if there were major parking facilities at each of the M50 junctions, of which there are eight or nine, much of the money now being spent on Dublin city could be saved. People could get to work on time because they could use the Luas, the bus or other transport.</P>
    <P>I understand the spatial strategy will be announced tomorrow, but will it be fair? It appears that towns like Dundalk on the east coast, which has a Minister, right along the Border to Sligo on the west coast will be lucky if they get a mention. This is extremely serious for an area which suffered so much during 35 years of conflict and was supposed to benefit much from the peace strategy. The peace strategy allowed for a cross-Border body to be set up in Cork. The BMW region must mean something to the people in that area and I urge that that be done.</P>
    <P>The swimming pool in Monaghan town needs to be improved if the whole funding of the nation, the BMW region or the peace strategy is to mean anything. That project has been funded locally for 35 years and we cannot now get a commitment from Government for improvements. Monaghan was promised an Outreach college by the then Minister two years ago and nothing has happened. There is a lack of sewerage infrastructure in Monaghan town. INTERREG funding was provided for a brand new sewerage plant but the pipes for it are not in place, that is how ridiculous things are. There will be no funding available for the next couple of years, therefore I hope this agency can raise the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>Government planning must be realistic. Because of the height of the tunnel major lorries will not be able to enter it. We must have forward planning. I hope the money which will be available through the agency, which I know will be voted through this House, will be used in a reasonable, practical and fair manner.</P>

      <P>As has been said already, the national spatial plan will be published tomorrow in Dublin Castle with much fanfare but, unfortunately, it is approximately three years too late. <Col N="387" />The national development plan is in a shambles. The physical delivery of projects is way behind schedule. Costs have escalated substantially. Work under the roads programme, for example, will cost about 66% more than estimated. There have been delays because of poor planning and land bottlenecks and there has been runaway inflation, which is eating into the money taxpayers have provided. This Bill does not tackle the problem. A durable plan is required but this plan is off the rails at the halfway stage. The leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, this morning asked the Taoiseach if the Government would use some of the resources in the National Pension Reserve Fund to finance capital projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>This has significant attractions because it eliminates the present lunacy where &euro;1 billion of borrowed money is channelled into foreign stock markets at a time when infrastructure projects are groaning for want of funding. It would ensure that any premium earned from tolling or charges for use of these assets would ultimately go to benefit the people in building up a reserve for their pensions. This Bill is poorly thought out and should be put on ice until the national development plan and the implications of the national spatial strategy are appraised, and there is an effective, deliverable and value for money plan.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister for Finance give the House an explanation of what is happening with public private partnership projects. The House was told that there were more than 40 projects in the pipeline but only a small number have so far got off the ground. Answers are required to basic questions before anything is undertaken with regard to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public private partnerships cover all forms of innovative commercial partnerships between the public and private sectors, and cover what are known as design, build, finance and operate schemes. In such schemes, a private sector contractor provides the facility and takes on its long-term operation, as well as the risk in line with a specification set by relevant Departments. The purpose, we were told, was to provide better and more cost-effective public services and to improve value for money through effective partnerships with the private sector. We were told the Government was committed to raising educational standards through the partnerships, that a range of approaches to schools and health care facilities would be promoted through this programme and that there was a wide range of benefits to the Departments and the taxpayer. We were told that PPPs would be very attractive to Government because it would save substantial outlay on capital projects. If that is the case, why is there to be an embargo on PPPs by the Department of Finance. Why are we told through the grapevine that powerful people in the Depart<Col N="388" />ment of Finance have such reservations about PPPs that they are doing everything they can to delay them and put them off the rails? Of the 40 partnerships, how many will be sanctioned this year?</P>
    <P>An example of the negative attitude of the Government to these projects is the school of music in Cork city. The school is a dilapidated product of the 1930s or 1940s and needs to be replaced. The Minister for Education and Science in June 1999 said that a new school of music would be built in Cork. I understand that, under PPP, three companies were invited to bid and, in April 2001, the preferred bidder was announced. To date no decision to proceed with the project has been taken even though the Department of Finance was on the vetting group. To proceed with the project, the students and academic and administrative staff moved out of the school. They now occupy a hotel in the centre of the city and 16 other locations throughout the city. The mayhem and disorganisation caused can be easily understood, as can the upset to students and staff.</P>
    <P>Why is this public private partnership on ice? Why has the Department of Finance not given it the go-ahead? Cork is to be the European City of Culture in 2005.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very cultural city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can smile if he likes but Cork will be without a school of music and a centre for the performing arts in dance, spoken arts and music. I accept that there is a department of music in the university but there will not be a college of music by 2005 when Cork is the European City of Culture. Will this project get the go-ahead? Will the embargo be lifted so that the school of music is ready for 2005? The deadline is 1 January 2003 if the project is to be finished by 2005. A nod from the Minister for Finance and the Department of Education is awaited.</P>
      <P>This example shows the ambiguous attitude of Government to public private partnerships. Is the Government convinced that there will be value for money from the contracts entered into under these partnerships? If so, they should be progressed and the private sector should be involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to the debate on this Bill and appreciate the courtesy of my colleagues in allowing me time. The National Development Finance Agency which the Minister for Finance proposes to create was listed in An Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The Minister told us that the function of the agency will be to finance major public projects to address Ireland's infrastructure deficit. It is also the prime focus of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which finishes one year before the next general election.</P>
      <P>The plan has been allotted in excess of &euro;51 billion over that period. In effect, the agency will borrow money on behalf of the State in a manner different to the current system of Exchequer borrowing. The agency will also be tasked with evaluating financial options for public private partnerships projects, which I strongly support.</P>
      <P>The question arises whether the agency's borrowings will be part of the process through which the national development plan will be delivered, or whether they will be in addition to that expenditure. The Irish market is not very big and the concern must be that the proposed agency will compete with private sector finance for the same projects. We know what happens when too much money chases too few goods &ndash; there is inflation. The delivery of the national development plan has led in some areas to capacity constraints in the construction industry, which in turn has led to the inflation of delivery costs.</P>
      <P>We must be careful to mark the line where the State competes with the private sector for the same money. In other words, we must be careful that investment funds raised by the agency are complementary to, not a substitute for, private sector investment. I am sure the Minister's Department has already considered these matters but I would like to have greater assurance.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is envisaged that approximately &euro;2 billion a year will be borrowed through the agency. As this borrowing will not be considered part of the Government's Exchequer borrowing figure, I understand that the European Commission may be concerned about this as it may constitute a breach of the EU regulations whereby all 15 members states have agreed to keep Exchequer borrowing below 3% of gross domestic product. As NDFA funds will be raised by the State, and presumably, therefore, State guaranteed, the EU may feel that not including them in the Exchequer borrowing returns will distort the true Government borrowing figure. We have already read in the media references to &ldquo;off-balance sheet accounting&rdquo; and &ldquo;funny money&rdquo;. I am sure the Minister is well aware of this and has given this area his full consideration. It is, however, an area that needs to be addressed in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency, formed in 1990, borrows money on behalf of the Exchequer and manages the national debt. I presume that the functions of the NTMA and the <Col N="390" />proposed NDFA will be quite different, and perhaps it would help non-experts like me if the Minister could outline the fundamental differences between the two agencies. I have heard one way of defining the difference. I believe that within financial circles the NTMA, because of the onomatopoeic sound of its initials, is known as &ldquo;Auntie May&rdquo;. I suppose the new agency will also have to have a name but unlike the NTMA the sound of its initial letters do not suggest one. In view of its proposer in this House, and also in view of its proposed bountiful nature, it will become known as &ldquo;Uncle Charlie&rdquo;. I would like to assure Deputies that I am not referring to myself.</P>
    <P>Whatever its name, it appears that we are to have a second Government agency concerned with borrowing. My reservations about the NTDA, such as they are, are not based on any fundamental objection to Exchequer borrowing. Some people when they hear the word &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; have an Orwellian reaction of &ldquo;No borrowing good &ndash; all borrowing bad.&rdquo;  Certainly there are cases where Exchequer borrowing can be bad, and in this context I think it is important to make a distinction between borrowing to finance current expenditure and borrowing for capital investment. Borrowing to finance current expenditure is difficult to defend. We have support for this view from no less an authority than William Shakespeare, when in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; the wise counsellor Polonious advises the young prince to be neither a borrower nor a lender, as &ldquo;borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Borrowing for current expenditure represents bad household management and means that we are transferring to future generations the day-to-day living costs of the present one. This is a policy that cannot be defended. However, this is different to short-term borrowing to overcome short-term problems. There will always be times where estimated tax income is less than expected and in such times some short-term borrowing is understandable. This is equitable, as in the short-term the people who get the benefit pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>We know that the Government cannot invent money. There are only two ways in which it can get it; either by borrowing or by taxation. I do not think many Members of this House advocate increased taxation &ndash; if any do, they have kept a low profile to date. Everyone in this House knows we have an infrastructural deficit. Therefore, we must borrow if we are to develop a 21st century infrastructure. Borrowing to finance capital development not only makes a great deal of sense, it is also equitable. In this case, it is the future generations who will benefit most from the investment in our infrastructure, and as borrowing is generally repaid over a period of 25 to 30 years, those who reap the benefit will also pay for it.</P>
    <P>There is no way in which annual budget resources can meet the demands of investment in infrastructure and we should not be afraid to borrow to finance this. The country needs more <Col N="391" />improved hospitals, schools, housing, water and waste management facilities, road and rail networks, airports, ports, etc., and in order to provide them we are going to have to spend a great deal of money. We have been fortunate that our infrastructural development has been aided considerably as a consequence of our membership of the European Union. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has always highlighted that in a positive way. EU Structural Funds have played a considerable part in our national development plans up to and including the current plan. Given our increased prosperity, largely as a result of such investment, we are moving towards being a net contributor rather than a net beneficiary of the EU. Therefore we must be prepared to finance our infrastructural development primarily through our own resources, and the Minister assures us the NDFA can play a significant part in this.</P>
    <P>This is not an area in which we should impale ourselves on fixed attitudes. The current national development plan stresses the need to mobilise all available funding sources. I have already expressed some reservations about the proposed agency that I am sure the Minister will address. However, notwithstanding any reservations, I acknowledge that the scale of future development will call for a flexibility of approach, and I think that the Minister for Finance, in bringing forward his proposal for a national development finance agency, is taking such an approach and is playing his part in ensuring that this country can continue to develop its infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I represent Dublin South-West which includes the areas of Greenhills, Templeogue, Firhouse and the major population centre of Tallaght. I moved to Tallaght as an employee in 1969. As Tallaght developed following the Myles Wright report of 1967, it was often said that it had the population of a city but the status of a village. That was true of Tallaght and many urban areas in that period. Tallaght changed with the opening of the Square shopping centre on 23 October 1990. I would be glad to bring any Member around Tallaght. It is a good place and a good example of how good policies on the provision of infrastructure from successive Governments can save the day. Until 1990 there were too many houses, too few facilities and insufficient infrastructure. Tallaght is now a huge city. It has a huge shopping centre which caters for leisure and shopping. It has the county hall, a major hospital, the national basketball arena and the facilities one would expect to find in a major town.</P>
    <P>While I elucidated some reservations I am not opposed to this Bill. It is a good idea and I hope the Minister presses ahead with it. I hope we will reap the benefits in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Howlin. The Labour Party will raise objections to this Bill as it sees it as a further layer of bureaucracy between the services that are <Col N="392" />needed and the Government. There is great need for the provision of funding for basic educational needs. The most obvious is the provision of primary and second level schools. There is a particular focus, and rightly so, on the appalling state of our primary school buildings. The Government's decision to cut 4% from the budget for the primary schools building programme is appalling. The education budget has been cut at all levels. Children are attending schools that do not have adequate toilet facilities, have vermin and take classes in substandard buildings without warm running water. There are schools where pupils spend their days in conditions that no one should have to endure. Many schools were visited by their local Fianna Fáil candidate before the last election and were told that money would be provided for whatever projects were in the pipeline. They are coming to us as Members of the House and telling us they were told one thing, but they do not know what is happening.</P>
      <P>I have tabled a raft of parliamentary questions about schools in different parts of the country. However, we are being fobbed off. We are being told that such schools are being considered in terms of the stages they are at, whether it is the architectural stage, the planning stage, the permission to go to tender stage or the permission to accept the tender stage. We are being told that answers will be given in January or whenever the provisions for 2003 are known. We are being told to look up the website of the Department of Education and Science to see where the school is on the list. However, such answers are not good enough for the people, particularly our young people who have been led to believe their problems will be addressed. However, those problems have not been addressed.</P>
      <P>Some 34 schools throughout the country have been inspected by the Health and Safety Authority which will publish a report. It was called in by the school, the parents, the staff or the INTO. It is not good enough that the business of the Government and the Department of Education and Science has now become the business of the Health and Safety Authority because conditions are so bad. I appeal to the Government to reconsider that decision. There is something wrong in a society which does not provide a proper school for the youngest members of its population, given that that is where they spend most of their day. There is a school in Deputy O'Connor's constituency which may have asbestos, but it has not received answers to its questions. Basic facilities should be available to all our children. The Health and Safety Authority is concerned because these are health and safety issues as well as educational ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are creating a layer of bureaucracy instead of directly addressing the issues. I was concerned about the Taoiseach's answers earlier today about private public partnerships and how they might work. It seems they will not save money in the long-term, but they will make things work more quickly. If adequate capital resources were <Col N="393" />allocated for such projects, they would start more quickly. The Taoiseach's argument that PPPs will make things work more quickly does not stand up. It is sometimes difficult to hear what he is saying about such issues, but I understand PPPs will not save much money.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor wanted to know where we would get the money. He wanted to know if we were talking about increasing taxes. Fintan O'Toole wrote a couple of interesting articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently. He wrote about the people in the upper income brackets and the taxes they pay. Despite his comment that he was not good at mathematics, he raised good mathematical questions about the number of people in the upper tax paying brackets and the amount of money being sloshed around the country on expensive items. Those questions are pertinent, particularly in the run-up to the budget. In another article he asked who the Revenue Commissioners follow for unpaid taxes. People's taxes are written off because it is considered that it is not worth the Revenue Commissioners' while following them. We must examine company law and the ability to transfer money from one company to another in an effort to avoid tax.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the property development sector which I suspect does not pay its fair share of tax. Money is often diverted into property and breaks are given for rental income etc. I am not an expert in this area, but I would like research to be done on it. There are people in the higher income bracket &ndash; I am not talking about PAYE workers &ndash; who have ways and means of putting their money into such developments and paying little tax. While there is merit in some of these projects which have led to inner city developments and improvements in other parts of the country, we must seriously examine them. People who ask their accountants where they can put their money so they do not have to pay much tax are getting positive answers. It behoves the Minister for Finance and his officials to follow money which should be in the tax net. I suspect that a wealthy section of our society is paying little tax. We should adopt a proactive approach and close the loopholes which allow tax liabilities to be transferred from one company to another instead of depriving young children of a proper school environment.</P>
    <P>I know I have focused on schools today, but other areas, such as the first-time buyer's grant and expenditure on health infrastructure, would be improved if everyone paid their fair share of tax. We have relied on the PAYE sector to finance public expenditure. That was all right when things were good, when the so-called Celtic tiger was roaring and money was coming into the Exchequer. The last Government was able to spend money because the economy had been built up during the lifetime of previous Governments. It was handed a healthy economy by the outgoing rainbow Government. However, the economy was mismanaged over the past five years. Money was wrongly spent and we are now <Col N="394" />in trouble. The simple thing to do is to cut basic items, such as primary school building funds.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, to be more imaginative. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, often prides himself on his imagination and inventiveness. However, he must be more imaginative in bad times. It is easy to be Minister for Finance when money is available, but he now faces difficulties of his own making. The Minister must consider ways to bring more money into the Exchequer from people who do not pay their fair share. That money must go into areas such as those I mentioned, particularly sub-standard schools.</P>
    <P>I object to the fact that clear information is not given to school boards of management and parents. There are lists on the website of the Department of Education and Science. However, people are fobbed off by being told they will get information in the future. However, there is no clear information about what schools will be allowed to proceed with in 2002 on the basis of the Estimates. Schools have not been given the information they require. I urge that a more transparent system be put in place so that schools know whether promises will be broken or fulfilled. Schools do not know what is happening and they need to know because they need to plan for next year. I urge the Government to ensure clarity. If the Government is going to break the promises it made before the election, it must be honest with the schools sooner rather than later. It must tell them what is happening, when the money will be forthcoming and when the children will be able to carry out their studies in appropriate surroundings.</P>
    <P>This is an affluent country compared to many other countries, yet despite our relative affluence, we are low in the league table of EU countries in terms of expenditure on public services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell) Michael McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are almost 900 civilian clerical and administrative staff employed to support the Garda. In November 1997, the Government accepted in principle the recommendations set out in the report of the steering group on the <Col N="395" />efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda. The review was conducted within the framework of the strategic management initiative in the public service and the report contained a number of recommendations requiring a more comprehensive development of issues relating to the organisation, operations, financing, performance and accountability of the Garda. The potential for further civilianisation within the force was recognised in the report, which stated that it would allow for certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost, free gardaí to perform work more suited to their training and increase the operational capacity of the force.</P>
      <P>In January 1998, the Government established a new Garda SMI steering group to develop the report's recommendations for implementation. A bottom-up review group was established to focus on organisational structures and systems and the deployment of operational resources and to make recommendations to the steering group with regard to those areas. As the Deputy will be aware, in October 2001 the Government approved the report on civilianisation in the Garda which recommended a programme to civilianise 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members for operational policing. These posts are located in Garda headquarters, in the Garda college and in districts and divisions throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A working group comprising representatives of the Garda and my Department is overseeing implementation of the report and it is envisaged that posts will be civilianised on a phased basis over a number of years. The initial tranche of civilianisation has already commenced and it is anticipated that approximately 60 clerical officers will be assigned to replace gardaí at various locations shortly.</P>

      <P>A lack of funding for the additional 2,000 gardaí promised in the programme for Government is evident from the Estimates and that is the context in which this question has to be considered. I presume the Minister had a hand in authoring the justice aspect of that programme. Will the additional 2,000 gardaí be appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 49 deals more directly with that issue, but I see the connection between civilianisation and the operational strength of the Garda. I accept the Deputy's implication that to argue civilianisation of functions releases more gardaí to perform operational duties would not be to comply with the letter of the programme for Government. I am anxious to progress civilianisation as an aim in itself. Recently, the rifle and gaming lobbies visited me and pointed out that there are 200,000 licensed firearms which are administered by the Garda. Allowing one hour per licence per annum, which would be the minimum paper pushing operation, means that 200,000 Garda man hours are being <Col N="396" />wasted because 100 gardaí are obliged to devote themselves full-time to a licensing system which could be administered by civilians under Garda supervision. That is just one of the areas in which I hope to be able to move gardaí from behind desks to operational areas.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point and I will reply to it when responding to Question No. 49. Additional resources will be required to increase the strength of the Garda as set out in the programme for Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take that as a &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but we shall wait to see what the Minister has to say later.</P>
      <P>Able bodied gardaí are performing desk duties in divisions throughout the country when they should be out on the streets. Every garda to whom I have spoken is very concerned about this state of affairs. The Minister used the good example of firearms licensing, but there are plenty of others. The fines system has expanded over the past five to ten years and there are gardaí dedicated full-time to it who could be put on the beat.</P>
      <P>The process of bringing civil servants to particular stations has to be considered. Ideally, the Commissioner should be the one to hire these people and it should be done on a micro level to ensure that a divisional superintendent can choose employees locally. That is important because in many cases civil servants from Dublin will not be suitable candidates to work in these stations.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy. It is desirable in the upcoming managerial revolution in the Garda that the maximum devolution of operational competence to divisions should take place. That will allow choices to be made effectively, rather than in a top-down, ideological way.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dulcet&rdquo; is hardly the word.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply says nothing. He states that he is finalising reports and he expects to bring proposals before the Government shortly, which is the sort of thing that has been said a million times in the House when nobody knows what the outcome will be. The Minister will have seen the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme which was shown a month ago and in which very serious questions were raised in relation to the Archdiocese of Dublin. Allegations have been made that the Archbishop and members of his staff may be hindering investigations into child sexual abuse by clerics.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated subsequently that he was finalising proposals in relation to establishing an appropriate inquiry. Presumably nothing has taken place since then. There is enormous public disquiet about this matter. These are the most vulnerable, young children who have been abused. We have seen how communities in recent weeks&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;have expressed their disquiet by actually marching where they thought one of the most serious abusers was being housed by the archdiocese. When will an inquiry be set up to deal with this issue in the Dublin archdiocese? Does the Minister intend to have a specific inquiry into one diocese or one archdiocese, or a national form of inquiry into child sexual abuse throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can elaborate a little. I propose to bring before Government, as soon as next week I expect, proposals outlining a scheme of non-tribunal type inquiries. I do not want to go any further than that. This is to allow for inquiries with statutory powers which would not be tribunals of inquiry. In relation to the particular matter raised by the Deputy, the child sex abuse issue, I have noticed media reports to the effect that there was apprehension that evidence might not be forthcoming or that it might be destroyed. As the Deputy is aware, Detective Chief Superintendent Camon is in charge of a large team which has been assembled to inquire into these matters. I have been assured the investigating members are satisfied with the level of co-operation they are receiving from the archdiocese. They have experienced no problems in that regard and there is no evidence of any kind to date that documents are being disposed of or destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the scope of an inquiry, at this stage it is premature to attempt to describe in detail the approach I would favour. For the Deputy's assistance I imagine it will be into the systemic aspect of child sex abuse and how it was <Col N="398" />dealt with rather than an attempt to catalogue comprehensively every single case and investigate every single case of alleged child sex abuse. This is for one reason only, as the Deputy will appreciate, if I go down a Laffoy II inquiry in which every single case has to be investigated on a case by case basis as in the statutory inquiry, not the Garda inquiry, the process could take years. This is a matter on which many on all sides of the issue want closure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has certainly given me much more information in the supplementary than in the initial reply. I would almost need to set up an inquiry to find out the information. The Laffoy inquiry has come to a standstill due to lack of information and lack of co-operation by those being investigated. By and large I agree with the inquiry being systemic rather than broken down into different dioceses, although the archdiocese of Dublin is very large and it might be necessary to look at it separately. Will the Minister assure me the new inquiry he is contemplating will have powers to compel co-operation by all those who will be subjects of the inquiry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions my predecessor outlined to the House in some detail the background to this case. I refer the Deputy to his response to Question No. 11 of 21 February 2002.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that two persons initially confessed to the crimes in question, one of whom subsequently withdrew his confession. Following consultation between the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the first person to confess was charged with one of the murders and was remanded in custody at a special sitting of the Dublin District Court. Subsequently, the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that criminal proceedings against this person be discontinued.</P>
      <P>A file concerning the second person was subsequently submitted to the director who decided no prosecution should take place. I have no function in relation to the prosecution of offences. That is the responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions who is independent in the exercise of his functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I discussed this case at some length today with the Garda Commissioner who has advised me that he proposes very soon to communicate with the families involved and to bring certain matters in relation to this into the public domain as soon <Col N="399" />as he can. I ask Deputies to bear in mind that the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Byrne, stressed that in that case he is to some extent constrained by the fact that there are still some outstanding prosecution issues involved and he does not want to do anything that would prejudge those matters. In fairness to the families involved and pending further discussions with the commissioner, I should defer final decisions on the question of further inquiries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister took the trouble, which I do not think his predecessor did, to discuss this case at length with the Garda Commissioner. The Minister will accept this case is almost universally regarded as involving a very serious miscarriage of justice in regard to Dean Lyons, the first person to be charged with what were probably the most horrific murders in the history of the State. There has been considerable media comment on this case, none of which has been refuted. For example, it has been stated that the statement of Dean Lyons contained information that was only available to the murderer and to the investigating gardaí. If it was subsequently found he was not involved in the murder, one of the few logical conclusions one can reach is that the gardaí helped shape his statement in a manner in which they were then able to prosecute him.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested in the media that the statement of Dean Lyons was a precise chronological, accurate, coherent account in a manner that was way beyond the ability of a confused heroin addict who was only semi-articulate to deliver and that that account was delivered when he was not being recorded. Does the Minister accept there are very serious issues involved in this case which point to a major miscarriage of justice involving Dean Lyons and that that has to be cleared up once and for all, particularly in the context of other cases in recent years where statements of persons charged were found by the courts to have been interfered with by gardaí?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the situation is that the former Assistant Commissioner James McHugh carried out an inquiry into the matters raised by the Deputy. In the course of that inquiry he came to certain conclusions which are now being studied by the commissioner. The commissioner has spent some time personally addressing these issues because of their importance. It would appear the Deputy is correct in one respect, that some of the confessional material was not video recorded whereas other portions of it were. An explanation has been tendered for that. As I understand it, as part of the investigation, there will be some expert psychological evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the first time this has happened. It always raises questions. I share the Deputy's view that having two inconsistent confessions from two different sources to the same offence raises very <Col N="400" />substantial questions in everybody's mind. However, it is not necessarily the case, and I would only put it this far and no further because I personally have not seen any of the documentation, that such events are always explained by one phenomenon only, the fabrication of evidence. Confessions are sometimes tendered by psychologically vulnerable people which later turn out not to be correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says. That is why an inquiry is required. If Dean Lyons had been a person of influence or affluence, this inquiry would have been held a long time ago. Because he was a homeless heroin addict in Dublin, nobody seemed to care or want to know about what even a casual glance at the very fine investigative work demonstrated by Jim Cusack, the then security correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> would show was needed, namely, an inquiry. While I welcome the Minister speaking to the Garda Commissioner and the Garda Commissioner's response, surely the Minister accepts it is a belated response, years after the event. The charges against Dean Lyons were finally dropped in 1998 and the Garda Commissioner has seen fit to respond to the Minister only now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point about the vulnerability of marginalised people. Obviously people in such circumstances do not have as many champions in civic society or in the media, in the first instance at any rate, as ought to be the case. I would, however, ask the Deputy to bear in mind that in relation to his point about the belatedness of the response to the matter, I am dealing with it as expeditiously as I can, but from a distance. The delay was partly occasioned by the fact that prosecutorial decisions over which I have no control had to be made in relation to all these matters. There is a great illusion that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform directs Garda operations and makes day-to-day decisions about prosecutions and the like, but that is not the case.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the provisions regarding search warrants in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, are causing serious practical difficulties in carrying out searches for stolen property due to the requirement that such warrants must now be issued by District Court judges instead of peace commissioners.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23849/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, section 48 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, provides for the issue of a search warrant by a judge of the District Court. Peace commissioners are not authorised to issue search warrants under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" />Prior to the introduction of the Act, the Garda Síochána had been advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions to seek search warrants from a District Court judge and that only in the cases of emergency and where it is unavoidable should a warrant be sought from a peace commissioner. The requirement inserted in the 2001 Act that search warrants be issued by a District Court judge was based on legal advice received by my Department. This was to the effect that the search warrant should be issued by a judge when it applies to offences which carry a sentence of five years or more which is the case with most offences under the Act.</P>
    <P>The requirement is in line with the policy on search warrants which has been pursued for some time in relation to other legislation. Examples include section 55 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, section 14 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, and section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, which contains a general provision on search warrants.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Courts Service is not aware that the introduction of section 48 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act has caused any particular difficulties regarding availability of judges. I understand that the Garda authorities are currently assessing any difficulties experienced in obtaining search warrants under the Act. I am prepared to carefully consider any proposals they may wish to make, but so far it has not been represented to me that the requirement in question has caused them serious practical difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised. The Courts Service has obviously not been talking to Garda superintendents. I am told that it is the case, although not so much in urban areas, that the Garda is having extreme difficulty in finding district justices to issue warrants. Maybe that has not been relayed to the Minister. The district justice for Waterford, for example, resides in Dublin and must physically go to the location in question. In one instance the judge asked that the court clerk be present, which added another hour to the wait. In many cases, the Garda reacts and relies on intelligence and must act quickly. Any delay is unacceptable if the Garda has intelligence and wants to move in and search a particular location. There is a huge problem here. The Courts Service is wrong and superintendents and senior gardaí have been telling me that is the case and that the change in the law from peace commissioner to District Court judge is causing extreme difficulties for gardaí on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear in mind what the Deputy says and I am grateful to him for bringing it to my attention. If the practical difficulties mentioned by the Deputy are manifesting themselves, I will very soon be so informed by the commissioner of the Garda Síochána or other Garda officers. It strikes me that there may be other ways of dealing with the issue. It may be that tele<Col N="402" />communication application for warrants involving fax machines, phones or audio-visual conferencing of some kind would obviate the difficulties to which the Deputy refers. The real question is the policy issue. Would the public be satisfied with a reversion to peace commissioner warrants, which have in the past been the subject of criticism, whether fair, or should we move the matter forward in a different direction to meet a practical difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be preferable to go in a different direction. However, there is massive inconsistency. When it comes to misuse of drugs a district justice is not necessary and the garda can go to a peace commissioner. In the case of an offence against the State, a garda superintendent can issue a warrant. There needs to be some consistency in issuing warrants. Currently there is not. The change in the law has made this worse because there is massive inconsistency in treatment as between a misuse of drugs issue and a warrant for stolen goods. That inconsistency needs to be rectified because it is causing problems. If we are talking about going in a different direction as far as the whole area is concerned, that is well and good and needs to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the purposes of having a third party, a judge or a peace commissioner in the past, or a senior garda officer, was to distance the warrant granting function from the investigation. The more independent and the greater the intellectual distance between the people carrying out the investigation and the people whose job it is to ensure that warrants are properly sought and are not handed out lightly, the better in principle. I agree with the Deputy that under the Offences Against the State Act and other statutes, it is possible for senior members of the Garda Síochána to issue warrants, apparently without constitutional frailty. What we are dealing with here is the quality of the administration of justice and the quality of safeguards for people's homes which are protected under the Constitution in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Greater distance causes delays. In these cases time is of the essence and the Garda needs to move quickly. The fact that a particular person lives 100 miles away creates massive delays. That is what I am told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point. There may be different ways of addressing that problem without allowing the Garda to issue warrants in cases such as this or, alternatively, without reverting to the peace commissioner mode. I will look at the matter and receive advice that is available from any source as to how practical difficulties can be addressed but, as I said, I have not been formally requested by anybody to address it until now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána by a further 2,000. Increasing the strength of the force, which is now almost 12,000 on foot of a previous commitment, by 2,000 would represent an approximate 16% increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána and, as such, it will be appreciated that a sufficient element of planning is required to effectively implement the commitment.</P>
      <P>As I previously informed the House, my Department wrote to the Garda authorities and requested them to identify the key issues which arise in the context of the implementation of the above commitment. Consultation is required not only with the Garda authorities but also with the Office of Public Works and the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the Government commitment in this matter represents a significant challenge for the Garda training college at Templemore. The college currently accepts 500 to 550 trainees per year and has a maximum capacity of 650 trainees per annum. As the annual intake required to implement the commitment would exceed the current capacity of the Garda college, consideration is being given to increasing its physical capacity and to the provision of additional resources so that the maximum training capacity could be increased. In addition, such matters as the need for extra civilian staff, including medical staff, whether gardaí would need to be diverted from operational duties to training, the provision of sufficient facilities for catering, physical education and information technology require to be addressed. The expanded use of students living-out accommodation may also be required.</P>
      <P>The provision for the Garda Vote in the Abridged Estimates for 2003 relates to the maintenance of the existing level of services. The Estimates are prepared on that basis. It does not, nor is it intended to, address the question of additional gardaí which is being considered separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is currently in the final stages of its examination of the detailed planning and logistical issues involved in this matter, including costs. As soon as I have finalised my consideration of those issues, I will bring the matter to <Col N="404" />Government in the usual way. The question of allocating the necessary funding to underpin the implementation of the commitment is one of the matters which will arise for consideration by Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the way they are answered. I am sure the Minister has read the annual crime report for 2001 which was published yesterday. His predecessor had it before the last general election but chose not to make the figures available. Now we know why, and another fraud was perpetrated on the people prior to the election.</P>
      <P>The number of serious crime offences committed in the past 12 months has gone through the roof. Overall there has been an 18% increase in serious crime. The increase in regard to assaults, homicides, murders and serious sexual offences is in the 80% range. It is a colossal increase and the trend is upwards. In view of that does the Minister not see the urgency of having some of the 2,000 gardaí on the beat and on the streets? The streets are no longer safe and the Minister is doing nothing about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given me precisely the same answer as was given a month ago, that he is looking into the matter. We seem to have made little progress. A month ago the Minister had written to the Garda authorities and asked them about the logistics. Why did the Minister not indicate that he had got a response from the Garda authorities and that it has been on his desk for the past six weeks or so? He has not done anything about the logistics in regard to Templemore.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not got a penny from the Minister for Finance in the Estimates with regard to putting a single garda on the street. His promises are for the dim and distant future and he has failed to get one extra garda to patrol the streets.</P>

The suggestion that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, concealed the figures is without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will elaborate for the Deputy on the issue of recruitment so that he can see the size of the problem. Taking into account normal retirements <Col N="405" />and resignations etc. from the force we would need a recruitment rate for 2003 to 2007 of 860 extra gardaí per year to get to the figure of 14,000 by the end of the full term of this Government. Earlier I said that 650 is the maximum capacity of the present facility. Clearly, significant steps, over and above what is possible in Templemore, must be taken to achieve the figure of 14,000.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has said I have not got a penny in the Estimates for this purpose. I am not here to predict what will be decided by the Government in respect of the budget. I concede that the case is as the Deputy states it. The Estimates are prepared on the basis of the existing level of service. If I am to make a start in 2003 and if resources are made available to me, progress will not be at a level which would reach the desired figure by the due date. It must be a back-loaded operation if I am to reach that. That is one of the vagaries of being a Minister and this is one of the things that must be settled at Government level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The deportation costs which I am supplying refer to the deportation of either illegal immigrants, persons refused refugee status in the State or persons whose applications for asylum have been transferred to another country under the Dublin Convention. The vast majority of the removals involved persons who were refused refugee status in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" />The number of persons deported in 2001, at a total cost of £921,114.28, &euro;1,169,573.88, was 365. In 2002, up to and including 18 November 2002, the number deported was 484, at a total cost of &euro;1,696,438.92, £1,336,054.22.</P>
    <P>The cost of the deportations in 2002 includes the cost of the chartered flight to Algeria in January and two chartered flights to Nigeria in March and November. There were no other chartered flights in either 2001 or 2002. Information in relation to the overall cost of all deportations in 2001 and 2002, in so far as the human resources cost to the Garda Síochána is concerned, is not readily available.</P>
    <P>The first aircraft was chartered to facilitate the deportation of two Algerian persons to Algeria on 9 January 2002. There were five escorting members of the Garda Síochána. The total cost to the State of chartering the aircraft was &euro;23,495, £18,500, while the Garda escort costs associated with the deportations were &euro;714, £562.</P>
    <P>The second aircraft was chartered to facilitate the deportation of six Nigerian persons to Nigeria on 28 March 2002. There were 20 escorting members of the Garda Síochána. The cost to the State of chartering the aircraft was &euro;190,000, while the Garda escort costs associated with the deportations were &euro;7,671.</P>
    <P>The third aircraft was chartered with the intention of deporting 20 Nigerian nationals but this number was not possible due to court proceedings in relation to some of the intended deportees. Twelve persons were deported to Nigeria on 14 November 2002. There were 35 escorting members of the Garda Síochána. The cost to the State of chartering the aircraft was &euro;151,500, while the Garda escort costs were &euro;14,361.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that in evaluating the cost of a charter flight for the purpose of deporting persons to their country of origin, the cost of the continued presence of persons who are the subject of deportation orders in the State has to be taken into account. These costs include social welfare, direct provision and detention costs in certain cases. The use of chartered flights is the only viable option in certain cases where there is no alternative available, either because of the disruptive behaviour of the persons being deported or other genuine concerns of the airlines who have to look after passenger safety.</P>
    <P>In some instances, the possibilities of using scheduled flights on commercial airlines for deportations has become difficult given the disruptive behaviour of some deportees. This has caused distress to other passengers on board and considerable inconvenience to the airline. If it is not possible to enforce deportation orders as a result of disruptive behaviour of deportees, there will be two main outcomes. First, it will send a clear signal that deportation can be avoided by simply being disruptive and, second, disruptive behaviour by deportees on scheduled flights will become the norm, leading to concerns for the safety of passengers and staff on aircraft and <Col N="407" />causing further difficulties for the Garda in the already problematic task of enforcing deportation orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just been doing the figures. Approximately &euro;3,000 apiece is a hefty one-way ticket &ndash; even disregarding Garda overtime. Excepting the safety issue &ndash; it is a lot of cash. How many more flights does the Minister envisage this year?</P>
      <P>We must return to the root cause of why people are coming to Ireland. It has been discussed in the context of the naturalisation issue. Does the Minister have plans to look at the issue and the reason people are coming here to have children? Is he planning to change it and debate it in the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that a judgment of the Supreme Court on the issue &ndash; on appeal from the High Court &ndash; is pending and I do not want to say anything that would be seen to be an attempt to move the Supreme Court in one direction or another. In relation to the naturalisation issue, it is the intention of the Government &ndash; as set out in the programme for Government &ndash; to take some action, depending on what is needed, once we have the Supreme Court's definitive judgment on the issue. The Government will also consult the Opposition parties as to the appropriate response &ndash; whether constitutional or sub-constitutional. Until I am in a position to advise the Deputies opposite on the implications of the forthcoming judgment, I cannot help on the matter.</P>
      <P>These deportations are expensive and it occurred to me that &ndash; putting some of the themes of today's Question Time together &ndash; we may be in a position to use non-Garda security staff to enforce order on aeroplanes rather than using gardaí. I do not know how many more of these flights are contemplated but there are no circumstances under which I will be browbeaten into abandoning these flights. If people get the message from the Government that one will not be deported if one kicks up a fuss, the system will implode. Any credibility our system has depends on the willingness of the State to enforce the laws of the land.</P>

We would be able to employ new gardaí for the cost for each individual &ndash; I understand it is between &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000 for each deportee. The Minister may as well send them on <Col N="408" />a pleasure cruise. This is not a cost effective way of dealing with the matter and it should be revisited because the ratio of three gardaí to each asylum seeker deported leaves much to be desired. Does the Minister think this is the best use of Garda resources in dealing with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is not the best use of Garda resources. The Garda Síochána is here to maintain the law in this country and unfortunately part of that law is immigration law. If the Garda national immigration bureau is to conduct its business effectively, it must make it clear that when all due process, judicial appeals, reviews and <i>ad misercordiam</i> pleas have been entertained and dealt with by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, this State is willing to enforce its law. I assure the Deputy that the result would be a massive unwillingness to co-operate with our law. I want to see people who are subject to deportation orders voluntarily quitting the State. The Deputy refers to the cost of &euro;3,000 per person but if one thinks in terms of scheduled flights from Ireland to Nigeria, that is not a vastly inflated cost.</P>

      <P>As I testified before the Joint Committee on European Affairs, the Dublin Convention is of limited practical effect. We have had less than 100 transactions inward and outward under the convention in any given year. In some years we have actually received more people under the convention than we have removed to other states. That is remarkable for a state which is located geographically where it is because virtually every person entering the State is passing through a Dublin Convention country to get here. There are evidential problems and I propose to bring to Cabinet new laws which will make it less possible to evade the consequences of the Dublin Convention.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the gardaí have extensive powers under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, to deal with late night drinking and disturbances. In addition, as the Deputy is probably aware, in June last I reintroduced the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, which had been published by my predecessor in the Department, Deputy O'Donoghue, and which is today resuming at Second Stage in the Dáil. This legislation will, when enacted, give the gardaí significant additional powers to assist them in dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct which, as most people would accept, are contributing to street crime and violent assaults. The purpose of the Bill is to augment the law so as to tackle the problem of drink related late night disturbance and the growing problem of late night street violence which has its origins in or outside licensed premises and fast food outlets. It will apply to pubs, off-licences, discos, night clubs, dance venues of all types, amusement arcades, chip shops, take-aways and mobile food vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Garda operations which target such behaviour play a vital role in combating this type of crime. Operation Encounter is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community. Particular attention is paid to night clubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there is potential for disorder. The target hours of the operation are determined locally, based on the <Col N="410" />specific circumstances prevailing at each location. Particular attention is being paid to ensuring that the owners and managers of such premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the Garda Vote for 2003 show an increase of almost &euro;19 million over the corresponding provision for 2002, which is an overall increase of 2%. It is too early at this stage to say if Garda services will be affected in 2003 as detailed budgets have not yet been prepared. However, the priority will be to maintain the existing level of front line policing services to the public by focusing on key services, increasing efficiency and getting best value for money.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the ironies of life is that the more gardaí are put on the streets at night in the circumstances referred to, the worse the crime figures appear later because more offences are detected and put into the PULSE system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should call all the gardaí off the streets and see what happens. He is using reverse psychology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Extra gardaí on the streets do not simply have a deterrent effect. A much greater proportion of crime is recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that late night opening of licensed premises contributes hugely to the problem? Has he any plans to review the decision of the previous Government in that regard? Many late night disturbances are also associated with people congregating in the vicinity of fast food outlets. Has the Minister any views on our drinking culture which, according to some commentators, is contributing to many problems in health, crime and social problems? Has the Government any plans or strategy to deal with our drink culture in terms of the advertising and portrayal of drink, especially for younger people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that late night drinking is one of the problems. In the course of a recent debate in the Seanad, I raised the possibility that local authorities might be given discretion as to their preferred bands of opening hours, either in the whole of their functional areas or in particular portions. That would make it possible, for instance, for a quiet rural town to close down, effectively, at midnight if that was the local preference, without prescribing the same closing time for, say, Temple Bar in Dublin or other places. The Commission on Intoxicating Liquor Licensing, chaired by Mr. Gordon Holmes, hopes to have its final report available to me a few months from now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the last Government extended the licensed opening hours. However, in case the blame for any consequences is directed at this side of the House, I remind the Deputy that many in his party said <Col N="411" />there should be no restrictions of any kind and criticised my predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue, for the narrowness of his perspective. In the context of public order legislation from the other side of the House, the red skirt of Galway West, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, accused me of making war on an entire young generation of Irish people by introducing these measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is simply wasting time so that we cannot put questions to him. Perhaps he is a little flustered. He is confusing detection and commission of crime. If there are more gardaí on the streets, more crime is detected but it is also likely that less crime will be committed. Does the Minister agree there is no alternative, in terms of dealing with crime, to having gardaí on the beat? Does he agree that what he has got in the Estimates to date is a 2% increase, which is less than half the current rate of inflation and that that will not increase the number of gardaí on the beat or the ability to combat crime? Further, does he agree that the crime figures published yesterday show the situation has become dire and that special urgent measures are required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally that if more gardaí are put on the streets that has two results. First, one detects more crime and, at the same time, one deters more crime. There is a combination of both factors involved. However, the exact balance is not as obvious as one might imagine. Frequently, the effect of sending out more gardaí is that, at the end of the night, more material is put into the PULSE system. That feeds into the annual report and, in the last analysis, the situation appears to be getting worse although in fact, on the basis of the Deputy's very wise observation, it is actually improving.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amount of money available, I agree the 2% increase for the Garda Síochána will present challenges. However, now is the time, in present circumstances, to allocate resources and prioritise their use to the maximum possible extent. We have to look at every available euro at all levels to ensure we get best value for money in terms of maximising on the street operational functions and reducing other functions. The message I and the Garda Commissioner have been sending out is that we have to manage this very substantial budget as best we can. He is as determined as I to ensure we get value for money in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the Minister's theory of correlation between detection and the number of gardaí on the streets, does he agree his predecessor was incorrect in stating that zero tolerance was effective in reducing crime levels? If zero tolerance had been working effectively, detection levels would have increased. Does the Minister also agree that, in addition to the issues he mentioned with regard to late night violence, it is also <Col N="412" />a matter, in many cases, of people who feel excluded hitting back at society? Is he aware that in studies carried out in some juvenile delinquent centres, up to 50% of inmates suffered from dyslexia? Will he agree to look at this issue over the next few years? I raised it several times in the last Dáil but it was not followed up. Educational exclusion at a young age often results in people hitting back at society, particularly where reading difficulties are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree completely with Deputy Timmons's comments. It is all very well to constantly focus on the response to crime and confronting crime but there also has to be another approach based on tackling the causes of crime. Those causes are manifold, as the Deputy will appreciate, and educational under-performance and drop-out are part of that. This Government and the last Government have put together a new statutory framework for the provision of education to vulnerable young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. I believe that will have a positive impact in future in addressing deprivation, marginalisation and the drug culture. These this are mutually reinforcing factors &ndash; especially in certain urban areas &ndash; which tend to suck vulnerable young males, in particular, into criminality. I agree implication in the with the Deputy's question that we must, if possible, avoid incarceration where other methods may be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the fact that there are too many pubs in certain areas contributes to late night violence and that our antiquated licensing laws are killing off traditional town and village pubs by allowing them to double and treble in size while simultaneously preventing the opening of pubs in the newer suburbs? Would he agree that an updating of the licensing legislation is an important part of the task of combating the late night violence which occurs in certain areas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues that the issue of late night drinking and problems in towns and villages is out of hand and that it is vital to have front-line staff, namely, gardaí, out on the beat. It may have been last minute cutbacks &ndash; designed to make the figures look good &ndash; that resulted in a lack of gardaí on our streets, but it is important that people are able to live in their peacefully homes. Will the Minister employ civilian staff in order to release front-line staff on to the beat to make sure that people can walk the streets? He has already admitted that, in light of financial difficulties, it will be difficult to proceed <Col N="413" />with the plan to put 2,000 extra gardaí on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the current position <i>vis-à-vis</i> crime is extremely serious? Will he inform the Cabinet that urgent action is needed because people are afraid in their homes and in the streets? People are being attacked, robbed, raped and killed. What does the Government propose to do about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Stanton's view that the current figures are disappointing and a matter for great concern. However, we must also deal with the causes of crime.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crawford inquired about civilianisation and releasing gardaí on to the beat. I dealt with that matter earlier, but I am agree with the Deputy in respect of it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cuffe that if the present licensing system is conducive to the establishment of super pubs, the capacity of the management of those establishments to control the sale of alcohol on their premises and maintain a reasonable level of sobriety among their customers is hugely impaired. I have spoken about the need to have a licensing law which does not slowly eliminate smaller pubs and replace them with larger ones. At present, it is a serious criminal offence for any publican to serve alcohol to any person, young or old, to the extent of making them drunk. The time has come for that to be brought home to publicans. They must be made aware that they cannot just shovel out drink and, if they do so, they will end up in court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make it absolutely clear that there is no question of any kind of a blanket refusal of <Col N="414" />access to Irish prisons in so far as Amnesty International is concerned. The Government and Members on all sides of the House greatly value the work of Amnesty throughout the world and continue to support its work in the interest of promoting and safeguarding human rights.</P>
    <P>What is at issue here is a joint proposal from Amnesty International and the Irish Penal Reform Trust for a research project on racism in Irish prisons. In the normal course I would be entirely disposed to facilitate the two organisations concerned in conducting a project of this kind. For example, in recent times, my Department afforded access to prisons to the Irish Penal Reform Trust access for a study of the use of segregated cells. This involved granting access to prisoners, prison staff and prison records.</P>
    <P>The proposed Amnesty International-IPRT research on racism is not being facilitated, however, for one reason, namely, that similar independent research on racism in our prisons is already being conducted by the National Training and Development Institute which was the successful applicant in a publicly advertised competition for tenders. It makes no sense to have overlapping research on racism being conducted simultaneously in the prisons by independent organisations. This view was conveyed to Amnesty International in detailed correspondence in July and September of this year. That letter also apprised Amnesty International of my view that the better approach would be to conclude the ongoing NTDI research and to proceed without further delay to design and implement a racial and cultural awareness programme for prison staff and prisoners on the basis of the research findings.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I want to emphasise that I was perfectly happy, indeed anxious, to let Amnesty know the reasons behind the decision in this case. I did this by way of a comprehensive letter of explanation. I am not sure what issue arises from the fact that I may not have been available for a personal meeting or phone call. I might add that, in the interest of openness and transparency, the aforementioned correspondence also contained an undertaking that Amnesty International and the Irish Penal Reform Trust would be provided with a copy of the NTDI research report and information on the implementation and evaluation of the programme for staff and prisoners in due course.</P>
    <P>The fact that Amnesty International and the IPRT are not being facilitated on this occasion has no implication for either organisation in their being afforded access to prisons for appropriate purposes and I reject any suggestion that the decision in this case amounts to exclusion of either organisation from any future research or other project involving prisoners. Comparisons in these circumstances between Egypt, Turkey and Ireland are simply wide of the mark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe they are that wide of the mark. The Minister has excluded <Col N="415" />those two organisations. A short time ago he had no money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not excluded anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he has. Why is the Minister so anxious to prevent two highly respected organisations, one domestic the Irish Penal Reform Trust &ndash; the other internationally &ndash; Amnesty International &ndash; from conducting, without any cost to the Government, a survey and research into the possibility of racism in Irish prisons, when he is prepared to allow such a survey to be carried out by the National Training and Development Institute? Moreover, he is only paying for the survey to be conducted in Wheatfield Prison. The other organisations were going to carry out their research in the major prisons at Mountjoy, Cloverhill, Cork and Limerick.</P>
      <P>Even if, as is obviously the case, the Minister was to continue the training programme with the National Training and Development Institute, he could have allowed the research to be carried out in the other prisons. Does he have anything to hide, or is this a form of begrudgery because Amnesty International was critical of the policies on racism of the previous Government? Prison officers have no objection to Amnesty International conducting a survey. Will the Minister indicate if there is any good reason Amnesty International is not allowed into the prisons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of the Prison Service has on many occasions permitted research of various kinds to be carried out in Irish prisons. One of the difficulties with unfettered research in Irish prisons is that they are effectively turned into research projects for people who are, no doubt, inspired by a benevolent impetus. The board of the Irish Prisons Service has set up a separate committee to evaluate all proposals for such research projects and to decide the standard that should apply to them. The committee, which is chaired by Professor Patricia Casey, takes these matters seriously. The prisons are not test benches where everybody seeking to conduct research can come and go as they please.</P>

      <P>Is it not a serious indictment of the Minister's predecessor that he would not reply to correspondence from the international secretary general of Amnesty International? I find it curious that the Minister has claimed that the NTDI is entirely impartial and objective, as the report it will write will be sent to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for viewing, vetting and possible rewriting before it is made available to the public. The importance of a truly independent study, as offered by Amnesty International, should not be underestimated. It is a matter of great concern that the report being offered by the Minister will be vetted and may be <Col N="417" />rewritten by his Department. How can the Minister assure the House that the report will be independent, impartial and objective, compared to a report of an outside, non-governmental organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Amnesty International and the Irish Penal Reform Trust are independent organisations and are free to form any judgments they like. I do not criticise them, but they should be slow to criticise a professional group of people that has succeeded, in an openly advertised tender competition, in winning the right and the obligation to conduct detailed research on the Irish Prisons Service. Deputies should be careful before they imply that anybody who is retained by my Department is not independent. Non-governmental organisations, including some that later say they are independent, sometimes come to my Department in search of financial support, so it cuts both ways. As far as I am concerned, the decision made by my predecessor was appropriate and I do not propose to be brow-beaten into changing it.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have a short period of time to speak about the National Development Finance Agency Bill, 2002. It is incumbent on Members, when a proposal comes before the House to establish a quango of the nature provided for in this Bill, to examine it carefully. This is particularly true at this time of financial difficulty, when important social programmes are being investigated, raided and wiped out and when grants to vulnerable people are being withdrawn. The Government has wielded the axe on all sorts of public expenditure and decried the notion of over-administration as one of the failings of our system. Bearing that in mind, why has it proposed to establish a new agency to borrow money to ensure that the national development plan is put in place? This task could readily and <Col N="419" />properly be done by the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
      <P>The national development finance agency, which is being established in this Bill, was devised during the general election campaign with the notion of keeping accounts off the balance sheet. It was designed to allow the Minister for Finance, when presenting himself to the electorate, to pretend that money borrowed by the agency did not constitute State borrowing. That particular wheeze has been found out by the European Commission and the Minister's justification of it, if it was ever more than a political fig leaf, no longer exists. The national development finance agency will be slotted somewhere between agencies like the National Treasury Management Agency, the National Roads Authority, which looks after the provision of finance for our roads, and the Railway Procurement Agency, which deals with procurement necessary for the development of the rail system.</P>
      <P>Why is this going to happen? As I have said, the only reasons I can think of are that the Government is determined to pursue the matter as a consequence of floating the notion in the context of the general election campaign, as well as to pretend the balance sheet is something other than it is. A new raft of individuals, doubtless all well paid, will involve themselves in a new quango to duplicate work that could readily and more properly be done by the National Treasury Management Agency. I do not see any need for this new body. If there is a real determination on the part of the Government to reduce quangos and the level of public administration, I am entirely baffled by the notion of setting up an agency that is patently unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention deficiencies that clearly exist in relation to the infrastructure that it is proposed will be provided by the new agency. I want to mention in particular the investment programme to upgrade the rail service, as outlined by the Minister for Public Enterprise in the previous Administration, responsibility for which has been handed to the Minister for Transport. With the advent of a new Department of Transport, I had hoped that a joined-up approach to public transport would commence. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is here to hear me speak about the scandalous suggestion of closing the rail line between Limerick Junction &ndash; which is not in his county but is close enough to his home base &ndash; to the Europort at Rosslare, at a saving of some &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million. That closure will cost tens of millions in its effect upon the infrastructure of the south-east and the development potential of areas across the south. At the moment 160,000 tonnes of sugar beet is ferried, during the three months of the sugar beet season, from the beet depot at Wellingtonbridge, south Wexford, to Mallow sugar factory. Should this line be closed for want of &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million? That 160,000 tonnes of beet will be decanted on to our road system, which is already collaps<Col N="420" />ing, causing further congestion in every town between south Wexford and Mallow, particularly New Ross and Waterford. The economic costs beggar belief. One hundred trucks a day in each direction will be needed to carry the beet, and this is only one type of freight.</P>
    <P>If we are to have joined-up thinking by the Government and this agency is to consider the national development plan in the round, surely arbitrary decisions made by individual agencies such as Iarnród Éireann cannot be tolerated. They can have devastating economic consequences not only for communities but for entire regions. It is nonsense. The Minister for Finance should argue for joined-up thinking and ensure that silly decisions such as this are simply thrown out by Government. This important and pivotal rail link should be maintained.</P>

      <P>It was inspected by an official of Wexford County Council and deemed to be in such bad repair that it could not be used. The courts of the land could not sit in a designated courthouse in an important town. I have given just two of the many glaring examples of the infrastructural deficiencies of this State. We have a national development plan, although I would have argued for different priorities. We need a mechanism to put the plan into effect as quickly as possible. Creating a new quango that will gobble up administrative money rather than putting tar on roads and rail under new rolling stock is not the way to go. This is the way that has bogged down infrastructural development for decades. More of the same is what we can expect from this bankrupt Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the concept of utilising all available sources of funding, including private finance, for infrastructural projects. I want to see careful consideration being given to all the alternatives to borrowing and they should be assessed in terms of value for money in the longer term as well as strategic value in their capacity to deliver quicker results in completed projects in the short-term. One of the things on which all sides of the House are agreed is that we have a major infrastructural deficit. Those two words trip glibly off the tongue, but they do not even begin to describe the kinds of difficulties we have, such as roads that do not have the capacity for the traffic they carry. Deputy Howlin mentioned the rail infrastructure, which is decades out of date and has not been carrying the kind of freight it could <Col N="421" />carry, principally because it is not an attractive option for the people who have to pay to transport freight. This is something that needs to be considered in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The new agency is to be placed under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency. It should benefit not only from the substantial experience and expertise of that organisation, but also from sources of funding currently managed by the agency, although I did not hear this in the Minister's speech. Deputy Howlin, as well as a number of other speakers, made the point that it runs the risk of being another quango with no particular powers and that the work to be undertaken by the new agency could readily be done by the existing NTMA. Anybody who looks at the range of expertise required by the new agency for advice and decisions would have to reach a different conclusion. Because of the ambit of the new agency, it must be somewhat separate.</P>
      <P>The agency should be staffed by people with expertise in corporate finance, risk assessment, project costing and management and value for money criteria. Legal and technical advice will also be required. It is hoped that substantial economies of scale can be obtained by opting for a centrally resourced expert advisory service available to local authorities and other procuring bodies. A service such as this has not been available to these bodies until now. Since the advent of the NDP, local authorities have been undertaking projects of a scale they would not have expected even in the relatively recent past. It has presented difficulties in terms of management expertise across a range of areas.</P>
      <P>It is desirable to build incrementally a valuable resource of expertise and experience in very specialised areas. It should benefit the State for many years to come because of the quality of its advice and its availability to local authorities, vocational education committees and other smaller agencies which will be involved in public private partnerships and design, build and operate projects. Local authorities and other bodies have not until now been in a position to obtain expertise in these areas. It is virtually impossible for county councils, vocational education committees, semi-State bodies and even Departments to build up and retain such expertise, partly because the kind of project for which expertise is required is undertaken fairly infrequently. The mass of projects at national level is far more likely to sustain and provide work for the experts the Minister envisages. There is a huge amount of work to be done by the agency in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From its inception the agency will be required to maximise value for money for the State. Many of the speakers today have said that they are quite dissatisfied with the application of this criterion to projects in recent years. The agency will do this not only by identifying the most beneficial financing arrangements but also by ensuring that the best commercial standards are adhered to in the areas of project costs and evaluating financial risks. <Col N="422" />This is something we simply have not been good at in the past. In some respects it is a need to which we had not even adverted. To date, most of the projects have been financed directly by the Exchequer and, up to the last four or five years, by borrowing. Since then they have been financed mainly from State revenue. There is considerable anecdotal evidence of laxity in relation to cost overruns, variation clauses, add-on elements and so on. There was at least one embarrassing episode involving an NRA project in the south of the country, which had considerable cost and related difficulties and ended up costing the taxpayer a lot more than should have been the case.</P>
    <P>I frequently hear my former colleagues on Clare County Council, as well as some of the staff, say that all projects undertaken in County Clare have come in under budget. Two large road projects have been dealt with by the NRA, Clare County Council and the regional design office. That office has been a success, dealing with projects across four local authorities. It put together expertise that the individual authorities could not have assembled. Credit is due to the county engineer and his technical staff that two major projects have been completed within budget, with minimal delay in one case and substantially within the time-frame set in the other and with the minimum of inconvenience to the public. There were unforeseen difficulties in the projects and these have been addressed with alacrity and the minimum of fuss.</P>
    <P>That augurs well for the capacity and ability of the authority to undertake the Ennis bypass project and the Gort to Crusheen project. We all run the risk of being parochial but those projects, following those at Newmarket-on-Fergus and Smithstown, are part of a critical road network in the west. They form part of the main Derry to Cork and Rosslare western corridor and will transfer some of the excessive traffic from the radial routes out of Dublin and enable the towns in the west to compete on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>They are a long way behind schedule, however, as are projects around the capital. There is increasing evidence that the radial routes in and out of Dublin are creating as much difficulty as they are addressing. Anyone who uses them frequently finds them seriously clogged. Any economic or regional policies that continue to direct huge volumes of investment, traffic, service industries and State bodies into Dublin will create enormous difficulties for the economy. They will create problems for those living in Dublin who face the daily grind of making their way through those clogged up routes and will be an enormous drain on resources.</P>
    <P>There is evidence that less infrastructure will be delivered than is provided for in the national development plan. High inflation in construction and civil engineering is a major factor in this. Those in the industry say it is caused in part by the investment in the heavy plant and equipment necessary to build the capacity required for the plan. There are others who attribute less chari<Col N="423" />table reasons for the costs of over-runs and increases on the original projected figures. There is no doubt, however, that there is now more capacity than there was five years ago. There was also competition from foreign companies and it is likely that the new agency, the NRA and the other agencies will be in a position to get better value for money over the next four years than has been the case until now.</P>
    <P>The new agency should conduct a value for money audit of projects undertaken in recent years. There is no point coming into this House with anecdotal evidence about these projects unless a professional examination of exactly what happened is undertaken. Taxpayers money is being used in these projects and the agency would be doing a valuable job. It might be expensive in the short-term but it would lead to enormous returns and would not be difficult to do. There is a demand from the public and from political sources that such an audit be undertaken and published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be the number one priority. The audit should also establish if these inflated prices are the result of the operation of a cartel. We have all heard stories of the limited number of companies in the civil engineering area which are the only companies pitching for projects and getting them as a result. The agency should seek the assistance of the Competition Authority, if required, to examine these projects. There might be no truth to the rumours that have been circulating that there is such a cartel.</P>
      <P>Practices imposed with good reason by the NRA and other procuring bodies have limited the number of Irish players in the market. They exclude new civil engineering contractors from being a party to some of these contracts, or even pitching for them. This must lead to poor value for money, a waste of resources and a burden on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The regional design teams of the National Roads Authority are a good example of the economies of scale that can be achieved and the expertise that can be gathered when local authorities come together to provide designs for their roads. Similar central resourcing would be of benefit to the new agency. Previously we have had design, build and operate systems, public private partnerships and private finance. Those are the funding options that exist besides procurement. A number of public private partnerships are already under way. The agency will need expertise to be able to assess the relative value of each option, particularly in relation to value for money. Such expertise has not been available to Departments and local authorities and we have been poorer for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience in Britain of unexpected costs and difficulties associated with the new options <Col N="424" />make it prudent for us to examine potential pitfalls. Along with its responsibility for providing funding, the agency will have a job to do in this area. It is also important that private sector involvement in financing of projects is optimised because we have a major infrastructural deficit that the public finances cannot address quickly enough.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation, State authorities will be obliged to seek the advice of the agency but not obliged to take it. There will be a need to comply with procurement rules and avoid conflicts of interest. The Minister mentioned guidelines that will outline the circumstances in which NDFA advice must be sought. That is important because there could be conflict.</P>
    <P>Funding under the NDFA will be backed with a Government guarantee and, therefore, it should be possible for it to borrow at better rates than the private sector. There will also be less need for direct State funding for projects. When the Taoiseach spoke in Ennis prior to the election, he referred to the agency as the likely conduit for the Ennis by-pass, the Gort to Crusheen project and a number of others along the western corridor.</P>
    <P>There are those who would say the idea was plucked out of the hat following the general election when everyone was aware the finances required for some of these projects might not be available. A snippet of the Taoiseach's speech was played on a local radio programme a week ago when an attempt was made to infer that he said the Ennis bypass would proceed immediately. Unfortunately, what he said was that it would be considered in the context of the funding provided under this agency. That happened approximately ten days prior to the general election, therefore it gave me an opportunity to remind those who said the news of financial difficulties was entirely new to them that they were wrong.</P>
    <P>As I said, the funding will be backed by Government guarantee. For that reason it will have advantages in terms of interest costs and the amount available to the agency. It has implications for the general Government balance, a new measure of finance which will come into play in regard to our obligations under the stability and growth pact. Given EUROSTAT rulings, no doubt it will impact on our standing under that particular ruling. Those who said the commitments under the new agency will be off the balance of the books are wrong. The Minister said in his speech that the funding will be under the figures considered by EUROSTAT and it will come into play in regard to our obligations under the stability and growth pact.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to rigorous corporate governance requirements. This is a very important area because, bearing in mind the size of the projects, the costs involved and the fact that a national agency will be dealing with complicated financing arrangements and looking at various options, it will be of the utmost import<Col N="425" />ance that any conflict of interest which might arise will be open, visible and transparent. There should not be disclosure of confidential information which would be a considerable worry to those involved.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for special purpose companies to raise finance. This can be done directly by the agency or at its behest. These special companies must have the Minister's approval but they do not have a Government guarantee which extends to other finances provided under the agency. Presumably in those instances some of the funding at least will come from tolls. Many of us must be thinking it is a great pity much more work was not done long ago under this system because the kind of infrastructure we now lament the loss of would be long since in place, probably paid for and available to benefit the national economy and the comfort of citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to thank the last speaker because it is the first time in a long time I have heard some sense coming from the Fianna Fáil benches, particularly in regard to the transport issue. I could not agree with him more when he speaks about the motorway proposals that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats introduced, which will suck life into Dublin. The national planning strategy will mean nothing if there are no motorways leading to the centre. I could not agree with him more that the Ennis bypass will be at the top of the Green Party's road building programme, ahead of the nonsensical over-bloated motorway schemes. I request he goes to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, who is of the view that no one in the House other than the Green Party holds these views. My colleagues in Fine Gael and Labour seem to believe one can provide motorways throughout the country while at the same time talking about the possibility of promoting public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not here to talk about public transport, even though I would like to, because I want to address a number of points in the Bill. One thing struck me during Taoiseach's Question Time &ndash; I do not know if the Department of Finance officials were aware of it. When discussing the PPP process, the Taoiseach uttered a very strong line in favour of the Green Party to the effect that it espoused the same opinions and views of the Department of Finance. That was a very interesting and welcome development. I hope I can now speak on behalf of my colleagues in the Department of Finance in raising some critical analysis under the National Development Finance Agency Bill so that we do not rush into a financing system for infrastructural development which will cost more in the long-term than the <Col N="426" />political ideologues on the right would lead us to believe.</P>
    <P>I do not have a problem <i>per se</i> with setting up the agency or with the use of public private partnerships. I have a problem, however, when they are applied in the wrong context and when the risk factors are not analysed correctly. I will highlight a series of problems with the PPP process and the flaws we may be about to witness. We must look at the private sector in assessing projects. If one looks at a number of recent major private sector investments, including the Telecom sector, they proved spectacularly bad at putting a correct value in terms of investment in assets. I do not think we should necessarily believe that private is always better than public when it comes to making investment decisions on major infrastructural assets. Private sector thinking lacks a critical part of the thinking of the public sector, that is, a long-term analysis. I would argue that the private sector tends to be constrained to fairly short-term timeframes.</P>
    <P>People give out about politicians who just look towards the next election, but under the Stock Exchange rules, large corporations look to each quarter rather than on a long-term basis. One example of where long-term planning is needed and where I do not think private interests would give the correct analysis is in the energy market. We must make a major investment in our ESB transmission network and power stations over a number of years. The decisions made now will have an effect in 40 years' time. Normally the life cycle of these plants would be ended over 30 years and depreciated over 20 years, but in reality they will probably be with us in 40 years' time. Therefore, the investment decisions we make now in regard to the energy market, for example, will have an effect in 40 years' time. When I go to the electricity grid people and ask do they think we should be investing in transmission connections to the renewable network, which on a long-term basis in 40 years' time is where the country will have a competitive advantage, make money and be leading the way, they say no because the Government's view is that we must follow short-term market considerations and unless there is an immediate market for the product they cannot make that investment. One of my big fears about the public private partnership system is that it is short-term and State investment needs to be long-term.</P>
    <P>Another example is Dublin Airport. People are now saying that in 20 or 30 years' time 30 million passengers will be passing through the airport. Has there been an analysis of the amount of oil that will be left in 30 years' time? Has anyone thought how these people will fly? We may be driving our cars on hydrogen fuel, but in 30 years' time jet fuel, which one will need to get these big planes off the ground, will not be available, or if it is, it will cost a huge amount of money. Michael Ryan will not be flying to Stuttgart or wherever for a &euro;1 hop, it will be a real luxury. I would argue that the private sector cannot provide that sort of <Col N="427" />analysis on a long-term basis, therefore we need the public sector for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It is very important in any PPP process or in the way this agency will work that there is a separation of the design of infrastructure and funding. Where funding dictates, design mistakes will be made. We need to put the right infrastructure in place. If financiers are saying we need this type of structure it will not be on the basis of the correct design or need on a long-term basis, it will more than likely be based on a short-term cost analysis of the greatest return. A simple example is choosing a metro route.</P>
    <P>The private financial sector will say we should go through the docklands where there is an immediate demand and it will pay back in ten or 15 years. A transport planner would say this is a project which will be with us for 100 years, we should go through Finglas and the lands zoned in that area which could be developed in the long-term to bring about proper planning of the city. It is vital that design analysis is separate from funding analysis. If we design our infrastructure on the basis of what bankers and financiers tell us, it will be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Size matters, as another Deputy has said. One of the problems with public private partnerships is that they concentrate on big developers, from Ireland and internationally, who are seen as able to deliver the type of projects involved. There is no competition when there is a small number of large development companies, such as Treasury Holdings, National Toll Roads and others. Companies of that size are the only ones with the status and leverage to take on the contracts in question. The PPP process must be changed to favour small indigenous companies in order to let them grow. That has been a failing to date.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the increasing incidence of people leaving the public sector and immediately going to work in the private sector for contractors bidding for public projects. This Bill should include a clause, which the Green Party will put forward on Committee Stage, to have a time gap before a public sector worker could work for such a private contractor. There is an unhealthy trend where people are gaining valuable experience about how the public sector works and then using that knowledge for private sector gain. There is a need for amendment to the Bill on conditions of employment to allow for a short time gap where people cannot move from the public to the private sector.</P>
    <P>One of the most damning arguments against PPPs is that they are expensive. The State is purchasing at a much higher interest rate than it would borrow at. There is also the cost of the 15% profit that any private sector investor will look to make from any project. Not only is the State paying a higher rate but it is paying a profit also. This is not a good investment and, in many cases, PPP is not the right way to go. I am concerned that, in new infrastructure areas, the State does not have the technical expertise to carry out <Col N="428" />a proper risk analysis when it comes to setting aside costs. Much work needs to be done and the key to PPPs is how risk is tied in.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the role of the Minister for Finance with regard to the formulation of development policy on PPPs will remain unchanged. What then is the purpose of this Bill? Why is this agency being set up if the Department of Finance still holds the purse strings? It is strange that the agency is to be set up and given powers but the current structures will still apply. I would prefer more balance and a situation where everything is not given over to the private sector or to this independent agency.</P>
    <P>The history of the early years of the State and the Department of Finance shows, in many ways, a shamefully conservative position. There was little investment or borrowing for the development of the country and that is being paid for now. A similarly conservative approach should be avoided at this time as should the belief that the private sector is the only one which can progress development. A return must be made to the possibilities of public enterprise which the founding parties of the State embodied but have lost. There should be trust in our ability to develop our assets and country. I do not agree with the Government parties that it is only private profit makers who can make the right decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was greatly interested to read that the purpose of the National Development Finance Agency was to establish an agency that would assist in providing cost-effective finance for priority infrastructure projects. I am interested in anything that will allow infrastructure projects to proceed. That has been the problem in the west in that it has lacked basic infrastructure that was and still is needed to make it a competitive area. Because of that, the west is losing its youth and half of its graduates must go to Dublin to get their first job.</P>
      <P>The agency should work nationally because we need to redress the situation where the national development plan has done the west no favours, even though it is supposed to be a national plan. A policy of balanced regional development supposedly exists for all the State, but does not. This Bill should redress the situation where national roads expenditure in the BMW region is 29% behind target while in the south and east region it is 45% over target. It would be something if this Bill could redress that, and provide broadband, railways and other necessary infrastructure such as a proper road to Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I get despondent when I read that the Bill will provide finance for priority infrastructure projects because I know what that means. The west was never a priority and will not be. I would be happier with the Bill if it helped to provide proper roads throughout Ireland instead of motorways to Dublin and other places. It does nothing for second and third class roads. The Bill should include provision to prioritise areas which lack basic infrastructure, such as Mayo, so that every <Col N="429" />area in the State would have, not a motorway, but a proper road which would for the first time give some semblance of equality across the State. This would put an end to the comedy of the roads into Mayo, which is not really a comedy but a laugh on the people of Mayo. It is a tragedy for them, not a comedy.</P>
    <P>A century ago, my village had a twice daily train service but it is now lucky to see a bus once a day. A day does not pass without damage to cars on the N5. The NRA continually neglects the N5 but it is the Government which is against balanced regional development. The multinational Allergen factory, which provides very good jobs in Westport, has to repackage its goods after their journey on the N5 to Dublin because of the condition of the road. The situation is scandalous and it is time it changed. In one recent episode, 13 angry motorists damaged their vehicles in craters on the N5. This Bill should not concern itself with motorways but should prioritise decent roads for every part of the State.</P>
    <P>The national development plan is at its halfway stage. The delay in the national spatial strategy has been problematic, although that is a gross understatement. The plan was the equivalent, in rural terms, of putting the cart before the horse. How could the NDP work without the national spatial strategy?</P>
    <P>What will this Bill do for Mayo and the west? Will it provide the necessary schools and roads which have been denied by generations of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael representation? If promises were infrastructure, the west would be a competitive area and would be able to hold on to its youth because it would have a future. However, promises are not infrastructure and the west has only bad roads, rail and telecommunications, with no mobile phone reception or ISDN in some parts. The people of the west have no future. Professor Seamus Caulfield analysed census figures and said that the west was the only region in Ireland in dire straits due to the terrible ongoing depopulation. This Bill is not the answer to that problem. The west did not get the necessary funding before and will not get it now.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a cop-out. Its main purpose is to provide an alternative to mainstream up-front Exchequer funding. However, the kernel of the problem is that the west has not got this funding. How is this Bill to provide it? Perhaps, it is a way of giving people in the west the money they need and which would not be possible without the Bill. The money the agency raises counts as Government borrowing but not Exchequer borrowing, and this might mean that money borrowed in this way has EU approval as a form of borrowing within single currency membership rules. However, this is not certain and depends on the view taken by EUROSTAT. It may be that raising money through toll roads on motorways, which will give income return to private investors, means that it will again serve the unbalanced regional development agenda and the motorways of the east. Under the NDP, this has already cop<Col N="430" />per-fastened the development of the south and east to the detriment of the BMW region, and north and west Mayo in particular.</P>
    <P>Why should the people of the west have to jump through hoops, with Europe and others, to attract funding to their area from central Government? Everywhere is equal but some areas are more equal than others. The west matters but it has been ripped off; the money that came from Europe was made on the backs of the people of the west, and they retained Objective One status after a hard fight. That status enables us to obtain higher grants, but what good are these when we cannot get the money in the first instance?</P>
    <P>Making profit is the objective of the private sector. Let us consider the example of the provision of gas. The only way gas will be made available in Mayo is through a public service obligation. The Government has already said as much, but has not even taken the first step to ensuring that this happens by seeking EU permission to provide gas. The new body will be a new quango, like Bord Gáis, and will only operate where it can return a profit. There will be a pipeline in Mayo, but it will take the gas away and not distribute it throughout the county. Studies show it is not commercially viable to provide gas in any town in Mayo. Putting this on the agenda of the PPP is condemning us to the neglect with which we have become familiar. Even if the private sector was to become involved, it will have to obtain a return. This means that poor people could not avail of these services, to which, as citizens, they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a failure to provide balanced regional development. The country should not be taken for a ride by the private sector. I question the need for this new structure, particularly in view of the fact that many structures are already in place. We have been let down by the NDP and the health strategy is in tatters &ndash; we do not need more bureaucracy. Why should we sell our souls to the private sector? What will it cost us? We are very good Europeans and we did very well by the Nice treaty. Perhaps, therefore, we should enter discussions with the Commission. How will this agency conduct its business when the NDP is failing so horribly, particularly in the west? Is not the Bill a smokescreen to give the impression that the Government is doing something when it has squandered our wealth and forgotten about the west?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was recently quoted as saying that the private sector should have a role in providing broadband services. He made this statement after the decision was taken to substantially reduce expenditure on the roll-out of broadband infrastructure. The western investment fund was cut by 68%, CLÁR funding was cut by 25% and there were further cuts in REPS and other farm schemes. The new body bodes badly for our third class roads and crumbling schools. As with broadband and other essential needs, Mayo will have to wait until every other part of the country is serviced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" />It has been stated that the NDFA will be staffed by experts in company finance and will have the ability to deliver large building projects. It will also advise the Government on how to borrow at the lowest rates. Why do I have a sinking feeling about this? Why do I feel the Bill is about serving political parties, big business and urban areas? It will do nothing to improve the Third World roads or the other infrastructural deficits in Mayo. CIE is considering closing the fine freight yard in Ballina. What about the Ballina-Manulla train line and the Claremorris-Limerick lines? We deserve better, but this plan will not give it to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a number of contributions to the debate and noticed that people's perception of what the agency is going to do varies considerably. One Deputy referred to it as another level of bureaucracy and a quango. If I was to believe what he said, I would have no faith in the Bill. However, I do not believe him.</P>
      <P>People have legitimately used this debate to discuss infrastructure, which is the biggest issue we are likely to face in the coming years. Ireland entered the 1990s with high unemployment and finished the decade low employment. The consequences of that are significant. People's lifestyles changed and the population and the level of car ownership increased. One can see the consequences of this every day. I left Clondalkin at 9 a.m. this morning and it took me two hours and ten minutes to travel the seven miles to Leinster House. I have tried a variety of routes but to no avail. It is frustrating to see someone walking by when one is stuck in traffic, because one knows one will not overtake that person while travelling at less than 3 mph. Such has been the extent of growth in this country that current traffic levels on the West Link toll bridge have already equalled those predicted for 2016.</P>
      <P>If we are to tackle infrastructural deficit in an efficient manner, it is important we consider how to finance it. I understand the National Development Finance Agency Bill, 2002, deals with that. Some Members have said the agency will determine the detail of the projects, but that is not my understanding. It will look at the best and most efficient means of raising the funding. There is a huge range of infrastructural deficits &ndash; I refer here to those relating to national roads, Luas, the introduction of a metro, airports, the upgrade of rail transport, etc. &ndash; in respect of which major funding will be required. Clondalkin would greatly benefit from the upgrade of the Kildare route project because virtually the only means of travel between Clondalkin-Lucan and the city is by road. The Kildare route project would lead to the lines being upgraded from two to four tracks and a commuter service could be provided as a result. It is for such projects the agency will provide efficient financing. It will also secure finance for hospitals and schools, particularly primary schools, in our expanding suburbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" />I first became aware of the agency through reference to it in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. I am glad the Bill to establish is now being introduced. The agency is necessary because of the amount of money that is to be spent on our infrastructure. The Bill needs to focus on the most cost-effective and efficient means of raising those funds. Some Members seem to think the sole focus of the agency would be public private partnerships. Such schemes have a role to play and there is a place for them, but they will only account for a certain percentage of the funding that is to be raised.</P>
    <P>It makes sense to bring together the expertise to manage the funding of these projects. The impression has been given that the agency will design the projects, but, according to my reading of the Bill, I believe it is envisaged that Departments will present the finance agency with their projects to determine how best to progress them. The latter may well be achieved by borrowing or through public private partnerships. In any event, the purpose of the agency is to provide the financing in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum says that &ldquo;State authorities will be required to seek expert advice from the NDFA on commercial and financial issues associated with public investment projects&rdquo;. These bodies often produce fine plans, but have great difficulty in raising the finance, or, where they do raise it, they may not do so in the most efficient way.</P>
    <P>The NDFA can only raise limited funds and, therefore, it will either raise loans or establish public private partnerships. In light of the amounts of money involved, I expect it to borrow at favourable rates. However, there is no such thing as free money. Some Members referred to the NDFA as being able to magically provide money without cost, but there is always a cost. There is also a cost to public private partnerships &ndash; they do not come free of charge. The advantage of establishing this agency will be that it will allow a quantifiable measurement of value for money.</P>
    <P>A number of Members stated that public private partnerships are undesirable, but they have no means on which to base this assertion. Public private partnerships do not only apply to major projects. I understand that a school in Tobercurry has been built on a public private partnership basis. I am told &ndash; I have not seen it &ndash; it is an excellent development. Public private partnerships look at more than the greenfield site and the structure of the building. They examine what other costs, such as maintenance, will be associated with it.</P>
    <P>I read in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> that there will be a new funding system for the Luas extension in Cherrywood in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area. It will cost approximately &euro;260 million. No one knows if that is the most expedient and efficient way to develop the project. The establishment of this agency will <Col N="433" />seek to ensure that public private partnerships deliver value for money. The Opposition is right in that if we do not get value for money from public private partnerships, we should borrow money. The agency will afford us the opportunity to clearly determine if we are getting value for money. Public private partnerships are a necessity.</P>
    <P>At the outset I listed the infrastructural deficits in my area, which are significant. If we want to provide proper facilities in a reasonable time period, we must get private funding. In the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, private developers were prepared to make a contribution towards the provision of Luas if development land was made available because they could see the benefits. We must work more closely together as we move forward. I am not saying we should have public private partnerships at any cost. However, they should be encouraged where they are proven to make sound economic sense. If we do not take that route and introduce additional funding, the existing infrastructural deficit will be prolonged.</P>
    <P>The viability and competitiveness of our economy and the welfare and quality of life of the people depend on the delivery of facilities and services in a more reasonable time period. The national development finance agency will help to move some of these projects forward. Some may happen through conventional means of borrowing, but public private partnerships are an important part of our development. I heard Deputies asking who would provide a road or a gas pipeline in a certain area. I agree that some areas will not suit public private partnerships. However, some projects, which are economically sound, will suit them. They will bring additional funds into the economy to deliver such projects. If additional resources are not made available, the time period will be too long.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill. I look forward to the establishment and operation of the national development finance agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The delivery of the national development plan is a shambles. That was seen last Thursday week when as the capital city ground to a halt, the Minister for Transport sat snugly in his Department and announced the Estimates which meant there would be no new roads projects in 2003 and that many vital infrastructural projects would be shelved. Deputy Curran highlighted it again in the House. It takes him as long to travel from Clondalkin to the city centre as it takes for the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, or me to travel here from our constituencies. It is totally unacceptable. The city and the country are grinding to a halt because we are not investing in infrastructural projects. The five inter-urban routes under the NDP have been delayed by at least three years and will not open until at least 2009.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital spending has been savaged in the 2003 budget Estimates. Infrastructural spending has <Col N="434" />been reduced by at least &euro;400 million or 6% compared to the 2002 allocation. The Taoiseach tried to defend these cuts by saying we must be realistic about what we can afford in light of the downturn in the international economy. However, what he and other Ministers fail to acknowledge is that our economy is growing by at least 3.3%.</P>
    <P>As regards public transport, which I am sure is close to Deputy Curran's heart, Luas is again running behind schedule. It will not be operational until at least 2005. In a parliamentary reply I received yesterday the Minister for Transport said that the construction of Luas will not be completed until 2004. He said that passenger services will not commence until commissioning and safety checks have been done. It will be at least 2005 before Luas serves the people of Dublin city and its suburbs. The investment programme is being dragged out. The Railway Procurement Agency, which will oversee the Luas construction, has a borrowing requirement for 2003 of at least &euro;90 million. That body also has responsibility for developing the Dublin metro. That proposal is also lying idle and gathering dust. This project needs to be expedited.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently sanctioned a 9% fare increase for CIE. The subvention to CIE will be approximately &euro;500 million in a full year or &euro;10 million per week. What improvement will we see for that investment? The Minister has promised that users of public transport will see a difference in service capacity and frequency in 2003 when the major infrastructural projects, which began in 2000 and 2001, are completed. We all know that will not be the case because the additional capacity has not been provided for the public transport system or for our roads infrastructure. Deputy Curran will still spend more than two hours travelling into the city &ndash; it will probably be closer to three hours this time next year. That is the situation with which we are dealing on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>As regards roads projects, more than 20 major national roads projects, which were promised under the national development plan and cleared by An Bord Pleanála, will be delayed by several years because of the funding shortfall. Not one additional new kilometre of road will be constructed under a new project in 2003. Those projects include the Monasterevin bypass, the Sligo inner relief road, the Ennis bypass, which was mentioned earlier by Deputy Killeen, and others which cost more than &euro;1 billion and which aim to improve road safety and eradicate major bottlenecks throughout the country. The Minister has repeated that the road construction programme under the national development plan will not meet its 2006 target. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport accepted only in recent weeks that we will not meet the target set out under the national development plan. The Minister said it will take an extra couple of years. It will be at least three years before the major roads projects are put in place and it will be longer <Col N="435" />before other projects, such as bypasses and inner relief roads, are completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said that both health and infrastructural spending were now considerably above the European average, which we have lagged behind for decades. It is above the European average, but the Minister has failed to recognise that our infrastructure is, as the Tánaiste said, equivalent to Third World standards. We must dramatically increase the level of funding we provide for infrastructural projects to catch up with the level of investment in the European Union. Meeting or being slightly above the European average will not help to improve the congestion and bottlenecks.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Transport stated that the NDP projects will depend on funding and that a review of the NDP will take place next year. There is not much point talking about reviewing the NDP next year when we know the cost overruns have been dramatic. The Minister is living in cloud-cuckooland. The investment in national road improvements for 2000 to 2002 is approximately &euro;2.62 billion. That is in excess of 12% compared to what is provided under the national development plan. That leaves a significant shortfall because the cost of the NDP is running in excess of 66% of that projected at the time of its publication.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance is looking at multiannual budgeting, but there is not much point in looking at that when we do not know the cost of road projects to date. Deputy Killeen blamed the significant increase in costs on construction inflation when he spoke earlier, but failed to recognise that one of the other causes is the fact that the projects were incorrectly costed initially. A higher specification is required in the case of the Dublin Port tunnel than was originally planned under the NDP and even when that was taken into account the National Roads Authority forgot to account for extractor fans costing more than &euro;150 million to take fumes out of the tunnel. Many projects were originally conceived of as dual carriageways built over the existing road network, but when they were upgraded to greenfield motorways, the projected costs were not increased correspondingly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eamon Ryan spoke earlier about motorways and the House is aware of the Green Party's position in relation to these projects. The party wants to develop existing roads and there is a debate ongoing regarding that, but some of the arguments being put forward must be dispelled. I have first-hand knowledge of the projects that are going ahead since the new M6 to Galway is being built over my family's farm and passes within 500 metres of my own door. The Green Party wants to upgrade the existing road between Athlone and Ballinasloe by widening it from a single carriageway to a dual carriageway. If the NRA went ahead with that proposal there would be slaughter every day of the week on that road because it would still not be able to accommodate the vol<Col N="436" />ume of traffic using it. The only way to address the carnage on one of the most dangerous sections of road outside the Louth-Meath Garda division is to build a new motorway between Athlone and Ballinasloe and continue it to Galway. Every community along the N6 would tell you the same story and I am sure the same is true right around the country. While the Green Party questions investment in these motorways, it fails to talk to the communities along these roads on which lives are put at risk every day. That issue cannot be ignored when we speak about motorways because that form of road is extremely safe compared to single carriageways.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport has not been able to fund these projects because his Department is working off the 1999 figures despite the fact that the Taoiseach told me last month that if I put down a question to the Minister, I would be given the revised figures. They have not been furnished to me because the Minister for Transport does not have them which makes me question how the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure can assess what investment needs to be made in road projects. It cannot give advice in relation to that because we do not have accurate figures. The commitment the Taoiseach gave on the floor of the House has been ignored by the Department of Transport. The Minister insisted that when the Estimates were published they would indicate that funding had gone up by 2% on this year's budget. However, if we take into account the extra &euro;80 million allocated after last year's Estimates, there is actually a 2.2% cut. If ordinary inflation as opposed to construction inflation is included, the real cut is of the order of 6.7%. Given that construction inflation is not accounted for, there is a dramatic fall off in the level of investment in roads projects in 2003.</P>
    <P>Last week, Deputy Richard Bruton said that the delivery of road and other projects under the NDP is sloppy in relation to monitoring of costs, monitoring of physical outputs and control of overruns. Slippage has become the order of the day in the NDP, but the problem continues to be ignored. No matter how much legislation we bring in, unless we keep a tight rein on that slippage we will have significant problems delivering even a revised plan. The Bill before the House will help to relieve problems in the areas Deputy Curran mentioned and I hope it will address the congestion in the Dublin area. However, it perpetuates regional apartheid because it ignores the need to develop infrastructure in the regions. The sole purpose of the NDFA is to provide funding under the national development plan through public private partnerships, which is the core principle of this legislation. It will have a detrimental impact on regional development because the projects which will be financially viable for the private sector will be large undertakings in the main urban centres including hospitals, schools and sewerage schemes, or systems involving large numbers of people such as a Dublin metro. The only projects that will benefit the <Col N="437" />regions will be the interurban routes, but the Minister for Transport has admitted his intention to toll such roads without looking at alternative funding mechanisms. The introduction of tolling will be an additional tax on employment and industry in the regions and jobs will be put at risk.</P>
    <P>The only action taken by this Government and the Minister for Transport in relation to regional infrastructure has been to close the Sligo-Limerick line by physically taking up the track and to wind down rail freight services which will mean the closure of further lines. If the savings made possible by private sector funding were reinvested in other projects in the regions where private investment is not viable, it would be welcome. However, those savings are being used by the Minister for Finance to subvent his budget as a result of massive cost overruns. County Mayo is serviced by the N5, mentioned by Deputy Cowley, which is a glorified cart track that is supposed to be a national primary route, and by a clapped out train that has been downgraded by Irish Rail in the last couple of months. Prior to the general election, Deputy Cowley asked the people to elect an Independent saying he would deliver the N5, a proper rail service and investment in County Mayo. The N5 was to be upgraded by 2019, but that has been put back to 2025, which is how Deputy Cowley has delivered. He can come in here as often as he likes to blame political parties for the lack of investment, but it is time for us all to concentrate on the need to invest in the regions no matter what side of the Chamber we are on.</P>
    <P>The only proposal the NRA is making is to close the N5 and amalgamate it with the N4, which is a fine example of the delivery of a project by the Government. It is a contradiction of what a Government Member said prior to the last general election. We can talk all we like about the NDP, PPPs, the WDC, the BMW region and the NDFA, but if there is no commitment from Government to invest, the regions will be ignored which is what is happening with the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has not been prepared to invest in the regions. On three separate occasions I asked the Taoiseach to ensure that the Minister for Finance or a representative on the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure would meet with the board of the national pensions reserve fund to discuss putting some of that investment into our roads infrastructure. In his usual style, the Taoiseach talked around the issue, but it has been evident that he has not looked at ways to invest some of that fund in roads projects. He and the Minister for Finance are quite happy to see &euro;1 billion from the pensions fund channelled into foreign stock markets to support foreign employment in foreign industries. We are not prepared to invest that money in our own infrastructure and to commit to a return on it.</P>
    <P>The only solution the Minister for Transport can see to the huge deficit in funding under the <Col N="438" />national development plan is to introduce tolling. He is not prepared to look at any other element that could fund those projects such as providing exclusive service rights on some of the motorways, shadow tolling and other mechanisms.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan said we have to be extremely careful that the privatisation of roads will not end up costing the Exchequer more in the long run and that it will be a mechanism used by Government to take liability away from the Department of Finance so that it can be covered up so far as the European Union is concerned. The projects must be seen as value for money and must be delivered on efficiently and effectively if they are to succeed. I am sure there are projects that can fit into that category but there is also a responsibility on the National Development Finance Agency to ensure Ministers take a responsible attitude on how they seek funding. Under the provisions of section 8 the Minister will refer a project to the National Development Finance Agency and seek the expert advice of that agency on how to fund that project. Eventually responsibility for the decisions on the individual projects comes down to the Minister or the State authority involved. The Minister or the State authority, such as the unaccountable National Roads Authority, do not have to take the advice of the National Development Finance Agency. There must be some element of accountability. The experts in this areas will provide the advice on how to plan and fund the project, yet the Minister, or the State agency, can ignore that recommendation, as in the case of the National Roads Authority which does not have to take the advice provided.</P>
    <P>I hope a mechanism for accountability will be provided in the legislation. I ask the Minister to look at section 18 with a view to ensuring an element of accountability so that we can question him on the floor of the House on the working of the new agency. It is crucially important that such organisations and agencies are accountable to this House. The Minister has only to ask any member of his party or any Member about the National Roads Authority. It is an unaccountable organisation which has massive budgets and spends massive amounts throughout the country and has a huge impact on regional development and what areas will be developed. There is no point in speaking about a spatial strategy without the NRA being tied into it, yet the NRA is unaccountable to the House on how it spends that money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has its origins in the general election campaign. The Minister for Finance will remember distinctly the second day of the general election campaign when, with all the razzmatazz he could muster, he unveiled his big idea, that of the National Development Finance Agency, to the assembled media. That big economic idea was nothing more than a big economy with the truth. The first mention of this idea came in the Minister's speech at the Fianna Fáil <Col N="439" />Ard Fheis in February when he told the people they could have everything they wanted, spending, tax cuts, there would be no need for borrowing and he would work magic with the country's finances. We can all see now how that promise is being fulfilled.</P>
      <P>The Minister's promises did not add up at that time and the solution produced is the National Development Finance Agency. It is a truly magic solution. It will enable the Government to borrow without calling it Government borrowing. It will enable money to be conjured up from nowhere so far as the public finances are concerned. Apparently this is to be achieved in two ways &ndash; to borrow &euro;1 billion per year which would count against the general Government balance but would not be Exchequer borrowing and to produce funding of a further &euro;1 billion per year which would fund capital projects without affecting the Exchequer balance or the general Government balance.</P>
      <P>Hard though it is to believe, Ministers of the Government at the last general election told the public that because this new agency would borrow money it would not be Exchequer borrowing. If the NTMA borrows money that is Exchequer borrowing but if the new agency within the NTMA borrows money that is not Exchequer borrowing. Former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, had an expression for that type of thing which involved the use of some unparliamentary language but the manure here is just as pure.</P>
      <P>The reality is that this whole idea comes down to public private partnerships and their advancement. The failure by the last Government to deliver on PPPs is the main motivation for the Bill. When the Government published the national development plan in 1999, it promised PPPs would provide a large share of the funding for the projects contained in the plan. That expectation has not been realised. The purpose of the National Development Finance Agency is to drive forward the PPP agenda. We have to judge it on that basis and so far the evidence is not reassuring. Evidence, particularly from the United Kingdom, shows the fears expressed at the outset of PPPs are starting to be realised.</P>
      <P>This Bill is effectively about a new form of privatisation of the country's infrastructure. It is the instrument which the Government intends to use to drive forward a privatisation agenda except that the &ldquo;P&rdquo; word is not used. The Bill will put the privatisation of public assets and infrastructure into an entirely new league. Privatisation is no longer a case of the sale of a State agency or some of its assets, it is to be extended to large sections of our public infrastructure: roads, water and sewerage services, schools, hospitals, colleges, universities, ports and harbours. Even many of the courthouses in which the system of justice is administered will, effectively, be operated on a private basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation has profound implications for the ownership and management of our public <Col N="440" />infrastructure into the future. It will change fundamentally the way in which decisions are made on infrastructure projects from schools to sewage treatment plants and set up a two-tier system for the approval of such projects. The idea is that there will be an agency, under the NTMA, which will advise on the sourcing of funding, PPPs, management and borrowing. In effect it will be a one stop shop for public private partnerships.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look at what this legislation is intended to cover. In the press briefing given by the Minister at the time of the publication of this Bill, a list of projects was circulated. It identified the kinds of projects that might be considered. They include schools, housing projects, car parks, park and ride facilities, town hall and town centre, car testing, light rail, Luas, motorways, national roads, waste infrastructure projects, water supply schemes, sewage treatment works, group water schemes and so on. One of the striking things about the list is the use of the three letters DBO to describe the type of project in each case &ndash; design, build and operate is now the new code for what will be privatised facilities in the future.</P>
    <P>This is privatisation with a velvet glove. Design, build and operate, no matter how it is construed, means in effect that the facilities which are to be provided under this system will be operated privately in the future, with all of the implications that has in relation to staffing, the interrelationships between the facility being provided and the local, public or State authority to which it relates.</P>
    <P>If such facilities are operated privately, there must be a return. It is therefore logical to assume that roads which are provided under the system will be tolled. The public, who have up to now viewed roads as a public amenity and part of the public space, will from now on be expected to pay by way of tolling for roads provided under this arrangement. Similarly, water treatment facilities, water supply schemes and sewage treatment facilities provided under this arrangement will, in the course of time, have to be paid for as well. This is also teeing up for the reintroduction through the back door of charges of some kind for water or for the provision of sewage treatment facilities as is currently the case with the charging, through local authorities and private operators, for the delivery of waste services.</P>
    <P>School buildings will come within the ambit of this arrangement. Buildings which have traditionally been provided through public funding and which have been part of the public facilities available within communities will, from now on, essentially be private buildings and will be built and managed by a private company. The schools which operate from them will effectively have some kind of a lease arrangement or have the status of tenants within the buildings, and when they are finished at 3.30 p.m. or 4 p.m. it will be open to the operators of the building to use it for whatever commercial use they want. What we are seeing is a very significant shift in the public infrastructure. Public facilities that have always been <Col N="441" />provided through the public authorities and have been available in general as public facilities are to become private facilities.</P>
    <P>A second problem arises. It has to do with the selection of projects, with the ordering of priorities by Government for funding and the building and provision of that infrastructure. We know from experience that in the case of schools, for example, the Department of Education and Science has its own list of school building projects that it will advance. Inevitably, there is a degree of jockeying for priority on that list. Notwithstanding that, decisions on which schools get approval are very often made on the basis of political choice. All of those projects, however, have the same starting point so that, at least in theory, there is some notion that decisions are based on the merits of the case. This arrangement will set up a two-tier system for such decisions. On one hand, there will be projects which come within the PPP system which will be on a fast track and, on the other there will be other projects which do not come within the PPP system which will be in some kind of second division.</P>
    <P>The question is who gets into the premier league. The premier league for these projects will be in areas where private interest can see the possibility of a return or some advantage in progressing the project. Inevitably, therefore, whether it is a school building or road scheme, or a water and sewage treatment scheme, the choice of that scheme in terms of qualification for PPP will very often be based on the ability of the community to pay and the degree to which the private interest considers it has an economic worth.</P>
    <P>I have seen some of this already. A school in my constituency has already seen the potential of PPPs, and I congratulate it on its initiative. However, not every school will be in the same situation. Schools which serve disadvantaged areas are hardly likely to be first on the list of a company looking at a potential PPP. What will happen, therefore, in relation to school building projects is that schools located in affluent areas, serving an affluent clientele will become the candidates for PPPs, the DBO type of operation, and will get on to the fast track for their building project and, just as we have in the health service, just as we have in many other areas of life, we will have a second division where everybody else goes. The same will happen in the provision of water and sewage treatment. Where it is perceived that the provision of water and sewage treatment services is in an area where the development potential is high, there will be interest from companies in a PPP and such schemes will be moved rapidly through the PPP process and be progressed ahead of others.</P>
    <P>The same will happen with regard to public transport. A previous speaker referred to a proposal which affects my constituency, the extension of the Luas to Cherrywood, Cabinteely, with which I agree. However, the reality is that the selection of the kind of scheme that will be facilitated by this agency will be based on the potential <Col N="442" />return to the investor. Again, the more affluent, the better off, the more advantaged an area or community is, the greater is the likelihood that its infrastructural project will be progressed, whether it is a road scheme, provision of services, public transport, school or any of the other public projects which are envisaged or anticipated by this arrangement.</P>
    <P>There are two things I wish to say about the Bill in support of Deputy Burton's opposition to it. This legislation is a polite, sophisticated means of progressing a privatisation agenda with regard to public infrastructure. Through this legislation we can see the groundwork for a two-tier system for decision-making on public projects and on the country's priorities in terms of the provision of infrastructure. I refer here to school buildings, roads, public transport or any of the other facilities that come under the general infrastructure umbrella.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies McGrath and Healy.</P>
      <P>In the past, perhaps when it was the Department of Local Government, the Department of the Environment had responsibility for all roads in the country. In a fit of political correctness the Government of the day decided to give responsibility for national roads to the National Roads Authority. Since then, there has been universal criticism of the National Roads Authority by politicians. The NRA is a great shield for the Government. It can blame the NRA when particular road projects are not progressing, while conveniently ignoring the fact that it is that body's financier. If the Government does not provide the authority with sufficient funds, the projects cannot proceed.</P>
      <P>I have heard many experienced politicians, including some from the Minister's party, say that we should never again bestow such authority on a body whose remit is to carry out public projects. The lesson seems to be that where there is a public related function, there should be public accountability.</P>
      <P>There is a massive infrastructural deficit in the country. The deficit is so enormous &ndash; and has been for many years &ndash; that one would have to ask if the current system is capable of producing the goods. The vibes emanating from the Estimates suggest that we will be obliged to wade through the infrastructural deficit for some years to come.</P>
      <P>How will the national development finance agency operate? Will it have any relevance for the major part of the country? Will it have anything to offer with regard to finance for water and sewerage schemes or finance for our inadequate rail system? Will its efforts be solely related to acquiring funds for major road works? It is obvious that its only function may be to obtain money for major road works. Does that mean we can look forward to endless tolls on our new motorways? Those issues need to be teased out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" />When the NDFA comes into being, we will be told by the Minister for Finance, perhaps also by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others, that it is the body responsible for the financing of infrastructural projects. We will be informed that it is not appropriate for politicians to interfere with the workings of such a body. Rather than the Minister taking the responsibility for the lack of progress, there will then be two other bodies to blame &ndash; the NRA and the NDFA. Is this proposed agency a good idea or merely a device to circumvent existing constraints? Will it do its work in the same way as the National Treasury Management Agency or will it try and impose its will in a more dictatorial way?</P>
    <P>Will the NDFA have a regional remit or will it focus exclusively on getting funding for projects in the east at the expense of the rest of the country? Will the NDFA become the whipping boy for the Minister when projects contained in the national development plan do not proceed within the scheduled time?</P>
    <P>If the NDFA is being formed to circumvent the parameters of the stability pact, that is not a good enough reason to proceed. The way to proceed is to go back to our European partners with the clear message that our infrastructure is substandard. They must be informed that to progress as a nation we need immediate improvements. Borrowing to invest in good infrastructural projects should be outside the constraints imposed by the stability pact. That is the way forward. The way forward is not the establishment of another body which can be used to shield the Minister and the Government when the going gets tough and when our infrastructure remains deplorable, with nobody willing to accept responsibility for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath" hpid="Mr. F. McGrath Mr. F. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to discuss the National Development Finance Agency Bill, 2002. Before considering the nitty gritty details of the Bill, it is essential to recognise and acknowledge that when we discuss finances, the budget, the Estimates and this Bill, we are talking about and dealing with public money &ndash; taxpayers' money. It is essential that we use, protect and respect this money. Squandering public finances on useless projects does nothing for the country or for the needy in society. I make these points as a means of putting down a marker before discussing the detail of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the national development finance agency is to assist cost-effective finance for priority infrastructure projects as an alternative to up-front Exchequer funding or unsuitable private sector funding. I welcome the section which states that the State will be required to seek expert advice for the NDFA on commercial and financial issues associated with public investment projects. This is crucial to the debate on quality spending of public money. When we discuss expert advice, it should not be limited to civil servants or economic experts. We need to listen <Col N="444" />to the people and the community because they are sometimes well ahead of our so-called experts.</P>
    <P>Is anyone in a position to explain the social, humanitarian and economic madness of sending young people with disabilities out of the State, and miles from their homes and families, to obtain services? I refer here to three visually impaired pupils who are forced to leave the State for five days per week to avail of a service in Northern Ireland because such a service cannot be provided here. This is not acceptable, it is a disgraceful breach of human rights. From an economic point of view, it is a clear breach of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We need to consider the projects in the State that are value for money and designed for the people. Above all, we must put the needs of our people first. This is not happening at present. I hope the Bill tackles this issue head on. The theme and tone of this legislation is &ldquo;value for money&rdquo;. However, this could also be used to prevent and stifle worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>I have some concerns about section 4 which states that, in the provision of advice, the agency must take into account any policy directions issued by the Minister for Finance to State authorities regarding financing of public investment projects. I see the hand prints of the Department of Finance all over this section. Let us not allow economic whiz-kids dominate this Bill. If we spend &euro;1 million on a project now, it may save us &euro;20 million in five years' time. We should make the bold decision to invest now. This is particularly true of educational projects for children at risk as against prison spending. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to know that if we invest in early prevention measures for children at risk, in crisis or in dysfunctional communities, we will save millions of euro later in spending on our prisons. In this context one need only talk to John Lonergan, the governor of Mountjoy Prison. I spent 20 years working in the inner city and I have been saying this throughout: intervene early and spend at that stage, thereby reducing costs and the prison population.</P>
    <P>At one point 10% of my pupils were ending up in Mountjoy while only 1% of pupils from the north inner city were entering third level education. Radical changes need to be made to the structures of our educational services and this message is reinforced by John Lonergan and his colleagues in the prison service. It is time to challenge people on this issue and examine worthwhile, cost effective public projects that save children from our prisons. Not only is this good management of our finances, it is common sense to many people. These are the tough decisions and we must act now.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 6 which enables the agency to borrow money, in any currency, up to &euro;5 billion, even though I am not a fan of borrowing and I strongly believe in the ethic of paying our way through fair and balanced taxation. It may be old-fashioned but it is only proper. When we <Col N="445" />consider borrowing, we must look over our shoulder for tax dodgers and scam merchants. This is not simple left-wing rhetoric, to which the Minister may have referred on &ldquo;Marian Finucane&rdquo; this morning, but common sense to many of us who are on the left because we believe it works. The Revenue Commissioners tell us they were unable to collect &euro;987 million in a three year period from people who were clearly evading their taxes, yet we can never get resources to create residential places for 1,711 adults with disabilities. I challenge people to say this is left-wing rhetoric. Furthermore, the figure of &euro;987 million is conservative. There is always a problem or a shortage of cash when it comes to the most needy in our society and that must be highlighted.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the issuing of a report by the agency to the Minister for Finance not later than six months after the end of the financial year in relation to its activities for that year. Accountability is essential and particularly important when dealing with public money. Sadly, we have failed on this issue. We have many examples of bad practice and bad political leadership.</P>
    <P>The national development finance agency will assist the Government in evaluating financial risks and costs and ensure it avails of the best financial package for each project. This is the way forward and I welcome the debate on this important legislation. I take seriously many valuable sections of the Bill and will support them. Deputy Gilmore raised the question of the PPPs in relation to disadvantaged areas and I am sure this will emerge as a major issue. Overall, I strongly welcome the debate on this important Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O' Keeffe has said on a number of occasions that this is the most right-wing Government since the foundation of the State and I agree with him. The Government is ideologically driven. Its Thatcherite policies will ensure that wealthy people will be looked after unlike ordinary people who pay PAYE, who are on social welfare and who try to make an honest living. That sort of thinking is all over this Bill. The idea of the agency was mentioned during the general election campaign and was used as a smoke screen to give people the impression there was plenty of money and that everything promised by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil during that campaign could be delivered on. At the time, I pointed out in a public statement that the effect of the programmes proposed by the parties and the programme for Government would be cutbacks, a reduction of services and increases in charges. That is effectively what will happen as a result of this Bill if it is passed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is effectively a privatisation measure, whereby public private partnerships will design, build and operate public facilities. In practice, that means ordinary people will have to pay for certain services unlike before or for services they <Col N="446" />had to pay for before but whose charges were abolished as a result of political pressure. We will see situations where public water supply schemes will go to tender and will be designed, built and operated by a public private partnership &ndash; effectively private facilities &ndash; which will then attract water charges. We are told this will never happen but it has happened elsewhere and the idea of the Bill is to ensure that public facilities are built by public private partnerships which means new local charges will be introduced. For instance, sewage treatment facilities will be built in this way and we will face the introduction of local charges. Small business are already being charged for these facilities. National roads and bypasses built under this Bill will be tolled and ordinary motorists who already pay through the nose will have to pay even more.</P>
    <P>We are told that borrowing under this Bill is not really borrowing and that it is a bad thing. Borrowing for day to day expenditure is bad but there is nothing wrong with borrowing for good public infrastructural facilities like roads, railways, schools, water and sewage facilities. Our infrastructure is significantly worse than almost all our European partners and there is nothing wrong with borrowing to build these facilities. We currently borrow 34% and there is no reason we cannot borrow significantly more. During the Nice treaty referendum campaign, I said that instead of introducing a Bill like this, the Government should go back to Brussels to do what has already been done by other countries and seek to change the stability and growth pact. Our infrastructural services are so poor we need to be allowed to borrow more to build them. Portugal has already done this and there is increasing pressure on the European Union to change the system. France and Germany are already knocking on the door in this context and will be the next countries to demand their facilities be built and that they be allowed to borrow to do so, and we should do likewise.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty I have with this Bill is in relation to accountability. Will we have another situation, as with the National Roads Authority, in which there is no accountability to this House or to any Minister? When any question is raised in relation to roads, we are told it is a matter for the NRA. That is not acceptable and must not be part of this Bill if it ever gets beyond the starting blocks.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the regional balance of this proposed agency. Areas such as my constituency of Tipperary South are seriously lacking in infrastructural development, including roads. The Cashel bypass is now on hold again as a result of last week's Estimates. The closure of our rail line between Limerick Junction and Rosslare is being discussed. The electricity supply in south Tipperary and elsewhere in the south-east is not adequate for normal manufacturing industry. I am concerned that this agency would be a Dublin-based, Dublin-dominated body which would provide infrastructural services mainly to <Col N="447" />the eastern side of the country, to the detriment of south Tipperary and the west of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. The NDFA Bill has three purposes. One is to provide a central reference point where complicated financial transactions associated with public private partnerships can be examined and a true cost, as well as the proportion of risk being undertaken by the private sector, can be determined. It is disappointing that there has been little consultation in relation to this Bill with the private sector, including IBEC and prospective large funding sources. In effect, the Government is looking to the private sector to bail it out as the Exchequer has been drained of funds. The Bill will also enable the NDFA to borrow money for investment in public private partnerships where it is cheaper to do so and where the relevant Minister or the authority wishes to adopt this approach. It also facilitates the establishment of special purpose companies to finance specific, financially viable projects such as toll roads, while remaining outside of the State's balance sheet and outside the constraints of the Maastricht 3% restriction.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a significant infrastructural deficit in terms of roads, tunnels, bridges, hospitals, etc. Under the Maastricht restrictions, the cost cannot be met immediately from Exchequer funds. That would be tantamount to paying the full cost of one's house from one's income for the first year of ownership. Other countries have also followed the route of public private partnerships to deal with this situation and, in many cases, have paid large sums of money to the private sector. The private sector in some countries is said to have got a return of 20% to 25% on its equity investment previously and even now expects a return of over 15%. It is also understood that the amount of risk transferred to the private sector is quite small.</P>
      <P>In the context of the present massive national Exchequer deficit and the need for a cautious approach to borrowing, the Minister for Finance has remained silent on the use of the resources of the national pensions fund to finance capital projects. That has very significant attractions. While future trends are more promising, millions were written off the value in past years. We should certainly avoid the reckless approach of channelling over &euro;1,000 million of borrowed money into foreign stock markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public private partnerships can work very well. A new school which will open in Tubbercurry next week was built in record time under that system. In following that route, returns to the private sector should be kept as low as is consistent with getting projects into operation. If the private sector is being paid for risk taking, it must actually take that risk on board rather than passing it off to somebody else. Otherwise, the Government of the day will carry the risk. The private sector <Col N="448" />must carry its due share of the risk or the hit, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of the Bill is to continue as rapidly as possible with the development of new infrastructure while keeping the cost of the financial packages to a minimum. Following the general election promises, the tills are now empty. There is also a remarkable silence with regard to development in the west of Ireland, including my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, in contrast to the fanfare of announcements in connection with the promotion of the BMW region and cross-Border funding over the previous five years. The Sligo inner relief route is a typical example of promises made at successive elections now being put on hold indefinitely. The people of Sligo will not continue to tolerate that treatment by Fianna Fáil, which evidently regards that constituency as one of its safest electoral bases, with two Fianna Fáil Deputies and four Senators. It is incumbent on that large group of Government Deputies and Senators to ensure that funding is provided for the relief route project. They should make the necessary approaches to the Minister for Finance in that regard.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers have emphasised, the proposed new agency must have a regional focus. The borrowing powers of the agency should be carefully considered and there should be appropriate priorities as to where the money will be spent. The attractions of the BMW region must be fully promoted with a view to correcting the present imbalance of development in favour of the east coast counties. Despite the emphasis on cross-Border issues in the debate on the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill, this Government has completely failed to channel funding into the Border counties. Instead of action, there has been nothing more than talk and lip-service.</P>
    <P>Given that we are dealing with taxpayers' money in this context, the management of the funds involved is vitally important. The waste of resources in the economy has been unwise and has led to the cutbacks which are now being imposed. How could the cost of major infrastructural projects possibly have escalated by up to 60%? How can the Government account for that at a time when unit costs were not increasing significantly? Were the initial costings carried out competently and correctly? The Government has a major responsibility to ensure that the public finances are properly managed. All projects and contracts should be on the basis of closed budgets. As in the case of any private enterprise operation, agreed budgets should be adhered to and overruns should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>This country's poor infrastructure has economic and social consequences. It would be a grave mistake on the part of the Government not to proceed with infrastructural development. I am supportive of Government borrowing to continue with the national development plan according to a stated timescale. We should be honest with the people. They want to be told the truth. Will the inner relief road go ahead? Will the N4 go ahead? <Col N="449" />Will the N17 go ahead? The people want to know. We have a highly intelligent electorate. I hope this agency will be accountable to the Dáil and that it is not another quango. If we put down a question for the Minister I hope the reply will not be that this is not his responsibility. I hope the Minister will clarify this and that this agency will be accountable to the Dáil and will answer the questions we are elected to ask. I hope the Minister will not say in two months' time, or next year, that this is not the responsibility of the Dáil and he cannot comment on it. The Oireachtas represents the people and it must have a voice. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that elected members have a say in questions on infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There is mounting evidence of problems in managing the national investment. A number of recent reports have criticised the management of aspects of the NDP and there are serious questions as to how it will be funded. The cost of the plan has increased to &euro;80 billion. The Minister for Finance has a twin problem. In the short-term he faces demands for more money to be added to the investment plans already announced on budget day. That is a major problem. He is now hiving off the national development plan and putting it under the remit of another agency.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with the growth of the country. There is road congestion and public transport is all over the place. The rolling stock on the Sligo line is more than 50 years old. It has no heating, no canteen and people can be delayed at Enfield. There is a continuous track, to give credit where it is due. It is a contradiction to invest in new rolling stock without carriages. The business exists. Up to &euro;100 million has been spent on the Dublin Luas system. That money was spent wisely but it will be unwise if we do not get the rolling stock to justify the investment.</P>
    <P>The rising cost of projects was due to construction inflation, the poor initial costing of some projects, increased costs in areas such as land acquisition and change in design. The report estimates that the cost of projects rose by 52% over two years from 2000 to 2001. This meant that by the end of 2001 the road programme was already well behind schedule. The cost of transport, health infrastructure environment and housing increased by 25% to 30% in the two years. A crucial issue to be faced is the financing of the entire programme. The numbers are daunting, there will be a &euro;9 billion deficit. In other words, the cost of completing the NDP has risen from &euro;26 billion to at least &euro;35 billion. We are talking about accelerated costs and it makes good sense to borrow and get on with the job. It is equally important to get value for money and return for the investment. When the cost increases by 52% in two years, it indicates that something is wrong.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the level of development, the level of spin and the number of spin doctors employed by the Government since 1997. We have paid dearly for it. The NCC report and recommendations are frightening. They deal with <Col N="450" />the implementation of the recommendations and what will make the country competitive. There is now an enlarged Europe and business is attracted elsewhere. Private enterprise is the unsung hero in this country. People have taken the risk, invested in business and got very little in return. Those who put a huge investment into tourism are not getting the return. There is no evidence of a return on agricultural investment. The National Treasury Management Agency operates a very successful pension fund. It is an example of good management.</P>
    <P>There should be no ambiguity about the running of the agency, how the funds will be spent, the priorities in health, road infrastructure and schools. The garda station in Ballymote, a district station with 27 garda, does not even have facilities for interviewing witnesses. Those brought in on remand cannot be kept overnight. The Minister talked today about taping facilities for interviews in Garda stations. There are not even interview facilities in Ballymote and it is a district station with a superintendent. I hope the Minister will visit it. A crashed vehicle cannot even be parked there, yet it serves the south Sligo region as far as Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    <P>We can all talk about the development of the regions but people in business cannot even park a car in the middle of Sligo. This road will be deferred. Plans for the N17 have been deferred. The N4 Castlebaldwin bypass has been deferred. That is the reality. The Government can put a spin on it, can set up funding agencies and talk the talk. It is not, however, walking the walk and making improvements on the ground. It is unjust that the money of taxpayers in the west is not being re-invested in the area. They are entitled to equal treatment.</P>
    <P>A major development is proposed for a new psychiatric unit at Sligo General Hospital. The consultants told me last week that the administration block of this unit is excluded, althoughit costs only 0.5% of the overall project. They were told they could have 36 beds but no facilities for doctors or counselling. The Department has cut off the funding. This is very bad value for money because in five years' time they will be building an extension which incorporates these facilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of this agency but I hope it is not another quango created by the Minister. A year and a half ago he was know as &ldquo;Champagne Charlie&rdquo;, telling us to party on, the good times will last forever. I was told this week that an old person who wants an essential repairs grant for heating may be charged an application fee by Sligo County Council. Not only have things gone that bad, but there is no guarantee that the person in question will receive the grant. The Estimates show that there will be massive cuts in funding for health boards and county councils. The fact that all politics is local is emphasised when one encounters an elderly couple looking for an essential repairs grant. I met a lady this week who is looking for respite care. It will cost <Col N="451" />the State about &euro;250 per week to accommodate her in a private nursing home, but it will not pay for two hours' care from a carer at home. Does the Minister, Deputy McDowell, believe that represents value for money? I do not think it does.</P>
    <P>We are fed up of spin from the Government. It cannot blame Fine Gael for the economic crisis, as there was a budget surplus of &euro;2.5 billion when its last term in Government ended in 1997, compared to a deficit of &euro;2.5 billion now. The Government is cooking the books. Although Deputy McCreevy is a wonderfully imaginative accountant, he has failed dismally as Minister for Finance. I hope that whoever takes over the financing of the National Development Finance Agency will be much more honest and transparent in his or her business dealings. As elected Members, we should be told what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>The name of this Bill should refer to the fact that it is being introduced as part of the Government's attempts to get out of the mess it has made of the country. Perhaps it should reflect the Government's concerns about how it is going to get money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry was correct to say that past financial troubles, similar to those we face at present, were blamed on Fine Gael if we happened to have been in Government for a short time. We always came in to clean up the mess made by Fianna Fáil, but we were lucky, in a way, that we did not get into Government on this occasion. Fianna Fáil, the party that created the mess, has to deal with it. In all my time in politics, no Administration has ever mishandled the public finances to the same extent as this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The squandering of money in this country in recent times has been outrageous. If a company in the United States or Australia was experiencing a downturn in its business of the nature we are encountering and was looking for ways of saving money, would it do what the Government has done in terms of recruitment to the health boards and local authorities? The Government's local <Col N="452" />government initiative, entitled Better Local Government, involved new buildings and extra staff and has cost taxpayers a fortune. Despite the new officers, the standard of service has remained poor. I asked a parliamentary question last week about the increases in local authority staff throughout the State and I discovered that the local authority is probably the greatest employer in many counties. Allergen employs 1,000 people in Westport, but it does not employ as many people as Mayo County Council, which has increased its staff numbers by nearly 400 in the past three years.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister, Deputy McDowell, or a member of his staff, to telephone Mayo County Council tomorrow, because I guarantee he will have difficulty finding somebody to help him. The officials will be out looking at new offices in new buildings. Some of them may be looking for furniture to put in the offices. The sad thing is that taxpayers are paying for it.</P>

      <P>No, but I am not afraid to say that I would like to see value for money. I want the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to do his job and his officials to check what local authority workers are doing to earn the money they are paid. I want the Government to explain how services have improved since the introduction of Better Local Government, as I think we have received poor value for money.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is leaving because I have a few things to say about the Progressive Democrats that I would not like to say in his absence. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is from my part of the country and he will understand the points I have to make about roads in the west. He knows what happens when the Taoiseach comes to County Mayo.</P>

      <P>This Bill relates to how we should spend our money, but I want to know the Government's priorities for the west. I know what this Bill is all about, although I hate saying it because my friends and the ushers think I am always complaining about Dublin. I have nothing against Dublin and I like Dublin people. Many Dublin people tell those of us from the west how we should live, even though they have made a mess of Dublin. One cannot move freely across Dublin. A Deputy told me this morning that it takes him nearly three hours to travel seven miles to this House each morning. It is not good enough.</P>

      <P>I invite the Minister to talk about economic success to the thousands of commuters who are trying to travel home this evening, but who cannot get across the city because of the poor DART service or the level of traffic congestion. The Government has made a mess of Dublin's transport services, as the Minister of State knows. The people know it too and they are waiting in the long grass for the Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the N5 and the lack of infrastructure in the west. This Bill is about how to get money to deal with the traffic problems in Dublin and along the roads in and out of Dublin, but it is not concerned with rural Ireland, especially the west. Those involved in implementing the Bill are interested in going to rural Ireland only on holidays or to do some shooting. As the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, knows, sheep farmers and small farmers are going out of business. European policy, supported by the Government, is encouraging people to leave rural Ireland on a daily basis.</P>

The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has to admit that the Government's policy during the past five years supports such ideas. No money has been allocated to improve the N5. The plans to improve the national primary route between Westport and Castlebar were scuttled by the National Roads Authority last week.</P>

      <P>When <i>Nealon's Guide to the 29th Dáil &amp; Seanad</i> was published last week, I checked every constituency to see if any representatives of the National Roads Authority were elected to the Oireachtas.

I realise he is only a Minister of State, but perhaps Deputy Treacy will be able to answer a simple question I put down this week. Are Ministers and Ministers of State exempt from the penalty points system? I will have to make a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to find out the answer to this question. Are senior Ministers in State cars travelling from Dublin to Galway or Mayo exempt from the penalty points system? Will the Minister answer the question?</P>

      <P>I heard a junior Minister tell us this evening that we would be provided with gas in Castlebar, Westport and every part of County Mayo. He is wrong. Bord Gáis tells me that if the gas comes out at all it will be brought into Ballina, up to Sligo, to Northern Ireland and over to Scotland. The Minister is a west of Ireland man, yet he will not provide the funding for a bit of infrastructure to be put in place so that the gas can be supplied to the area from which it comes. This is a natural resource in the west of Ireland and we are asking the Minister to provide the funding to pipe it into Castlebar, Westport and every town in County Mayo: to give us, for once, a small advantage so that if industrialists come to the county they can find something that is cheaper than elsewhere. It is a reasonable request. We sold away the rights to this gas. We gave it to big business and to people outside the State. We have almost no control over it ourselves. We will only have control if the Minister gives money to Bord Gáis to provide the service &ndash; to pipe the gas into every town and village in counties Mayo, Galway, Sligo or Leitrim. For once the west of Ireland should be given an advantage.</P>
      <P>If this famous agency ever gets up and running it will have officials from all parts of County Dublin saying these things are not viable. Like the roads in the west, it is not viable. That will be their answer. Of course, they will not have to come into this House to say it. They will write that to the Minister, who will write to me and say that he has no responsibility for this. That is why I am against it. It is a way out for the Government, which has squandered every single penny.</P>
      <P>In my own county last night nine people were on the corridors of Mayo General Hospital, where there was not even a bed for them. Is that not a disgrace? Is it not outrageous that we spend billions on spin doctors and consultants' reports when poor people are lying on trolleys in hospitals? People out there will make their voices heard when they get the opportunity. The spin doctors spun well in May and they certainly codded the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give credit where it is due to the former Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke. We had a disastrous rail service in the west for many years. Now the lines have been improved &ndash; the tracks have been put in place &ndash; but we do not have the trains. We do have some Third World trains that have been sent to the west over the last number of years. Iarnród Éireann has now decided that it will not carry freight to or from the west of Ireland. The roads from Dublin to Mayo, Cork, Kerry or wherever are clogged up every day with lorries holding up the traffic. A person can leave Mayo, Cork or <Col N="456" />Kerry at any hour of the day or night and see lorries bringing goods in and out of Dublin city. If we had a proper policy on freight this would not be happening. It would not be happening if we had a Minister who took control of his Department and brought in the necessary legislation to make sure that Iarnród Éireann carries freight in and out of County Mayo.</P>
    <P>I heard a previous speaker refer to a company, Allergan, which employs almost 1,000 people in my town. When this company sends goods from my town to Dublin and abroad, the complaint is regularly sent back that the goods have been damaged. They get damaged between Westport and Longford. After Longford the road to Dublin is not so bad but from Longford to Westport it is a Third World road. This is not right. We deserve the same kind of infrastructure as any other part of the country. I travelled recently to Cork and to Wexford and saw fine motorways. Last year there were traffic lights in Strokestown. It was not that there was so much traffic going in and out, but that two cars could not be allowed to pass each other on a national primary route because it was dangerous. The traffic lights were there to make sure that only one car went up and down the road. That is not right.</P>

People who were able to train themselves and do some good work for the community have been attacked. The next attack &ndash; I know some journalists do not like what I am saying &ndash; was on the home help service. The poor creatures at home with no-one to look after them, except for a few hours a day, were attacked by central government. I do not know what this Bill will do for them. Will anything be done?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the National Development Finance Agency Bill, 2002. It is nothing more than a thinly disguised project to provide for major privatisation of crucial public utilities and services.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memoranda to the Bill states that it is to provide for the cost effective financing for priority infrastructure as an alternative to up-front Exchequer funding or &ldquo;unsuitable&rdquo; private sector funding. Unsuitable private sector funding by its very definition could not be used. The development agency provided for here will find alternatives to public funding. It will push aside public funding in key infrastructural projects and services so that private capitalists can move in, take over and make a killing in the process.</P>
      <P>This Bill is from the top drawer of IBEC. Chris Dooley, industry and employment correspondent of <i>The Irish Times,</i> writing on 11 November, stated:</P>
      <P>Employers have called for &ldquo;as many Government services as possible&rdquo; to be outsourced to the private sector as part of a new national partnership agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" />In talks with the other social partners, IBEC has also called for the transport and energy markets to liberalised as a priority action in dealing with inflation.</P>
    <P>In other words, it wants to privatise the buses, the rail network and ESB. The article also states:</P>
    <P>As part of a ten-point plan to tackle inflation, it said as many Government services as possible should be outsourced to the private sector, should be &ldquo;fast-tracked&rdquo; through greater use of public-private partnerships.</P>
    <P>That is the IBEC programme and that is the programme the Minister for Finance is presenting to us in this Bill. The bosses command and the Minister for Finance dances to attention. That it why the National Development Finance Agency Bill is before the House.</P>
    <P>How can finance from private capitalists be more cost effective than the State for public projects since the State can raise funds more cheaply than anyone else? Private capitalists will want a substantial return on whatever funds they will put in. That return will be paid by the taxpayer, squeezed out of the citizen, in road tolls and the like.</P>
    <P>The best known example of public private partnership is the West-Link toll bridge in my constituency. It was built several years ago by a private company. It has turned into a gold mine for National Toll Roads, the company that built and operates it. In the last figures available on its website, in the first six months of 2000, it had profits of &euro;9.3 million. That is paid for by hard pressed motorists, usually workers going to and from work, who already pay significant taxes as PAYE workers, are taxed on the cars they are obliged to drive because of the abysmal nature of public transport and on the fuel they consume in their cars. To get to work, however, they are further held to ransom by this private company.</P>
    <P>The effects of this project are entirely anti-social. The West-Link toll bridge is the biggest obstacle to traffic flow in Dublin. Hard pressed workers, after a hard day, have to sit in queues from the West-Link toll bridge all the way back to Finglas if they are going south. The converse must be endured on the way to work. This is the reality of what is being provided for in the National Development Finance Agency Bill. The Government wants to replicate the West-Link toll bridge in bypasses and bridges around the country and hold to ransom the people in the provinces as much as those in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Some of the examples of public private partnership, which is at an early stage in some crucial services, bear out the utter impracticality of the idea. It will not work. It will not provide the quality services it is supposed to provide. I predict there will be chaos in areas of the public sector such as education into which it is now being extended.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has a public private partnership project, signed in Nov<Col N="460" />ember 2001 with Jarvis Projects Limited, to design, build, finance and operate five schools. The capital cost of the schools is &euro;60.64 million and the Minister is entering into a 20 year contract with this firm to service these schools. He is providing at this stage a total of &euro;244 million for that purpose. Projecting in advance in this way is absolutely ludicrous. As happened in Britain, public private partnerships, or the private finance initiative as it is often called there, will be a rip-off of the public purse and taxpayers and a source of unending frustration to the communities depending on these services.</P>
    <P>We know that much more is coming down the road in this regard. During the course of the Nice treaty debate, I highlighted on behalf of the Socialist Party, as did others, the drive by the EU Commission to introduce a regime of widespread privatisation of crucial public utilities and services such as water, the post office, electricity and so on. Following ratification of the Nice treaty, the EU Commission will be in negotiations with the World Trade Organisation to bring about a situation where there will be massive pressure on this State and other states to privatise crucial services, such as water services, that the Irish people would not even think of removing from public hands.</P>
    <P>Surely we should learn from the rip-off which is occurring in Britain and which is a source of scandal on an increasingly frequent basis in that jurisdiction. My Socialist Party colleague and former Member of Parliament, Councillor Dave Nellist, brought to my attention an instructive example. He is currently a councillor in Coventry. Some ten years ago plans were drawn up to fully modernise two national health service hospitals in the Coventry area at a cost of £60 million. The Tory Government then went on its binge of public finance initiatives &ndash; privatisation in reality &ndash; and it was decided in that context to build one hospital by a private company, which would be privately owned and then leased back to the National Health Service for the following 30 years. The price then began to increase relentlessly. In April 1999, the figure put on the project was £174 million. Some time later it was £290 million and now it is to be built for a price put by the builders of approximately £370 million. Therefore, my colleague summarises the farce, except it is at the expense of British taxpayers and the sick. In a few short years they have gone from two public National Health Service hospitals to a proposal for a single privately-owned hospital, leased to the National Health Service, with less beds, less staff, in a location no one wants and so far costing more than six times the price of modernisation of our two hospitals. He concludes by saying, &ldquo;No wonder PFI stands for profits from illness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the reality of what the whole process is about. The process is about milking the public purse and, despite all that is said in the Bill about the provision for special purpose companies and the declaration that these special companies will not be able to call on the Exchequer for any bad <Col N="461" />debts and so on, it is inevitable that down the line taxpayers will have to bail out these projects which will go on the rocks. What we will have is a severe deterioration in services because the thrust of whatever private company is involved in the design, build and operation of crucial utilities will be to maximise private profit and a return to shareholders who very often are multinational corporations, big financial institutions and so on. That is their <i>raison d'être,</i> not to provide public services for ordinary people in society to the best extent possible.</P>
    <P>Moving on to some of the specific provisions in the Bill, the board of the national development finance agency, if set up, will be appointed by the Minister for Finance. Given the Minister for Finance and the Government we have at present who are absolutely wedded to privatisation, the ethos of private capitalism and domination by multinational corporations, there will be appointed to that board primarily representatives of big business and people who share the right-wing ideology of the Minister. I am amazed at the weakness of the provision in the Bill which provides for the arising of a conflict of interest. Of course, there is an absolutely fundamental conflict of interest in having big business representatives on the national development finance agency board when as private capitalists they have a vested interest in steering as much of these projects as possible in their direction and at terms favourable to private capital.</P>
    <P>Should the conflict of interest be proved to have arisen in a specific sense, apart from the general conflict of interest, section 15 does not lay out any disciplinary code or disciplinary measures whatsoever for a board member, or indeed for staff or other senior people, shown to have a conflict of interest. In regard to senior staff or others, the Bill states that the Minister for Finance will decide appropriate action. Why is the consequence of a conflict of interest not provided for in the Bill?</P>
    <P>There is a further extraordinary section 18, which is amazing and must be changed. It provides that the board of the national development finance agency can be questioned by the Committee of Public Accounts. However, section 18(7) states:</P>
    <P>The Chief Executive Officer and the Chairperson, if required under subsection (6) to give evidence, shall not:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the Attorney General or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) produce or send to a committee a specified document in which the Chief Executive Officer or the Chairperson questions or expresses an opinion on the merits of any such policy or such objectives.</P>
    <P>This is absolutely extraordinary. This is supposed to be one of the most powerful committees of <Col N="462" />Dáil Éireann which represents taxpayers. However, the chief executive officer of this agency, that is to have control of up to &euro;5 billion in funding, will not be able to say to elected representatives that a policy the Minister obliges them to carry out is bad value for money or is not in the interests of the taxpayer. If this happened in a Stalinist society, it would be called heavy-handed. It has to go.</P>

      <P>Other speakers have referred to this Bill in various ways to describe what it is supposed to do. However, we all know what it is really meant to do.

      <P>Ironically, the outgoing Government in 1997 had left the country in good running order. All of the economic fundamentals were right but the 1977 spending splurge was ultimately referred to by the present Minister for Finance as a debacle that he did not contribute to. He said that it was badly thought out, a terrible thing to do and should never have happened. At the same time, he coyly admitted that some of his colleagues were elected to this House on the back of it. I presume that served his purpose.</P>

      <P>The incoming 1977 Government's slogan was: &ldquo;Put more money in people's pockets.&rdquo;  It did not say that it was going to shove its hand back into the pockets to take the money <Col N="463" />back out. That was the slogan and the people paid a heavy price for it.</P>
      <P>In 1987, a similar scenario came about. This time the slogan was: &ldquo;There is a better way.&rdquo;</P>

It was a difficult way and the better way became the hatchet. After that, everything was happy and quiet until 1997. The slogan then was: &ldquo;People before politics.&rdquo;  The Government kept its eye on the people all the time. Whatever the public was up to, the organisation across the House had its eye on them all the time. The 1997 Government drew up a five year plan to cod the people out of their money once again. During that five years &ndash; and this is what I mean by giving out money then putting a hand back in people's pockets to get it back again &ndash; the Government sold to the people and taxpayers something they already owned &ndash; Eircom. It was sold for more than &euro;3 billion.</P>

      <P>I will make my accusations through the Chair. Lest you feel accused, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was directing my remarks across the House. I am delighted to see my constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, arriving in the House. I do not have to regale him with what he said about 1977 because he remembers well what he said, and fully agrees with me.</P>
      <P>I was discussing how the Government put its hands into people's pockets to get their ill-gotten gains, as the Government saw it. After Eircom was sold, it was time to go after the people again. Lest the people get over-elated about the profits they expected to make as a result of investing in a national institution, the Government said it wanted that money. Another organisation sent letters in the post to tell shareholders that they must sell their shares at roughly 40% of the price paid for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a nice way to treat the public. Having conned them into the purchase of the shares, <Col N="464" />which they already owned as it was a State company, the new company said that the shares had to be sold. I can understand how the Opposition was perplexed.</P>

A former constituency colleague of Deputy McCreevy, Mr. Paddy Power, used to tell a great story about the mushroom factor.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the mushroom factor is to keep the people in the dark as long as possible; they are not to know the true circumstances until well after the election. However, something misfired and about a week after the election Ministers began to feel uneasy. There was a noticeable shifting of feet and lack of exuberance in the way they went about their business. I thought they had gone silent on the economy because they had caught a cold or some other malady had befallen them. Before the election we were told we had the best economy in the world and the fundamentals were in place. Two years before, when the European Commission warned that we were overspending, the Government said it was not the case and the Commission was interfering.</P>

      <P>Most economists world-wide marvelled at how quickly the Irish economy transformed from a surplus to a deficit. In various arenas, many more capable people than me are trying to work out what happened, how it happened, and what its purposes were. The purpose was to get past the general election at all costs.</P>
      <P>Following the general election of 1977 and all its attendant baggage, the Government established a National Treasury Management Agency to look after some things that had gone wrong. The NTMA has worked quite well and done a good job. In this case a new way of thinking has been uncovered. This time, in anticipation of its future electoral intentions, the Government has established a new agency that it will be able to blame when the planning and economic thinking goes wrong. No responsibility will fall on the Opposition, Fianna Fáil or the protectors of the national economic interest, the Progressive Democrats &ndash; the watchdog that has neither teeth nor bark &ndash; because the agency will take the responsibility. The agency will not be answerable to this House &ndash; past agencies were &ndash; and the ultimate quango is about to unfold. This agency will be given the responsibility of doing the dirty work for which Ministers do not want to be held politically accountable. This is a dangerous development and one that is intended to mislead the people. The people have been led astray for long enough by those on the Government benches. They were led astray in 1977 and again in 1997. It is unfair of the Government to ask the public to have any more patience with it. The public does not want the Opposition to give its imprimatur to the establishment of an agency to cover-up future mistakes.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a number of Deputies relating the Bill to their constituencies, drawing on the various deficits those constituencies have and wondering what it will do for this. When this was first mooted, a headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 26 April read: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil boxes clever with big idea of finance agency.&rdquo;  Denis Coghlan, that newspaper's political correspondent wrote: &ldquo;There was a touch of McCreevy magic about the Development Finance Agency idea&rdquo;. This is a clever way of borrowing money without it being seen as Exchequer borrowing. In principle it looks fine, this agency will function through the NTMA, but could not the Minister have created a mechanism or committee of the NTMA to carry out the functions of the national development finance agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas I agree with all speakers that there is a need to find money to fund various projects, I cannot see this body making much difference. I know it will enable the borrowing of a lot of money, but I do not know that it will provide the necessary finance to help peripheral areas.

      <P>The Private Members' motion tabled by members of the Labour Party purports to address two issues in relation to the Morris inquiry. I would like to comment on both of them. Paragraph two calls on Dáil Éireann to instruct the Government to use its power to have the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal widened. Paragraph three raises the question of costs.</P>
      <P>Both Houses of the Oireachtas passed a resolution on 28 March 2002 providing for the establishment of a tribunal under the Tribunal of Inquiry Acts, 1921 to 1998, to inquire urgently into certain definite matters of urgent public importance relating to complaints concerning some gardaí in the Donegal division. These definite matters constitute the terms of reference of the tribunal and are set out in some detail. On 24 April this year the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under that resolution appointed the Honourable Mr. Justice Morris as the sole member of the tribunal to inquire into the matters identified in the resolution.</P>
      <P>There are two methods of amending the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal. These are set out in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998. The 1998 legislation is clear on this point. One method of amending the terms of reference set out in the 1998 Act is for the tribunal to request such an amendment. If that happens, the Minister must amend the instrument establishing the tribunal, provided an appropriate resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. In effect, the tribunal takes the initiative under this route and if the tribunal is supported by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister has a passive role and must end the instrument accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second method of amending the terms of reference is also set out in the 1998 Act. This method can be initiated by the Minister. He may ask the Attorney General to consult with the tribunal and if the tribunal consents, the Minister may amend the relevant instrument, provided an appropriate resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Either the tribunal or the Minister may initiate the process, but in both cases it is clear the tribunal has the final say. The legislation on this point is clear, but the motion tabled by the Labour Party Deputies is not consistent with the legislation. Are the Members who signed the motion aware that even if it was accepted, it <Col N="469" />would not have any effect? There is no provision for Dáil Éireann to instruct the Government to initiate a consultation with the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who signed the motion must be aware of the tribunal's recent rulings on the issue of extending its terms of reference. The tribunal stated it could not possibly adjudicate on an application to extend the terms of reference unless material had been advanced on why an extension of the terms of reference should be sought. The tribunal indicated that it would be willing to consider arguments or submissions grounded on evidence, but that a mere assertion or request for an extension of the terms of reference was not sufficient. That is the practice of the tribunal and the position it has adopted. If we apply those standards or criteria to the motion before us, I would not like to have to appear before the tribunal and to argue a case based on what has been said during this debate.</P>
    <P>It is useful to recall the background to the existing terms of reference. This affair arose from the tragic death of Mr. Barron in 1996. We still do not know the details of his death and no person has been brought to account for it. It is important that we do not lose sight of this matter as it is the most serious aspect of the Donegal affair. I understand concerns were raised as early as 1997 with the then Minister for Justice and former Deputy, Nora Owen, about the handling of the investigation into the death of Mr. Barron. The subsequent Garda investigation led to a file being submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions early in 1998. However, no prosecution was initiated on foot of that file. Subsequently, a number of highly disturbing events happened, including the issuing by the gardaí of a significant number of summonses against a particular owner of a licensed premises. These summonses were not proceeded with on the instructions of the Director of Public Prosecutions. There were allegations of harassment, of control of alleged arms dumps by members of the Garda Síochána and of impropriety by members of the Garda Síochána in the conduct of prosecutions. Many of these matters were outlined in the opening statement of the tribunal which is now in session.</P>
    <P>Following the DPP's decision on the summonses and reflecting the widespread unease about the position in Donegal, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to conduct an investigation in February 1999. The House was informed of the position by the then Minister. I understand the Carty investigation was comprehensive and covered a variety of matters. It has already been praised by counsel for the tribunal. It looked at the Garda investigation into Mr. Barron's death and at allegations of harassment and that certain gardaí were involved in hoax bomb making equipment finds. In July 2000 a file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration and a number of persons were charged. I understand that there were at least two other Garda investigations. There were complaints to the Garda Complaints <Col N="470" />Board and there were a number of civil actions. More than 30 civil actions against the State have been instituted by different parties in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that Mr. Shane Murphy, senior counsel, who was nominated by the chairman of the Bar Council, was appointed in November 2001 to carry out an independent review of all the papers to determine whether all the necessary steps had been taken with due diligence and expedition and to advise what further actions might be taken. Mr. Murphy submitted his report early in 2001. We have been told that Mr. Murphy's main conclusion was that a tribunal of inquiry should be established. He made recommendations as to what those terms of reference should be and they have been included in the terms of reference for the Morris tribunal. It is striking to note that Mr. Murphy was asked in his report to look specifically at whether all the necessary steps had been taken with due diligence and expedition. Having looked at all the papers, he seemed to think there was not a problem because he did not include any such provision in the proposed terms of reference for the tribunal. Yet the Labour Party is trying to raise the same type of issue which apparently was rejected by Mr. Murphy as unnecessary and, more recently, by the Morris tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In all the circumstances I cannot see any substance to the argument that the terms of reference should be extended on the lines proposed by the Labour Party motion. As I pointed out some time ago, there are two routes available. It can happen at the initiative of the Minister or of the tribunal. The tribunal is now in session. The open approach put forward by the Minister in his amendment, which reflects to some degree the rulings of the tribunal, is the right one. There are no grounds for amending the terms of reference at this stage. If the tribunal runs into any difficulties or if new issues come to light, the matter can be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>As regards costs, the natural sympathy of anyone would be to push us towards the fact that no innocent person should suffer. We have all heard stories about the huge expense and we know the huge expense involved in having legal representation. Considering what has been said, when I looked at the relevant legislation, I was surprised to find that there are already comprehensive provisions which mean that every person who is granted representation before a tribunal will get their legal costs, provided they co-operate with the tribunal. Logically, co-operation can only be assessed at the end of a process. In case there is any doubt, I will refer to the specific provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002, allow a tribunal, which is of opinion that having regard to its findings and all other relevant matters there are sufficient reasons rendering it <Col N="471" />equitable to do so, to order the whole or part of the costs of representation of a person appearing before it to be paid. When determining whether costs should be paid, a tribunal may also may take into account failure to co-operate or provide assistance or knowingly giving false or misleading information. In effect, the legal costs of participants are guaranteed in advance though actual payments are not made in advance. The Minister made the point about equitable treatment and I endorse what he said. We cannot show favouritism to particular individuals or their advisers, nor can we prejudge their cases. In this regard, I am surprised the Labour Party motion refers only to one family. I acknowledge the hurt and suffering that family has endured, but we cannot justify discrimination on any grounds. As the Minister said, equity requires that all parties to a tribunal be treated equally. To cover in advance the legal costs of all parties would be to pre-empt the power of the tribunal not to award costs to those who do not co-operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unprecedented that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is the parent body in this case, should not be included in the terms of reference. The McBrearty family is the family mainly concerned, which means quite clearly that its members will be entitled to costs at the end. These people have already incurred enormous costs because of the various things that have happened to them. The family would not wish to discriminate against any other family that is to be awarded costs and its members are not seeking this on a selfish basis. Will the Minister of State consider the matter in that light? A particular family has incurred enormous costs prior to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has effectively reopened the whole basis of the argument we are having. A fundamental principle at issue here is that the tribunal decides on costs and we appoint the chairman to adjudge such matters. To make a decision on costs in advance of the inquiry, no matter how meritorious the application, would, in effect, pre-empt the work of the tribunal. That is a cardinal point of which we must not lose sight in the debate.</P>

      <P>It is never desirable, as a matter of general principle, to guarantee costs in advance of legal proceedings, which is effectively the direction of this motion. Decisions on costs have to be made by the person conducting the inquiry. If we commit these inquiries to a tribunal, we commit them to chairmen who have to make decisions on costs which are intrinsically bound up with the fact-finding powers of the chair. As the Minister said, equity requires that all parties to the tribunal be treated equally and to cover in advance the legal costs of all parties would pre-empt the power of the tribunals in that regard.</P>

The Opposition is speaking out of both sides of its mouth. As part of the democratic process in this House that agreed the terms of reference, the Opposition should now stand up and be counted. Is the Opposition saying it does not trust the judgment of Mr. Justice Morris or the way in which he is proceeding with the tribunal?</P>

      <P>It is a matter for this House but not exclusively so. How long has the tribunal been running? We should give it ample scope and opportunity to do its work. That does not mean at some future date there will be no opportunity for the House or the Minister to change the terms of reference if they see fit. I contend it is slightly premature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" />I wish to speak on seeking the inclusion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department and the Attorney General and citing them specifically. All citizens of this country and all Departments of Government owe a duty of care, consideration and diligence to co-operate fully with any tribunal. It is not necessary to cite individuals or Departments to get their co-operation because it is the duty of every citizen in the State to co-operate fully with the tribunal. Therefore, that is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Sexton, referred to the issue of costs. Essentially one is signing a blank cheque. Any person of limited means would have reservations about coming before a tribunal as it is expensive. I sympathise with the McBrearty family in this instance, but everybody must be treated equally before the tribunal. Because of that one cannot pre-empt what decisions will be made. The experience of tribunals has been that generally persons who have co-operated have had their costs granted to them, and the level of co-operation can only be judged at the end of the process as opposed to the beginning. While I have sympathy for anybody who is called before it because it is a major financial undertaking, and essentially one is signing a blank cheque, it would not be appropriate to agree costs in advance.</P>
    <P>In regard to his amendment, the Minister rightly pointed out it was Shane Murphy who carried out an independent investigation of the terms of reference drawn up by the Bar Council which were accepted by the Dáil. It is slightly premature to seek to amend them at this stage. The House remains open to any amendment in the future. It would be second-guessing certain results if we were to amend the terms at this early stage.</P>
    <P>The public is rightly concerned about events that took place in Donegal. In regard to various tribunals, my colleague previously mentioned that our dirty linen is being washed, and let us hope it is washed properly. While there are many good gardaí, this is not the time to ensure the Garda is taught a lesson. The Minister in his own good time and through legislation will make the necessary changes within the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon) Tom Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Morris tribunal. It is regrettable, however, that it should ever have come to this. The allegations of wrongdoing and impropriety which have been made against members of the Garda Síochána are of the utmost seriousness and it is in the interests of us all to ensure that public confidence in the Garda Síochána is restored as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment to the motion. In moving his amendment he has taken the essence of what the Labour Party wished to achieve by its motion and moulded it in a fashion that will enable what we all want to achieve &ndash; namely, the emergence of the full truth in relation to the allegations, no matter where culpability <Col N="476" />may lie, including the exposure of culpability on the part of State agencies, should that be shown, and the restoration of public confidence in the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system generally.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has begun its work. Its opening statement outlined the extent of the task ahead. The issues raised and the allegations which emerged were, for most of us, astounding. The detail provided in the opening statement shows that the tribunal and its legal team, in a relatively short space of time, have obtained a clear understanding of the issues. Their ability to get such a clear understanding of the sequence of events provides a clear demonstration of their desire to carry out the task in a full and frank manner. The tribunal will not allow itself to be deflected from its task nor will it hesitate in seeking to have the terms of reference altered if it feels in any way constricted or inhibited in its investigations.</P>
    <P>I believe that the citizens of this country are aware that the vast majority of gardaí do an outstanding job for all the people and are deeply grateful to its members. However, there is no doubt that the events in Donegal have caused concern, a concern shared not only by members of the public but also by members of the Garda Síochána. They see that they live and operate in a time of rapid change, when the core values of society are being questioned as never before, when many of our institutions are coming under more rigorous scrutiny than they ever have and the unquestioning attitude which existed in our society for generations towards those in authority is no longer there. They see that the Garda Síochána is not exempt from these developments, that its job has become more difficult and more demanding. They know that in many cases respect for them as gardaí is no longer accorded automatically and in other cases they are treated with great disrespect and disdain. Events such as those in Donegal do not help the Garda win and retain the respect of the people its serves. For these ordinary members of the force, engaged in a difficult job on behalf of the State, it is vital that the tribunal gets to the bottom of what really happened in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the men and women of the Garda Síochána can overcome the difficulties which the force now faces. By being cognisant of the rights and the dignity of each individual they come in contact with and by treating people fairly and impartially I have no doubt they will continue to earn and maintain the trust of the community by performing their duties to the highest standards. In some senses the events in Donegal may act as a watershed. It is clear that for the highest standards of professionalism and integrity to be maintained within the force new structures and procedures are required to be put in place. Principal among these is the Garda inspectorate which the Government has committed itself to introduce and for which legislation is being prepared and should be published in the new year. It is envisaged that this inspectorate will comprise a <Col N="477" />fully independent three-person body which will have its own trained investigation staff and will have extensive powers to investigate independently complaints against members of the force. The inspectorate will be appointed by the Government upon resolution passed by each House and will be required to report to the Oireachtas annually. In addition, a report reviewing the general operation and functions of the inspectorate will be required to be supplied to the Oireachtas every five years.</P>
    <P>It will be open to members of the public to make complaints concerning the conduct of members of the Garda Síochána directly to the inspectorate and complaints may also be referred to it by the Garda Síochána. The inspectorate will have the facility to adopt a flexible approach when dealing with complaints. This will facilitate informal resolution where the matter complained of is not serious and the complainant agrees.</P>
    <P>Serious cases will require formal investigation and the inspectorate will be conferred with the necessary powers to ensure access to relevant evidence and to question the appropriate persons. Following a finding of misconduct by the inspectorate a recommendation for disciplinary action will be passed to the commissioner, together with the reasons for the decision of the inspectorate. Where an investigation discloses a criminal offence the matter will be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The inspectorate will be obliged to automatically conduct an investigation where a person has been killed as a result of Garda action or has died in Garda custody, irrespective of whether a complaint is made in relation to the incident.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment provides that this can happen. It makes clear that the present terms of reference place no limitation on the tribunal in terms of the scope of its investigations. At the same time it provides a clear signal to all those who claim that the terms of reference are not extensive enough and that the way is open and the mechanism exists to extend the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>I commend the placing of this motion before the Dáil in Private Members' time. If I had the gift of Private Members' time I would have put exactly this motion at this time. It is timely and it is essential that it be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is about extending the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal. It is not about what the Garda Síochána did or did not do. Let us not be diverted by the valedictory remarks of members of the Progressive Democrats Party in that regard. The motion seeks to have the terms of reference extended to include the response of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and any other relevant State <Col N="478" />agencies to the allegations that have arisen in the Donegal cases. It is incredible and unprecedented that this is not provided for in the Morris tribunal. It is quite incredible that a Government that supposedly stands for openness and accountability is not prepared to have the most senior officers of the State held to account for the actions of those for whom they are responsible. The most serious allegations have been outlined by the McBrearty family. The reason the tribunal was set up is because it is believed there is substance to those allegations. Why is the Government blustering and bluffing on the issue? It is entirely possible to ask the member of the tribunal to extend the terms of reference. The member has deferred to the will of the Dáil, which set up the tribunal. It can ask the sole member of a tribunal to change its terms and extend them without prejudice to anybody. That is clearly the situation and I ask why the Government is not prepared to do this. Is it attempting to cover up its political failures over the past ten years? Were complaints made to senior Ministers or officials about citizens being subjected to the heavy-handed action of an ongoing campaign of harassment, was nothing done in response to persistent allegations and perhaps even the existence of proof, and is this why the Government does not want the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or other senior officials to go before a tribunal to answer?</P>

Deputies, who might be very hard working, get a fixed amount of money each year &ndash; I take a lot less than most &ndash; and work 12 or 14 hours a day to advance the interests of the people they represent.

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Morris tribunal and on the motion before the House. This motion is about justice and, above all, truth and equality for all the people concerned, especially the victims. Let us not forget the victims, and let us ensure that all sides are treated fairly within the law.</P>
      <P>Many people and families have been hurt and it is up to us as legislators to ensure fair debate, balance and truth. This motion is about terms of reference, not the practices of the Garda. Many of us have worked with the Garda over the years, particularly in disadvantaged communities, and we know they do very good work on the ground. At the same time we must have openness and transparency. That is why I strongly support the motion.</P>
      <P>I also strongly support the McBrearty family regarding the terms of reference and their legal costs. I have talked to the family during the week and gave them a commitment to support them in their quest for truth and justice. It is also important that we send out a strong message that nobody, whatever his or her class or creed, is above the law. Sadly, today in society some people are seen to be more equal than others. Many of us have major concerns that the law has often not been implemented fairly, especially against the poorer sections of society.</P>

    <P>The amendment dealing with the murder of Councillor Eddie Fullerton in Donegal in 1991 should also be supported by all political groupings in this House. To stay silent in these cases is to stay silent on human rights. It is up to all Deputies to ensure the scandals that have happened will not happen again. If we fail we will lose public confidence and all politicians will be seriously damaged in the public mind. This motion is an attempt to use the powers of section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1998, in order <Col N="480" />to widen the terms of reference. I strongly support the motion and urge all Members to support it to ensure fairness, equality and justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a common-sense motion. It is not greatly complicated. There is a precedent for making changes such as this in various other tribunals that have been set up by the House before now. To the average person the law can be a very daunting, intimidating and costly area in which to be engaged. It is incumbent on us as representatives of the people to ensure the law is accessible to all and that it is not put beyond reach of ordinary people. Above all it is important that those at the heart of this tribunal should be adequately taken care of in terms of costs. These costs can be prohibitive particularly in a tribunal such as this. The McBrearty family has been through thick and thin over the years. It is our duty to ensure the family receives adequate protection and representation.</P>
      <P>Over the last few years there has been a sea change in the perception of the Garda Síochána. It is important that we ensure that where there are concerns they are addressed fully and adequately by all. One bad apple has the capacity to infect all of them. There is a crisis in Garda confidence and in the public's perception of the gardaí. It is important that we put those concerns to rest and that we subscribe to the words of Commissioner Staines who said in 1922 that it is not respect for the force of law but the respect of the people that must be earned by the gardaí. This tribunal is trying to do that but it will not be adequate unless those at the heart of it are sufficiently represented.</P>
      <P>My argument is that the McBrearty family has a right to use all the resources available to find out why the gardaí and State authorities initially failed to act on the serious allegations of corruption and intimidation. For that reason the Green Party will support the motion.</P>

      <P>The amendment to the motion in the name of Sinn Féin Deputies centres on the murder of our colleague, Sinn Féin County Councillor Eddie Fullerton, in his home in Buncrana, County Donegal on 25 May 1991. We have put down this amendment because, like Eddie Fullerton's family, to whom we extend our continuing sympathy, we do not believe that a proper investigation into his murder has been carried out by the Garda Síochána. Given the web of corruption in the Garda in Donegal over an extended period of years, and now being exposed daily at the Morris tribunal, we believe their conduct in this case must be thoroughly examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eddie Fullerton was a dear friend of mine and one of the most popular public representatives in the country. We shared an electoral platform as far back as 1984 when we were both European Parliament candidates in Connacht-Ulster. He was highly respected across the political spectrum in his native County Donegal. His energy, honesty and commitment to people drew others to him <Col N="481" />instinctively. The day before Eddie was murdered he was elated because it was officially confirmed that a project he had pioneered as a lone voice for years was finally about to become a reality. The Fullerton-Pollen dam stands as a lasting memorial to a man who believed his community, his county and his country deserved the best.</P>
    <P>There are many unanswered questions about the murder of Eddie Fullerton. Most relevant to the Morris tribunal is the conduct of the Garda investigation, to the extent that there was a Garda investigation at all. Eddie's family points out that on the one hand a comprehensive forensic examination of the scene of the murder was not carried out while on the other, gardaí took away notebooks, cassettes and other material from Eddie's home and car immediately after his death in a manner indicating an investigation of the victim, rather than his killers. The distress of the bereaved Fullerton family was deepened when they discovered this, since gardaí initially denied that any material had been removed. Two official garda bags containing some of Eddie's belongings were eventually returned to the family by gardaí. To this day the family maintains that all of the material has not been returned nor has it been kept informed of the progress of the investigation, if any.</P>
    <P>It is of grave concern that at least one garda, now under scrutiny and facing very serious allegations before the Morris tribunal, was centrally involved in the investigation of the murder of Eddie Fullerton. This is even more alarming when we place it in a wider context. There are strong indications that, like virtually all attacks claimed or carried out by loyalist paramilitaries in this jurisdiction, the murder of Eddie Fullerton could not have been carried out without collusion from British forces. The assassins entered and left the Fullerton home in the early hours of the morning with ease. They were obviously thoroughly familiar with the area and made their getaway without hitch. They certainly had detailed local knowledge. The question that the family and many in the community ask is whether they have local assistance. The Fullerton family deserves the truth. It deserves justice and I urge support for our amendment to extend the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal to address the case.</P>
    <P>I fully support the motion in the name of the Labour Deputies. I commend Deputy Costello for championing the case. The terms of reference must be extended and a fair arrangement on costs should be made with the McBrearty family. Top Garda management, the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be answerable to the tribunal for their response to this massive scandal. The McBrearty family and others deserve nothing less than unhindered access to truth and justice.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Members to support the amendment which is not in conflict with the motion. As no other mechanism offers the Fullerton family a means of having its tragedy, the loss of a husband <Col N="482" />and father, addressed I hope Members support it and support the Labour Party proposal.</P>

      <P>Any Minister should be aware there are dangers in terms of going native. This is a serious issue and past record has shown us that unless strong and firm decisions are made now a great opportunity to find the truth will be lost. What is being asked for is an extension of the terms of reference to include the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>The response of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and any other relevant State agencies to the allegations arising from the foregoing paragraphs and, in particular, the extent to which they exercised the powers and functions available to them fully, properly and in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>This raises the question of why should all these individuals and bodies not be included in the terms of reference.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a serious investigation which questions how society can trust the forces of law and order and the system of Government and how that trust can be safeguarded. The Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister and the Attorney General should all be subjected to the scrutiny of the tribunal. We must remember this is a case in which one man lost his life and others, men and women, found their quality of life ruined and, it would appear, suffered terrible injustice. Such matters deserve full investigation and nobody should be considered above or beyond scrutiny. If this inquiry is not thorough, wide-ranging and conclusive, there will be no closure for those who have been affected and responsibility will not be apportioned to those who are culpable.</P>

    <P>If we have to consider this matter in the light of past experience, there is the obvious example of the Lindsay tribunal which, it was promised, would bring closure to victims and ensure responsibility was laid at the feet of those who were possibly negligent. Because of the inconclusive nature of that report many questions are still unanswered. In that case, 79 haemophiliacs died and many were infected with hepatitis C and <Col N="483" />HIV. When the Lindsay tribunal report was published, it was greeted with some dismay by haemophiliacs because many issues were not resolved. One issue in particular was the investigation of the international drug companies. When the terms of reference of the tribunal were being drawn up, the Irish Haemophilia Society raised the issue with the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and he assured the society, in writing, that the investigation into the international drug companies would be carried out. Reading the terms of reference, we in opposition understood that to be the case.</P>
    <P>When the tribunal began its work, the Irish Haemophilia Society raised the issue with Ms Justice Lindsay because it was concerned it would not be addressed. At the time, it was informed it was too early for it to be dealt with. When the IHS pursued the Minister for Health and Children, who instructed the Attorney General to write to Ms Justice Lindsay, it was informed it was too late. On the one hand it was too early, then it was too late to include this investigation in the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The IHS is still waiting for the investigation and feels that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the then Attorney General, is rubbishing any chance of this investigation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may well now say it is too early to extend the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal and yet may, at a later stage, come to the House to say the judge has determined it is too late. Let us learn from history, otherwise we will repeat those mistakes. I urge the Minster to face up to his responsibilities and ensure that this is not a missed opportunity on such a fundamental issue.</P>

      <P>I join my colleagues in supporting this motion on the Morris tribunal and the McBrearty case. The motion seeks to enable the McBrearty family to participate in the tribunal by dealing with their legal costs. That is reasonable considering the degree to which that family has had to engage in litigation over recent years in relation to these matters. It also seeks to widen the terms of reference so the authorities who are ultimately responsible for the police service and its operation are accountable to the tribunal. It is regrettable the Government has not accepted the motion, that the Minister appears to have been house-trained early in his tenure and has come here to object to the extension of the terms of reference. Even at this late stage, I ask him to reconsider his objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue raises the wider question of how we deal with serious complaints against the Garda. I regret the knee-jerk reaction we get from some spokespersons from the Garda Síochána and representative organs within the force when serious allegations are raised about the performance of individual or groups of gardaí. It is sometimes represented that those who raise such concerns are against the Garda. There is an almost siege <Col N="484" />mentality that emerges from time to time in relation to those complaints. It is important to make it clear that I support the Garda Síochána and I happily have a good working relationship with them in my constituency. I do not subscribe to the idea that every tittle-tattle of a complaint should go the whole distance at the Garda complaints board or that it should be used, as it sometimes is, to frustrate investigations or the pursuit of criminal activity. However, if serious complaints are made, they should be treated seriously. If they are not, the reputation of the Garda comes into question and public confidence in the force is undermined.</P>
    <P>I want to bring a particular case from my own constituency to the Minister's attention about which I have not spoken publicly until now. In July 2001, I was contacted by a mother who told me her adult son, in his early 30s, was severely beaten by members of the Garda Síochána. She showed me photographic evidence of the injuries he suffered. I was separately contacted by another man of a similar age who told me he was severely beaten in the same incident and showed me similar photographic evidence of the injuries he suffered. I advised both men of the procedures open to them for making a complaint. One of the men made a complaint directly to the Garda Síochána and the other complained to the Garda Complaints Board.</P>
    <P>There followed a period of correspondence between myself and the authorities inquiring what was happening with the investigation. Eventually, the man who complained to the Garda received the following reply in July 2002, a year after the incident and the complaint:</P>
    <P>I refer to our meeting in your home in relation to the above complaint. Your complaint was thoroughly investigated, however, the members of the Garda Síochána whom it is alleged assaulted you have not or cannot be conclusively identified. Accordingly, no further action will be taken on the matter.</P>
    <P>The other man who complained to the Garda Complaints Board was interviewed 12 months ago, in November 2001, and has heard nothing since. I will give the Minister some of the photographs with which I was supplied and I will leave it to him to conclude, as he considers the introduction of legislation on a Garda inspectorate &ndash; he knows the Labour Party preference is for the appointment of a Garda ombudsman &ndash; whether, given the nature of the complaint made in this case and the photographic evidence available, that type of response and the length of time it took is satisfactory. I will also leave it to him to consider the individuals concerned, their families, friends, acquaintances and everyone with whom they have had contact in the 17 months since the assaults took place. It does nothing to improve confidence in the Garda and the procedures provided for the investigation of complaints.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment on the incidents that took place. I was not present and I do not know <Col N="485" />what happened &ndash; that is a matter for the inquiry to establish. However, the investigations which have been undertaken in relation to these cases do not satisfy me and I believe they require further consideration. This also underlines the case the Labour Party has made for the appointment of an ombudsman for the Garda Síochána to whom the public can have recourse where there are serious cases of this kind and in whom they can have confidence.</P>

      <P>Various descriptions could be given to the events in Donegal in the mid-1990s.

It simply defies the imagination.</P>

      <P>The butt will come a little later. Although I disagree fundamentally with the Minister on many areas in which he believes passionately, in my opinion he has a high regard for people's fundamental rights. Speaking from personal experience, one may sometimes find oneself in a position of having to defend something which, in a different arena, one would regard as indefensible. This is one such situation where one has to stand outside the ring and look inside to see what is right and proper. The significance of the Morris tribunal and the issues of Garda misconduct which it is investigating cannot be understated. The main stakeholders in this issue are those making claims against gardaí and the State, for which the Garda acts. However, under the terms of reference as currently constituted, there is a prospect that there will be no direct participation in the proceedings by either the Government Minister directly responsible for the Garda or the family at the centre of the allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to ask why a tribunal is proceeding at all if the two main protagonists are not there to present their respective cases in a proper fashion. Failure to include the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the terms of reference of the tribunal, in light of his overall responsibility in relation to the conduct of the Garda, has the potential to ensure that the tribunal will not achieve anything. It is at risk of not being believed if it does not have the ability to reach a conclusion. Whatever conclusion it may reach, the likelihood that it will simply lead to yet another inquiry will mean that the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather <Col N="486" />than the current Minister, will have to be called to answer questions on the matter.</P>
    <P>The decision not to grant legal representation to the McBrearty family should be revisited immediately. While I listened carefully to the statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in that regard, it makes no sense that those who have suffered most in this case should find themselves unable to represent themselves directly and cannot afford legal representation.</P>
    <P>It has emerged that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was receiving regular briefings from the Garda about the behaviour of gardaí in Donegal during the relevant period. The Minister could have acted much earlier but he did not. His reasons for not acting more quickly must undoubtedly be at the heart of this inquiry. There can be no adequate investigation of what happened in Donegal if the Minister's role in the situation is not questioned. It would appear he was being briefed on an almost weekly basis about the activity of a certain number of gardaí in Donegal, but he chose to take no action. That seems incredible. It is also incredible that the person who refused to act, even though he had overall responsibility, will not be asked what happened or why he did not act.</P>
    <P>The Morris tribunal was established because the McBrearty family took a High Court action concerning harassment by gardaí in Donegal. That action had to be abandoned because of events which were exposed during the proceedings. As a result, the High Court case was adjourned and the tribunal established. The failure of the State to provide for the McBrearty family is baffling. They are at the centre of the allegations which form the basis for the inquiry and evidence of serious injustices perpetrated against that family is now in the public domain. It is unthinkable that the tribunal should proceed without their being represented. Resources must be made available to them in advance, as was done in the case of the haemophiliac victims of the BTSB scandal.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, claims of Garda corruption &ndash; whether they relates to the role of the force in Abbeylara or the disgraceful scenes which were recently witnessed in relation to the &ldquo;reclaim the streets&rdquo; protest &ndash; are now commonplace. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reconsider the position with regard to the McBrearty family. If he can step outside the ring and take a more independent view of the situation, I hope he may see matters in a different light.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I have listened carefully to the speakers on both sides of the House in this serious debate, I have yet to hear one cogent argument that could convince any reasonable person there is something lacking in the terms of reference agreed by the House on 28 March 2002 or that there are grounds for extending the terms of reference on <Col N="487" />the lines proposed in the Labour Party motion. Does any Member genuinely believe that the existing terms of reference are such as to prevent the Tribunal from inquiring and making recommendations as to the response of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of Attorney General and other relevant State agencies to the allegations which are the subject of this inquiry? Clearly, the Tribunal does not share that view.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, there is no limitation on the power of the tribunal to investigate anybody or any matter that comes to its notice or to apportion fault in any way. The Tribunal of Inquiries Acts require that an inquiry by a tribunal should be into definite matters of urgent public importance. The reason for such a requirement is plain, namely, that there must be good grounds for establishing a tribunal. It would be an abuse of process to send a tribunal on a fishing expedition, looking for something to investigate. Each of the existing terms of reference relates to a specific allegation or a definite matter on which there are serious questions to answer. If there are specific allegations of malfeasance or gross dereliction of duty against the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General or the Minister, let us hear what they are and what is the supporting evidence for such allegations. In this regard, it is useful to refer to the rulings&mdash;</P>

It is useful to refer to the rulings of the tribunal on the issue. I want the Deputy to hear what the tribunal itself had to say. In its first ruling it was stated that the tribunal&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not give way. I have only a few minutes to reply. I would be happy to give way to the Deputy in any other public forum and I challenge him to a debate in any other public forum.</P>
      <P>In the first ruling it was stated that the tribunal could not possibly adjudicate on an application to extend its terms of reference because no material has been advanced for an extension of the terms of reference being sought. The tribunal went on to point out, if arguments or submissions are made, particularly those grounded on evidence, it will then consider its attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its second, more recent, ruling where the issue was again considered, the tribunal indicated <Col N="488" />that it would consider submissions to extend its terms of reference. However, it went on to say that &ldquo;A mere assertion or request for an extension of the terms of reference is not sufficient.&rdquo;  The tribunal also stated that:</P>
    <P>For the moment I do not think it appropriate to act on Mr. Frank McBrearty's assertion because I believe it too general in its nature and scope and premature in its timing. Mr. Frank McBrearty Senior, or anyone acting on his behalf, may, at any time, renew this application in accordance with the procedures I have indicated.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear last night that he remained open to extending the terms of reference if it transpires that there is a need to do so. That is crystal clear on the last paragraph of the Government amendment.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has already demonstrated its ability and commitment to engage in the challenging tasks that have been entrusted to it by this House. If we are to get to bottom of the Donegal affair and restore confidence in the Garda Síochána quickly, and it is of paramount importance that we do, we need to support the tribunal in its work. There seems to be some misunderstanding about the nature of a tribunal. Deputy Rabbitte last night talked about the &ldquo;average citizen&rdquo; being pitted against the State in the context of costs. Let us be clear. The tribunal was established by this House and will report back to this House. It is independent and it alone is charged with inquiring into the grave matters set out in its terms of reference. In that regard it has the assistance of a number of counsel and investigators. The tribunal is an inquisitorial process. It is nothing like the adversarial process of a court where you have two opposing sides with a judge or jury in the middle. The persons or organisations who appear before the tribunal do so as witnesses, not as plaintive or defendant. The sole purpose of legal representation of these witnesses is to defend the interest of their clients.</P>
    <P>On behalf of all tribunals, I vigorously reject any suggestion that lack of legal representation for a particular witness will undermine the ability of the tribunal to do its job. As the Minister explained last night, the existing law provides that the legal costs of all parties can be met after the tribunal has made its findings, provided they have co-operated with the tribunal. Equity requires that all parties to the tribunal be treated equally. To seek to guarantee the costs of one party in advance would not only run counter to this maxim of equity but it would pre-empt the findings of the tribunal and remove perhaps its greatest power in its search for the truth, the power to grant or refuse costs.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I must respond to two issues which arose last night. Inferences were made that the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform acted improperly in some way in communicating to the Garda certain allegations that had been made to Deputy Howlin and then <Col N="489" />Deputy Jim Higgins. On 26 June 2000 one of the Deputies contacted the Minister and a meeting was arranged the next day with both Deputies. A document relating to the allegations was passed to the Minister. The allegations were against senior members of the Garda. They were serious and, if true, would constitute criminal behaviour. The next day the Minister met with the Garda Commissioner and gave him the document so that the allegations could be investigated. Both Deputies were informed of this and neither Deputy objected. Indeed, they would have grounds for objection if allegations had not been immediately investigated.</P>
    <P>The other issue I wish to touch on briefly is the allegation that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has never given a proper explanation as to why an exhumation order was not proceeded with in the Barron case. Detailed statements have been made to the Dáil on this matter on more than one occasion. The facts are that in 1997 a particular garda officer sought an exhumation order in respect of the body of Mr. Baron through the coroner for County Donegal. A draft exhumation order was drawn up but was not proceeded with because the garda officer in question contacted the Department and asked that the request be put on hold until further notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Costello, for advancing this motion and the members of the other Opposition parties and Independent Deputies who decided to support it. I want to start by saying that, in the heat of battle this morning, I made some reference along the lines that the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform came into the House last night to make fun of the McBrearty family. I am sorry I made that remark and I withdraw it. It was not intended in that sense.</P>
      <P>Having examined what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did say and having examined the amendment to the motion that he has brought forward, I have to say that I believe his position is disingenuous. The amendment is worthless from the point of view of the objective of the McBrearty family.</P>
      <P>I made the remark this morning because I was annoyed at the statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the Labour Party was playing politics with this issue. What could be more serious than the apparent unlawful killing of a citizen and the framing of another citizen on a murder charge? I cannot think of anything more serious. The fact that it was done at the hands of the gardaí makes it more serious, if that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that the Labour Party advanced this motion is that the McBrearty family feel they cannot make themselves amenable to the tribunal. They cannot become involved in it because they have already been so oppressed by the State and it has cost them so much money that they are not able to proceed. More importantly, as Deputy <Col N="490" />Costello outlined, critical people who ought to be made amenable to the tribunal are not expressly included in the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that if something falls out of the sky the terms of reference can be altered to include, for example, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As it stands at the moment there is little prospect of that happening and the more one looks at the documents the more one concludes that the exclusion of the former Minister is deliberate. It is interesting, when you look at the amendment, that it starts with 28 March 2002. There is no reference to what transpired before then, to the years of inaction when the gravimen of the allegations was in the possession of the Minister. No action was taken. We are supposed to start from 28 March.</P>
    <P>I only came in at the end of the Minister's speech last night but, when you read it you find that the entire case being made by the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that the tribunal is fine because it was born out of an independent review by a senior counsel appointed for that purpose who, having examined all of the papers and heard all of the evidence, came up with this recommendation and all that the Minister's predecessor did was to implement it. That does not accord with the facts. The Minister talks about Shane Murphy, a nominee of the Bar Council, not chosen by the Department to conduct and independent review. Then, as the Minister continued to argue before Deputy Howlin interrupted, the terms of reference put to the House were those which were suggested to his predecessor by an independent and, as his friends put it earlier in the debate, an eminent senior counsel not chosen by his predecessor. The Minister goes on to explain how Mr. Murphy had the advantage over nearly everyone in the House of having seen the documentation available to the various organs of the State. What the Minister did not say was that Mr. Shane Murphy had no access to the McBrearty family or any documents they had.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a letter sent on 7 November 2002 by solicitors acting on behalf of the McBrearty family. It reminded the Minister that he and his predecessor were aware that the only documentation seen by Mr. Murphy was that which was in the State's possession. It also pointed out that no documentation in the hands of their clients had been furnished to Mr. Murphy and that their clients had no opportunity to address him on this issue. The letter further stated that the terms of reference suggested by Mr. Murphy were entirely defined by the documentation which he was allowed to see. It then stated that if Mr. Murphy had been given a comprehensive brief, there would be no doubt that the suggested terms of reference would have included an examination of the role of the State as well.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Howlin said, it is unprecedented in circumstances such as this that the parent Department, in this case the Department of Justice, <Col N="491" />Equality and Law Reform, would not be expressly cited in the terms of reference. Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister who presided over the Department, chose to ignore all pleas from the McBrearty family down through the years. He refused to give any heed to their complaints and escaped scot free. He came into the House and devised terms of reference that contrived to exclude him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner is also not included.</P>
      <P>I met a colleague in the corridor last night who said, &ldquo;Fair play to McDowell, he has come up with an amendment that looks like it will open the door.&rdquo;  I said that it was great news and that I would expect no less from the eminent Minister. When I read the amendment, however, I found that it does not open the door at all. The amendment includes a reference to the resolution passed by the Dáil on 28 March 2002, as we all know. It then states that the terms of reference are, &ldquo;based upon the recommendations of an independent review conducted by Mr. Shane Murphy S.C.&rdquo;, but we now know that Mr. Murphy was in contact with the State side of the argument only. He did not have access to the McBrearty family, he was not briefed by them and he did not seek to talk to them. I was pleased to see that the amendment stipulated that, &ldquo;the terms of reference place no limitation on the Tribunal&rdquo;, but a closer reading revealed that this related only to, &ldquo;the scope of any findings or recommendations it may make.&rdquo;  It is little comfort to those involved, as it has nothing to do with the issue before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment declares that the tribunal, &ldquo;has expressed itself open to arguments or submissions based on evidence on the desirability of seeking an amendment of the terms of reference.&rdquo;  A game of pass the parcel was played. Mr. Justice Morris asked how he could agree to amend the terms of reference, given that the Dáil rejected an amendment of broadly similar substance when it originally discussed the Bill which set up the tribunal. He said that he thinks it would be impertinent of him to intervene at this stage to say that the terms of reference should be altered. When the Taoiseach was asked about the matter, he said he knew that the tribunal could approach him and that he would respond to any such approach. It is clear, as a consequence of the game of pass the parcel between the tribunal and the Taoiseach, that the issue is being avoided. The game is also being played by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, who said that he may act if something transpires. Anyone who took an interest in the Abbeylara inquiry and observed how the Garda tends to muster in these circumstances, but who believes nonetheless that something will transpire, perhaps by falling from the <Col N="492" />sky, to cause the terms of reference to be altered, is naive.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the Labour Party's motion concludes by saying that the Minister will, &ldquo;keep under review the need for such consultation in the light of developing circumstances.&rdquo;  Such a statement, with respect to the Minister who moved the amendment, is of no more value then the commitment that allowed haemophiliacs to be sucked into the Lindsay tribunal. Deputies will remember that haemophiliacs were told, at first, that it was too early to take on board the point they were making about the drugs companies, but that they should raise it at a later date. When they mentioned it later, they were told that it was too late to do so as the tribunal was about to conclude its deliberations. The same type of commitment is being made to the McBrearty family: that something may develop to cause the terms of reference to be changed, but otherwise the Government stands over the exclusion of the family.</P>
    <P>I would not have a problem with the latter part of the Government's amendment if there was any basis for believing that the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is likely to be brought before the Morris tribunal to answer for his stewardship. If one looks at the tribunal's opening statement, one will notice that there is no module that entertains the prospect of Deputy O'Donoghue being brought before the tribunal. Express provision is, however, made for chasing the whistle-blower. It is quite amazing that the tribunal's opening statement says that it will, &ldquo;be necessary to ascertain the identity of this person and to seek his/her assistance for the work of the Tribunal.&rdquo;  This means that the allegers are being asked to bring home their allegations. Why is there an obsession with who put Deputy Howlin and former Deputy Jim Higgins in possession of the disturbing information in the first instance?</P>
    <P>It is especially remarkable given what was said by the Assistant Garda Commissioner, Mr. Carty, when the tribunal opened in Donegal. His comments represented an outrageous denigration of two Members of the Oireachtas. He said that they used &ndash; and he selected a careful formula of words &ndash;&ldquo;whatever privileges were available to them&rdquo; to slander his character. They did nothing of the kind.</P>

      <P>The late Mr. Justice Hamilton was a nice man. I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform remembers that the allegers had to bring home their thorny allegations when it suited the judge. If they did not do so, he ring-fenced political donations by saying they were normal and decided that he would not investigate them further. He found that Members of this House were not only entitled not to disclose the identity of citizens who put them in possession of information that may be in the public interest or of concern, but that they had a duty not to do so. Apparently, we are departing from Mr. Justice Hamilton's finding now.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of grave concern that, in the dying days of the last Dáil, the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 2002, was published on a Wednesday and guillotined on the Friday. On the eve of a general election, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, managed to escape. The Garda Commissioner and the Donegal State Solicitor are not expressly mentioned in the terms of reference either. My party has been accused by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, of playing politics in seeking to revisit the legislation. He had an incredible backup audience in his Progressive Democrats colleagues. I have not seen so many Deputies from that party in the House for 12 or 13 years. Perhaps the former Attorney General should have been expressly mentioned in the terms of reference, as the normally independent Deputy Fiona O'Malley and others were whipped into line tonight. One would imagine that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, would have some floods to attend to, but, like his party colleagues, he has been brought in to defend Deputy McDowell in case he might be asked why, as Attorney General, he assented to such leaky terms of reference.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about the question of legal costs. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has advanced the argument that it would be invidious for him to choose between persons who might be called before the Morris tribunal. He said that if he provided a guarantee of legal costs for the McBrearty family, he would have to do likewise for others. I remind him, however, that such a distinction was made in the case of the Lindsay tribunal. The Minister argued last night that the haemophiliacs in that case deserved special measures as they were a charity case. Does that mean that the McBrearty family should set itself up as a charity?</P>

      <P>In the state of impecuniosity to which they have been reduced, access to justice has been denied them because of want of money. If money could be advanced for the haemophiliacs, I cannot see how the Minister could come in and dismiss it with a wave of his hand as something he calls a non-precedent. There is a precedent. The Minister is correct to address, as the website of <i>The Irish Times</i> states tonight, the question of the efficacy and suitability of tribunals of inquiry for this kind of thing. He seems to have changes in mind, and they may be good and appropriate, but we are stuck with the here and now for this tribunal. The McBreartys are not like others. Who else is in the same position as the McBreartys? They are the victims, yet the Minister compares them to the Garda. Every single garda has the protection of his trade union or of the State and they are paid by the State. They are under the protection of the Garda Representative Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue. I should begin by saying I live in Blackpool and over the past two weeks I have seen not just business people <Col N="499" />but my neighbours completely devastated by what can only be considered volumes of water that have never before been seen in the area. A businessman from Blackpool told me that the last time he saw flooding of this nature, even though not quite as bad, was in 1964. Last week there was a flood which in the case of one business wiped out almost &euro;250,000 worth of stock and equipment. In the case of individuals living in the area, the water simply came in the front door and washed out the back door. One house with all electrical utilities was completely wiped out. This particular lady has four very young children.</P>
      <P>Blackpool is a very old area of Cork. It is one of the four villages that rings the city and it has a very elderly population. As well as calling on the Minister to extend humanitarian aid to the Blackpool area and all other areas flooded in the city, we must now investigate what exactly caused the flooding. There has been massive development in the Blackpool area. A field known as the Tan Field and Tuckers Field, which were always flooded and considered a flood plain, are now entirely built on. I wonder has this contributed in a significant way to the volumes of water recently witnessed in the Blackpool area. Manholes were shot into the air by the force of the water. One could say this is as a result of the heavy rainfall, but Cork has never been a particularly dry place. I recall at one stage that it was called the Venice of the south. I do not know why because there were no gondolas. While the rainfall witnessed has been above average, it does not explain entirely the flooding that has taken place.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that humanitarian aid is made available in the short-term to ensure people are allowed some quality of life in the run-up to Christmas, which is just three weeks away. I appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to make aid available as quickly as possible. In the long-term some investigation must take place to ensure flooding does not occur again. It is my great fear this will recur if something is not done about it.</P>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to bring this matter before the House. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, for allowing the humanitarian aid to be extended. I plead with him to ensure this is done in a very speedy fashion. As it is just three weeks from Christmas people cannot afford to wait long. These people are devastated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon) Tom Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I express my sympathy and that of the Government to all those affected by flooding in Cork city and elsewhere. As the House will be aware, there have been a number of flooding incidents throughout the country in the past three weeks. As a result of the severe flooding, the Government approved an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme of humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship arising out of the flooding of people's homes on the basis that the Exchequer would <Col N="500" />meet the cost from within the existing budget for 2002.</P>
      <P>Following the flooding in Cork city today which affected approximately 60 homes and 30 business premises, I had discussions with the Taoiseach about the urgent need to extend the humanitarian aid scheme to the Cork area. He was in total agreement with me in treating this issue as a priority. I announced today that the scheme will be extended to flood victims in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>The Irish Red Cross Society will administer the scheme in Cork and it will be advertised in the national newspapers and on national and local radio. Application forms will be available by ringing the Freefone number provided or they can be obtained from the Irish Red Cross Society's website, www.redcross.ie/irishfloods. The closing date for receipt of applications is Friday, 13 December 2002 &ndash; I hope this is not ominous for the scheme. The scheme is being administered on a confidential basis by the Irish Red Cross Society and I emphasise it is designed to provide humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship arising from the damage to people's homes and not compensation for losses. The Irish Red Cross Society has a lot of experience in administering such schemes as we already administered &euro;8.5 million in the Dublin area in February as a result of floods.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my sympathy and concern for the victims of flooding and I hope the measures introduced today will help to relieve the hardship experienced by those affected by the flooding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue of public private partnerships. I previously asked whether there is an embargo by the Department of Finance on PPPs and whether some people in the Department are blocking the progress of these projects. One of the examples I gave &ndash; I am glad to have the opportunity to put it to the Minister &ndash; was the Cork School of Music. The school is a dilapidated product of the 1950s or 1960s and needs to be replaced. In June 1999 the then Minister for Education and Science said that a new school of music would be built in Cork. I understand that, under the PPP process, three companies were invited to bid and in April 2001 the preferred bidder was announced. To date no decision to proceed with the project has been taken even though the Department of Finance was represented on the vetting committee. In the expectation that everything was in order, the academic and administrative staff and students vacated the building last year. They now occupy space in a hotel in Cork city and about 15 other venues throughout the city, and there is resultant mayhem and disorganisation caused by this multi-centred activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is this public private partnership on ice? Why has the Department of Finance not given it the go-ahead? Cork is to be the European City <Col N="501" />of Culture in 2005. It could be without a school of music and a centre for the performing arts in dance, spoken arts and music unless the project is given the go-ahead immediately. The developer can begin work in January. It is a two year project so the building would be ready just in time for the European City of Culture event. A decision is needed urgently and the students deserve a favourable decision because the School of Music, despite its lack of resources and shortcomings, has contributed hugely to the musical life of the city. I declare a vested interest in that my three girls attended the school and have come out of it with the gift of being able to play instruments, something I regret not having. The Minister would do a good day's work if he announced the go-ahead tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding this matter. As the Deputy will be aware, the new Cork School of Music, a constituent part of Cork Institute of Technology, is being procured under the public private partnership model. The Cork School of Music provides training in a wide range of musical instruments, music theory and speech and drama. The school caters for first, second, third and fourth level students, whether they are amateur musicians, music teachers or performers.</P>
      <P>Following a project launch in July 2000, 12 consortia expressed interest in bidding for the project. Following the presentation of outline proposals the number of bidders was eventually reduced to three. These bidders were issued with an invitation to negotiate in November 2000. Final bids were submitted in February 2001 and were subject to detailed evaluation under the four headings of design and technical, financial, legal and operation. The evaluation was undertaken by a project board established to oversee the procurement process and consisted of officials of the Departments of Education and Science and Finance together with specialist advisors appointed to support the process.</P>
      <P>Following the evaluation of the bids, Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder in March 2001. The initial advertised tender for the project was for the refurbishment and rebuild of the school and the provision of a range of facilities management to include building maintenance, cleaning, security, grounds maintenance and specialist equipment support by way of a public private partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the bidding process, the project scope changed substantially with all three bidders independently coming to the same conclusion that a complete new building was the most appropriate solution and that the current building should not be retained. Following the granting of full planning permission by Cork Corporation &ndash; now Cork City Council &ndash; an appeal was lodged to An Bord Pleanála. During the appeal process, it was not possible to progress the detailed financial, legal and operational issues until a definitive <Col N="502" />answer to the appeal was announced. This was because the original bid was costed in respect of the operation and service elements based on the design approved. Any major changes to the design because of the appeal could have had serious consequences for the operator in providing the services as outlined in their bid. An Bord Pleanála rejected the appeal on 24 December 2001.</P>
    <P>It is therefore incorrect for the Deputy to state that the project was waiting to proceed from January this year. Following the rejection of the appeal, the Department of Education and Science was only in a position to commence the detailed contract negotiations with the preferred bidder. The present position is that my officials are having discussions with the European Investment Bank regarding its participation. That would provide for the refinancing of the project two years into the operations phase, thus reducing the overall cost. A similar arrangement with the EIB is about to be signed for the post-primary schools PPP project.</P>
    <P>As with the schools bundle of PPP projects, the last of which are in the process of being handed over to the Department of Education and Science, final approval for the Cork School of Music will be based on an assessment of the affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the available capital funding envelope. The Minister expects to be in a position to communicate with the Cork Institute of Technology regarding the Cork School of Music project in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to take this matter. It is important to state that, if a cancer is detected early and appropriately treated, in approximately 90% of cases it can be cured.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Limerick General Hospital is one of the 13 centres of excellence identified by the National Cancer Forum for the treatment of breast cancer. Approximately &euro;1 million has been provided but the total cost of having the centre of excellence fully staffed will be &euro;5 million. The presence of such a centre provides women with symptoms of breast cancer with the best appropriate care in a holistic atmosphere. The team of specialists recommended includes a lead consultant, a breast surgeon and support team, breast care nurse specialists, a pathologist, a radiologist, a medical oncologist and radiographers who specialise in mammography. An important aspect is that the team works together and, as this is their specialist area, the level of expertise is high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of the resources is required to fully set up the centre in Limerick. The Minister will be aware that the clinical oncologist in Limerick, Dr. Gupta, has achieved much to date. I will not be churlish in acknowledging what has been achieved but much remains to be done. This issue <Col N="503" />was discussed for more than an hour at the last Mid-Western Health Board meeting and involved medical specialists, including Dr. Gupta and a variety of people from the board. There was a strong view that this matter be brought to the Minister with a view to getting the funding to set up the centre of excellence as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The extension of BreastCheck to the rest of the country is important as it not included for the Limerick area. I would like to see that rolled out as soon as possible, something I am sure the Minister supports. I understand that it is likely the mammographies in the mid-west will be carried out in Cork and Galway. The Minister may correct me on that but that was the impression at the board meeting. Where a woman needs treatment she should be referred back to her own region rather than being kept in either Cork or Galway. Radiotherapy has been a live political issue and I know the Minister is expecting a report soon.</P>

      <P>As one of the major regions not supplied with radiotherapy facilities, I ask that the mid-west be considered for inclusion when decisions are made. Where medical experts suggest radiotherapy as the most appropriate treatment for a patient, it has been shown in many cases that because it is not accessible in the local region patients choose a different treatment.</P>
      <P>In what has been achieved so far, the centre of excellence that has begun in Limerick is probably one of the best in the country. The level of determination and commitment shown by Dr. Gupta and his staff is second to none. This project is ready to go if it can get the funding and resources. It is a matter of being told the additional staff can be recruited and the work can continue. I urge the Minister to provide the necessary funding to fully develop the centre of excellence in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment of the House and for giving me this opportunity to set out the current position in relation to the development of breast cancer services generally and in the Mid-Western Health Board area in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 2000, the Mid-Western Health Board formally adopted a report on the development of symptomatic breast disease services for the region. The board has agreed to develop its symptomatic services at Limerick Regional Hospital. Referral to the breast clinic at Limerick Regional Hospital allows rapid access to a consultant surgeon, mammography and rapid processing of results. All relevant members of the team attend weekly multi-disciplinary meetings. Financial approval has recently issued to the Mid-Western Health Board for the appointment of a general surgeon with a special interest in breast surgery. In addition, two breast care nurses have been appointed to Limerick Regional Hospital. <Col N="504" />The new oncology unit at the hospital is a model of good planning and recognises patient needs as the main priority. Additional resources will be made available to the board in 2003 to continue to meet oncology demands in the region.</P>
    <P>I met Dr. Gupta a year ago and was very impressed with his plans and the degree to which he had secured the agreement of people across the region. Coming to such an agreement has dogged other regions, but he has managed to convince people of the merits of the centre and has engaged them in the correct fashion. I secured additional funding for 2002 and I hope to be of assistance again next year.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, over &euro;103 million has been invested in the development of services, well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in the national cancer strategy 1996. I think it is working well and because of the likes of Dr. Gupta and others coming into the service, the quality of treatment is now much better. An additional sum of &euro;29 million is being allocated in 2003 for cancer services. This will enable us to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services. We realise that we have established a number of centres that have full-year costings and development needs.</P>
    <P>Since 1996, approval has issued for 80 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology. This includes approval for 13 new consultant posts with a special interest in breast disease. People often wonder where the money has gone but these additional posts demonstrate the increased focus on quality, which we never had before, in our cancer services. This investment is a major element of the implementation of the recommendations of the O'Higgins report on symptomatic breast disease. We have invested considerably in this programme and further investment will be made.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced screening in March 2000, with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme be driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nationwide, to which I am committed. To the end of August this year, almost 92,000 women had been called for screening and more than 68,000 women had been screened, representing an uptake of 74%.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to expand the programme but the BreastCheck board believes that anyone screened within the screening centres should be treated there. If we are establishing centres of <Col N="505" />excellence, it does not make sense to have women bypass their own centre to go to Cork or Galway. This is what has come forward from BreastCheck. It has its views about the continuation of quality services and standards and wants to oversee that. The Department will hold meetings with BreastCheck to discuss this issue with a view to the best utilisation of financial resources. There must be a synergy between the development of centres of excellence and the facilities of the BreastCheck board. The Cancer Forum is formulating a new cancer strategy.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Control of Dogs Act.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Cheann Comhairle as cead a thabhairt dom an t-ábhar seo a árdú anocht. From time to time I am horrified to hear from constituents and dog wardens about the inadequacies of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986. For example, section 19 of the Act states that the Minister may make regulations for premises holding more than five dogs over four months old. Dog wardens constantly point out that the regulations covering the holding of ten or more dogs are inadequate given that it only takes one mistreated or violent dog to severely maim or kill a person.</P>
      <P>I refer to a letter I recently received from a female constituent. Her husband, whose right arm was amputated, was attacked by two bull mastiffs belonging to a neighbour. In regard to the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, she recommends that a special licence be required for ownership of the breeds that need to be muzzled when in public and that the facilities in which these dogs must be kept be inspected and approved by the relevant authorities before the licence is granted, and that that apply annually. She was thankful that the dogs did not attack her children and that her husband was not alone when this attack occurred. Having witnessed the attack, she does not want another family to have to go through the anguish of wondering whether a victim's arms can be saved or of seeing the disfigurement of a face with swelling, stitches etc. She said her husband is a strong man but he was thrown around and dragged like a rag doll by these animals.</P>
      <P>Ironically, an anomaly exists in that the fine for walking a dangerous dog without a lead is &euro;30 whereas there is a &euro;125 on-the-spot fine for the owner of a dog fouling a public place. It is important we address the growing problem of dangerous dogs that are seen by their owners as guard dogs rather than pets.</P>
      <P>Any dog warden will tell the Minister that they live not knowing how they will cope with the violence they encounter. I heard of a dog warden who was called to a house to take away a Staffordshire bull terrier. When he arrived 13 such terriers appeared and he could restrain only one with the standard issue restraining pole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many examples of horrific attacks, such as the one in Whitestown in Blanchardstown where a German shepherd dog viciously savaged <Col N="506" />a 15 year old boy. Other breeds, like springer spaniels, are not in the dangerous category but have carried out horrific attacks on young children.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need to update legislation, otherwise no one will be prepared to work as a dog warden. The laws in Britain are much stiffer and in the USA dog wardens may prosecute on the spot. The updating of our law must be done in consultation with the dog wardens, the various welfare organisations and local authorities. Failure to consult has led to flawed by-laws. I refer here, for example, to the by-law under which areas are sectioned off for exercising dogs. A small well trained dog is likely to be savaged if a dangerous dog is released in the same section.</P>
    <P>Wardens strongly recommend that the law should be changed to allow a judge to order that a dog should be muzzled if it is found to be dangerous. At present, a judge can either release the dog or have it put down. Owners naturally plead for the life of their dogs, even if they are dangerous. That happened in the case of a springer spaniel. A basic requirement is that microchips should be attached to all dogs so that an owner can be traced if an animal becomes lost and held to account if it attacks any person or other animals.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as the DSPCA and the ISPCA carry out onerous and invaluable work on everyone's behalf. In thanking them for their voluntary efforts, I appeal to the Government to recognise that there are more calls on their time and resources than they can handle. They need to be provided with realistic levels of Government resources and facilities. As Mahatma Gandhi said, the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way it treats its animals.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to aspire to some level of greatness and to amend the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, in consultation with the dog wardens who despair at the day to day trauma and violence they encounter, which is growing steadily worse. Security and insurance issues are becoming more serious. People are purchasing dangerous dogs because they want to protect their homes, but they are not caring for those animals properly. I ask the Minister of State to intervene and to consult the dog wardens before there are any more horrific injuries and perhaps deaths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sargent for raising this matter. I will outline the legislative background in relation to dog control. Problems associated with dog control, including attacks referred to by the Deputy and losses of livestock caused by marauding dogs, led to the passing of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986. The Act gave county and city councils extensive dog control powers. The Control of Dogs Act, 1992, which came into operation four years ago, amended and extended the earlier Act, but its primary purpose was to address the question of dangerous dogs. The Act makes wide <Col N="507" />powers available to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make regulations governing the keeping of dangerous dogs. The Act also provides for higher fines and longer imprisonment for offences, as well as for wider use of on-the-spot fines.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework the Oireachtas has put in place for the control of dogs is comprehensive. The principal features of the system now in place involve local authorities or, in some cases, the ISPCA acting on their behalf discharging dog control functions, including appointing dog wardens, operating shelters for stray or unwanted dogs, seizing stray dogs and arranging for the destruction of dogs that are not reclaimed or for which new homes cannot be found. Dog control legislation also imposes requirements on the owner or other persons in charge of a dog not to permit the dog to be in any place other than the premises of the owner or other person whose consent has been obtained. In any other place, the dog must be accompanied and kept under effectual control.</P>
      <P>As regards dangerous dogs, the Control of Dogs Regulations, 1998, prescribe leashing and muzzling requirements in respect of ten breeds of dogs. These requirements must be observed when the dog is in a public place and the person in charge of the dog must be over 16 years of age and must be capable of controlling the dog. Furthermore, the 1986 Act gives specific powers to the courts to order that a dog, which the court considers to be dangerous, shall be kept under proper control or be destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enabling legislation also allows the Minister to make provision for systems of identification, including microchipping. An identification system is already a statutory requirement on foot of the Control of Dogs Regulations, 1998. These regulations require the owner or other person in charge of a dog to ensure that the dog shall at all times wear a collar bearing the name and address of the owner inscribed thereon on a plate, badge or disc attached thereto. The regulations contain penalties for non-compliance with this require<Col N="508" />ment or for defacing or rendering illegible the particulars described above.</P>
    <P>Against this background. it seems that the relatively significant costs which would accompany the introduction of any obligatory system of microchipping would not be commensurate with the benefits to be realised from such a system.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, which is before the House, contains a provision that will allow a court to specify, on the making of a closure order in respect of a premises such as a nightclub, that prior to the annual renewal of a licence or registration applicable to that premises, certain requirements would have to be fulfilled including, for example, the installation of a CCTV system. The Bill provides, in addition, that the court may also consider imposing restrictions on the type of substances which may be sold in the premises or placing limits on the number of persons who may be admitted. I believe that is the best way to ensure that owners of these and other premises covered by the Bill meet their responsibilities in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The prison service has for a number of years been operating with what is, in any view, an extraordinary level of dependence on overtime. In 2001, the cost of overtime was nearly 30% of the overall pay costs for the service. This overtime requirement arises because the level of staff serving is inadequate to meet the 24 hour, seven day week needs of the service based on existing agreed staffing arrangements. In particular it has been necessary to resort to overtime working to cover prisoner escorts, staff leave, staff training, sick absence and staff shortfalls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it has been my stated aim to decisively address the issue of <Col N="510" />unacceptable overtime costs in the Prisons Service. In meetings which I have had with both the management of the Irish Prison Service and with the national officers of the Prison Officers Association, the union which represents the majority of prison staff, I have made it clear that I consider this issue to be a priority for my Department. I have made it known to all concerned that I am determined to see it addressed in the very short rather than the long-term. At my request officials of the Irish Prison Service, who have been long engaged in a detailed exploration of alternative working arrangements for the management of prisons and places of detention, are putting together a draft package or framework of proposals for such change on which to consult the staff side.</P>
    <P>The preparation of this new system of prison working has been greatly facilitated by the detailed prison by prison recommendations on more efficient prison staffing by an expert management group, the staffing and operations review team &ndash; SORT &ndash; which completed its work last year. Since then, management has engaged in a lengthy consultative process with staff representatives with a view to ensuring that the SORT recommendations could be implemented without the need for overtime working. These consultations recently reached the stage where management found itself in a position to draw together a new framework to implement the SORT recommendations and at the same time to tackle the service's dependency on overtime working.</P>
    <P>This process has been both lengthy and complex but is being afforded a very high level of priority by my officials, the management of the Irish Prison Service and me. It is the intention that realistic proposals for change in the short-term will be tabled in a matter of weeks and discussed urgently with staff representatives with a view to the necessary staffing reforms being agreed early in the New Year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>A central focus of this report is on the barriers to reintegration and the need for targeted and coherent mechanisms to ensure that prisoners can be more effectively integrated back into the community. The report's overall conclusion is that what are required are key institutional mechanisms and models to spearhead and ensure effective follow through on the report's recommendations. Priority is being given to developing these mechanisms. A high level co-ordination group on prisoner reintegration has <Col N="511" />been established and is chaired by an assistant secretary from my Department. This group is composed of senior officials from the various Departments and statutory agencies who are identified in the report as having a role to play in progressing its implementation. This reflects the fact that, as the report makes clear, it is not only my Department but its associated agencies that will have a significant role in this regard. The group will also be drawing on the expertise of the many community and voluntary groups that have experience of dealing with the issues raised by the report. The group is currently examining the areas for action highlighted in the report and will oversee the implementation of the appropriate recommendations.</P>
      <P>The elaboration of positive sentence management as a mechanism for effective integration and co-ordination of all services and programmes designed to meet the complex and diverse needs of offenders, is a key task for the Prison Service. Important aspects of this task are building alliances and partnerships with the wider community and development of a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of drug treatment, education, vocational training and multidisciplinary programmes &ndash; including offender behaviour programmes. The appointment of a director of regimes in the Prison Service has been an important step in this process and will provide an administrative driver for this task. It is intended to establish, in the very near future, a working group on positive sentence management within the prison service comprising all the relevant agencies and bodies. This working group will be mindful of best practice in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>Interagency working, the multidisciplinary team approach and the elaboration of positive sentence management are each concepts with which my Department, the Irish Prisons Service and the probation and welfare service are already fully familiar. The Prisons Service's strategy statement, 2001 to 2003, which was launched in October 2001, sets forth in some detail the strategic work programme on which the service has already embarked to dovetail these concepts into the daily workings of the service and each individual institution. Many of the actions highlighted by the NESF report had previously been identified by both the Irish Prisons Service and the probation and welfare service, and work on implementing them has been progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most noteworthy of these is the homeless offenders strategy team &ndash; HOST &ndash; a multiagency accommodation directorate which has recently been established, with the probation and welfare service as the lead agency and an assistant principal probation and welfare officer as director of the unit. The team has a national remit in relation to both offenders under probation and welfare service supervision in the community as well as those in custody and provides a focus for identifying and redressing pathways into homelessness associated with offending and imprison<Col N="512" />ment. Dublin City Council has already seconded one staff member to work on a full-time basis with the team.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment, the strategy team has set about enhancing existing contact and liaison with the voluntary and community sector, in particular with organisations concerned with the provision of accommodation and related supports and services to prisoners and ex-prisoners. It is an overall aim of my Department to provide and maintain a secure, efficient and progressive system of containment and rehabilitation for offenders. The National Economic and Social Forum report provides a timely and well researched contribution to the development of this policy aim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998, following representations to the Taoiseach by CORI &ndash; Conference of the Religious of Ireland &ndash; and members of the main Traveller organisations, the Government allocated a sum of £900,000 to fund a Traveller communications programme over a three year period from 1999 to 2001. The objective of the programme was to address the underlying causes of mistrust between Travellers and the settled community and to promote a greater understanding between both communities. The Traveller communication strategy, Citizen Traveller, completed its three year programme at the end of 2001. Following representations, it was decided to provide funding for a further year. The agreed allocation for 2002 was &euro;380,000.</P>
      <P>In June 2002, a commitment was made in An Agreed Programme for Government &ldquo;to review campaigns designed to promote tolerance and understanding between the settled and travelling communities and maintain multi-annual funding for targeted programmes&rdquo;. This summer, the campaign had incurred expenditure on a campaign which went outside its terms of reference. In September 2002, I requested a review of the Citizen Traveller campaign with the following terms of reference: to undertake a value for money audit of the Citizen Traveller campaign; to undertake a review of the decision making and management processes; to prepare an up to date report on the financial position of the Traveller Communication Committee Ltd.; and to provide recommendations for future action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review which was carried out by an independent management consultant concluded that: the campaign did not fully embrace the objectives behind the campaign; with the increasing allocation of Citizen Traveller funds to Traveller organisations' own communication objectives, <Col N="513" />Government objectives for Citizen Traveller were unlikely to be met in the future; the management of the campaign did obtain good value for money in procuring services and in the use of those services; the campaign had many achievements to its credit, including engaging the Traveller community, raising Traveller self-esteem and highlighting issues of Traveller accommodation and education; and the existing structures were an inadequate vehicle to carry out the kind of programme which was likely to be successful.</P>
    <P>Given the difficulties arising from the existing structure and that, whatever option for the future was decided upon, new structures would be required, I considered that an orderly winding up of the management company, Traveller Communication Committee Limited, with the payment of all outstanding creditors was the best policy at this stage. Delay would only lead to further expense. I am considering all options for a replacement scheme within the terms of the task force report on the Traveller community and with specific emphasis on the improvement of relationships between the Traveller and settled communities. Any alternative scheme will be considered within available Exchequer resources.

      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that they are proactive in the use of operational resources and legislation enacted by the Oireachtas in combating illegal activities. This includes the services of the Criminal Assets Bureau where appropriate in dealing with the proceeds of crime. I should also mention that the terrorism Bill, which I hope to introduce in the near future, will contain further measures in relation to terrorist finances.</P>

      <P>On 20 April 1998, the Government abolished the investment-based naturalisation scheme. In doing so it also decided that the Minister should initiate a review of the Irish <Col N="514" />Nationality and Citizenship Act to see how it might facilitate investment and, if in the course of that review information emerged that would warrant additional legislative measures, he should consider this. To assist him in conducting the review, the Minister established a review group, comprising representatives of his Department, of which chaired the group, the Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland &ndash; together with two outside experts.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on investment-based naturalisation in Ireland was brought by me before Government in July 2002. I arranged for its publication on 4 August 2002 and a number of copies were placed in the Oireachtas Library at that time. The conclusions of the review group are set out in detail on pages 27 and 28 of the report. In short, the group's conclusion was that, given the growth of the Irish economy, the consequent sharp reduction in unemployment and the improvement in the availability of venture capital, it is inappropriate and unnecessary to introduce an investment-based scheme. A majority believed that the Government should keep open the option of introducing such a scheme, on a statutory basis and on the lines of the rules set out in the report, in the event of a changed economic or employment situation while a minority were opposed to investment-based naturalisation in principle.</P>
      <P>I informed the House in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 5 on 17 October that I had always been opposed to the principle behind the scheme and that there were no circumstances in which I would recommend to Government that we should return to a situation, either with or without statute, where Irish citizenship can be bartered for economic reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>The statistics contained in the annual report of the Garda Síochána for the year 2001 in relation to &ldquo;headline&rdquo; or serious offences for the year 2001 are indeed disappointing. Although, in the period 1996 to 2000, the figures for recorded indictable crime showed a decrease of approximately 27%, the trend has, regrettably, altered in 2001 when Garda statistics indicated an overall increase of 18% over the previous year.</P>
      <P>While these figures, especially in relation to violent assaults, are obviously a cause for concern, they also reflect the targeting of resources and the resultant increased activity on the part of the Garda in addressing this problem. This is confirmed by the detection rate of 75% in the assault category and 86% in the homicide category. I am convinced that this increase underlines the continued need for robust responses to offending behaviour and the need to readily adapt to changing levels and patterns of crime.</P>
      <P>In addition to the current Garda powers in relation to public order, the Criminal Justice Public Order Bill, 2002, currently before the House, will give the Garda significant additional powers to assist them in dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct which most of us would accept are contributing to street crime and violent assaults. The purpose of the Bill is to augment the law so as to tackle the problem of drink-related late night disturbance and the growing problem of late night street violence which has its origins in or outside licensed premises and fast food outlets. It applies to pubs, off-licences, discos, nightclubs, dance venues of all types, amusement arcades, chip shops, take-aways and mobile food vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Garda operations which target such behaviour play a vital role in combating this type of crime. Operation Encounter is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community. Particular attention is paid to nightclubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there <Col N="516" />is potential for disorder. The target hours of the operation are determined locally, based on the specific circumstances prevailing at each location. Particular attention is being paid to ensuring that the owners and managers of such premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public. Additional resources were made available and each regional commander was asked to draw up their own plans to prioritise the deployment of resources.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to focus on youth crime by supporting and developing evidence-based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending by implementing the outstanding relevant provisions of the Children Act, 2001. I am also committed to continuing to support and strengthen the network of Garda youth diversion projects which increased in number from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present. The continued enforcement of the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, relating to the mandatory temporary closure of pubs and off-licences where convictions for allowing underage drinking have been obtained is also a useful weapon in this issue. This has resulted in 118 closure orders against licence holders up to the end September 2002.</P>
    <P>A major expansion of Garda CCTV systems is currently under way with systems to be installed in the following 17 areas &ndash; Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo and Tallaght. The programme for Government also undertakes to grant aid local communities to provide CCTV systems. A grant-aid scheme has already been introduced and grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 is available from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. An Agreed Programme for Government provides for a further increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána of 2,000 to be targeted to benefit those areas of greatest need.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 74 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its interim report on off-licensing, the Commission on Liquor Licensing made a series of recommendations for reforming legislative provisions in relation to off-licences. The commission <Col N="517" />recommended, for example, that applications for off-licences continue to be made to the courts and that notices of such applications be published in the press and be exhibited in a prominent manner at the premises in respect of which the licence is being sought so that interested parties have an opportunity to object if they so wish. Moreover, planning permission should be required in all cases where the sale of spirits and beer is intended.</P>
    <P>The commission's second interim report contains a broad range of recommendations, including recommendations in relation to the licensing of nightclubs, theatres and places of public entertainment. In all cases, the commission recommends that the grant of a liquor licence be made conditional on obtaining planning permission and complying with any conditions attached to such permission. Future reports of the commission may contain further recommendations dealing with the interface between planning and licensing legislation.</P>
    <P>As regards legislative reforms in this area, I have already announced a comprehensive codification of the entire liquor licensing code. This codification will draw on the commission's valuable work and the recommendations set out in its reports. My intention is to rationalise and streamline the licensing laws in order to make them user-friendly and accessible for licensees and the public alike. I believe that open and transparent decision-making procedures, including adequate advance notice for designated notice parties and opportunities for public consultation, are an essential feature of any modern licensing code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of extended hours possibly leading to an increase in alcohol-related problems was discussed in the Dáil and Seanad debates leading up to enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. As the Deputy may be aware, a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights carried out a review of liquor licensing in 1998 and had made a series of recommendations in relation to various aspects of the licensing code, including longer opening hours. In addition, extensive consultations took place with various interested parties prior to the passage of the 2000 Act at which <Col N="518" />the issue of extending opening hours was discussed.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Liquor Licensing, which has the task of reviewing the liquor licensing system, dealt with the general question of trading hours in its second interim report published in July last. The commission's overall conclusion was that since a major reform of licensing hours had been introduced as recently as July 2000, it would not be appropriate to make any recommendations for further changes at that stage. The commission stated, however, that it would return to the issue of trading hours in its final report.</P>
      <P>I should add that the commission recently placed advertisements in the national newspapers seeking submissions on the subject of licensing hours with a view to addressing this issue in its final report. Interested parties may wish to avail of this opportunity to make their views known directly to the commission.</P>
      <P>On the subject of street violence and crime, extensive powers are available to the Garda to deal with late night drinking and disturbances under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. Moreover, as the Deputy is probably aware, in June last, I re-introduced the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, which is now at Second Stage. This legislation will, when enacted, give the Garda significant additional powers in dealing with drunkenness and public disorder.</P>

      <P>The cut in the national anti-racism awareness programme for 2003 must be balanced against an exceptionally high allocation in 2002 of &euro;2.59 million, of which the awareness programme expects to spend &euro;2.3 million. The Government allocated &euro;5.7 million over a three year period to the awareness programme, which translates to an average of &euro;1.9 million per annum. The programme has been allocated &euro;958,000 for 2003. This is &euro;1 million less than the average of &euro;1.9 million annual spend implied in the original Government allocation. The reduction is part of a number of reductions across the board in areas of the public sector in 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NCCRI was established in July 1998, funded mainly by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The committee provides a forum for Government Departments, agencies and non-governmental organisations to <Col N="520" />come together within the area of anti-discrimination. Its overall aim is to provide an ongoing structure to develop programmes and actions aimed at developing an integrated approach against discrimination, particularly racism, and to act in a policy advisory role to the Government. Under section 38, framework 111, of the PPF, increased funding was promised to NCCRI to enable it to undertake additional measures to address racism. In 2001 the allocation was increased to &euro;250,138 with &euro;340,000 for 2002. The reduction to &euro;323,000 for 2003 is a part of an overall number of reductions across the board in areas of the public sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell) Michael McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides a focal point for disability equality policy and legislation development. As part of that remit, my Department collects data in relation to the 3% <Col N="521" />target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service, excluding the Civil Service, data for which is collected by the equality unit of the Department of Finance. Although the target has yet to be achieved, there has been a degree of progress in recent years. The overall statistics for the public service, other than the Civil Service, at 1 January each year are as follows: 1998, 1.52%; 1999, 1.72%; 2000, 1.89%; and 2001, 2.01%. The figures given for January 2000 and January 2001 are provisional figures, as returns are outstanding from a number of individual public service bodies.</P>
      <P>The 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities is a Government-led positive action initiative that applies in over 200 public service bodies, varying in size and diversity of jobs and the range of work involved. Public service bodies may have staff levels ranging from one to 10,000 employees and some public service bodies have exceeded the target. However, it is recognised that other bodies have performed poorly. Under a Government commitment in the PPF, every Department is required to take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service at an early date.</P>
      <P>A monitoring committee established and chaired by my Department continues to monitor and guide progress in relation to the target. It has supported a number of initiatives in recent years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among, and giving information to, chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars and publication of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this option at the public sector careers expo in April 2001; and commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations. The report, published in November 2001 and titled Research Project on the Effective Recruitment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service, provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to assist future progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in partnership with the Equality Authority, will launch an employer resource pack on 3 December 2002 to assist public service employers in the recruitment and retention of people with disabilities. My colleague, the Minister for Finance is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service. The PPF included a commitment to review the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service to ascertain ongoing adherence to the 3% employment target. As at December 2001, the percentage of people <Col N="522" />with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.78%. A table setting out the percentage of people with a disability in each Government Department and office as at December 2001 is attached. The overall percentage has increased slightly since December 2000, when it stood at 2.58%, but the fact that the percentage has dropped below 3% is a cause for concern. The Department of Finance has written to the all heads of Departments and offices to ensure that they are aware of their legal obligations and of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3% target.</P>
    <P>In light of the commitment in the PPF and in order to establish how to improve adherence to the quota, the Department of Finance, in partnership with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Civil Service Commission, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The research is complete and will be published in early 2003. The research maps out the current arrangements in respect of career progression for people with disabilities, highlights the challenges they face when seeking to progress and makes recommendations for a model of best practice in this area for the future. All Departments are required to appoint a disability liaison officer to act on behalf of people with disabilities in Departments. In 2001, the Department of Finance established a network of disability liaison officers which meets regularly. A programme of special training for all disability liaison officers and human resource managers in Departments was held in March and April 2002.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Garda inspectorate which will have the power to investigate complaints and will have the powers of an ombudsman. I have made clear my resolve to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals for this in 2003 and work is already under way in my Department on the matter. I have also made clear that, in preparing the legislative proposals, I will give particular attention to the nature and extent of the powers which it will be necessary for the inspectorate to have. One of the issues which will be examined in this regard, which arose in connection with the investigation referred to in the questions, will be the extent to which members of the force will, subject of course to their constitutional rights, be obliged to co-operate with any investigation undertaken by or on behalf of the inspectorate.</P>

      <P>As I have previously informed the House, the Garda Commissioner has appointed a detective chief superintendent to conduct an analytical review of all cases of clerical sexual abuse previously reported to and investigated by the Garda Síochána and to review particular cases with a view to establishing whether further lines of inquiry might be available which would lead to the preferring of criminal charges. I am informed that the detective chief superintendent is investigating new cases which have come to notice as a result of the special telephone line set up for victims. As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the practice that Ministers comment in detail on ongoing Garda investigations which are operational matters for the Garda authorities. I also refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 46 of today's date.</P>

      <P>As has been stated previously in this House, the Explosives Act, 1875, is under review by my Department. The review will extend to the law and policy on the regulation and control of fireworks and, accordingly, will address issues of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Fireworks are deemed to be explosives under the provisions of the Explosives Act, 1875. They may be imported into the State only under an importation licence granted by my Department. It is a long-standing policy that these licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by professional and experienced operators. The Explosives Act also provides for restrictions on the sale of fireworks. Despite these restrictions, fireworks are imported illegally, especially around Hallowe'en. However, the Garda Commissioner has informed me that each year the Garda Síochána puts in place special operations to address the problem in the lead up to and during that time. This involves the gathering of information and appropriate follow-up action by the Garda aimed at the seizure of illicit fireworks and involves close liaison with local authorities.</P>

      <P>The allocation to the Justice group of Votes for 2003 represents a 7% increase overall on the allocation for 2002. For example, the allocation for the Garda Vote for 2003 shows an increase of almost &euro;19 million over the corresponding provision for 2002. Similarly, the allocation for the Prisons Vote has also been increased by &euro;15 million over the corresponding provision for 2002. The allocation to the Courts Vote for 2003 is &euro;84.431 million. While this represents a small reduction in the Vote, the Courts Service expects to provide the same high level of service in 2003 as it did in 2002. In the case of the Land Registry Vote, savings, arising from efficiencies brought about by the increased computerisation of the Land Registry, are largely being diverted towards data capture to increase further the computerisation of Land Registry records. This should lead to an improved service for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding allocated to the Justice, Equality and Law Reform Vote represents a 21% increase on the allocation for 2002. This increase takes into account the allocation of funding to certain priority areas. However, it will also require that economies are achieved in a number of other areas and that efficiencies be introduced, where possible. In relation to levels of policing, the primary aim will be to maintain the existing level of front-line policing services to the public by focusing on key services, increasing efficiency and <Col N="526" />obtaining best value for money. Adequate provision has been included in the allocations to provide for training.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there have been some difficulties in the provision of services to the District Court in County Clare by the probation and welfare service. I understand that the probation and welfare officer covering the district court became unavailable for duty due to sick leave in August 2001 and it subsequently became clear that the period of sick leave would be longer than anticipated. Unfortunately, constraints on probation and welfare service staff resources were such that even a temporary replacement could not be provided. Given these special circumstances, the personnel section of my Department agreed in April 2002 to place an advertisement for the recruitment of a locum in <i>The Clare Champion</i>. That competition did not yield any suitable candidate.</P>
      <P>The probation and welfare service subsequently put in place an interim arrangement using staff from adjacent areas in order to provide a service to the courts in County Clare. This temporary arrangement, providing five-day cover, has now been partially reduced with the return from sick leave of the assigned probation and welfare officer, who currently attends two days per week. The service in County Clare is the equivalent of one probation and welfare officer and is consistent with the allocation of staff in other District Court areas. I am assured by the service that both the assistant principal probation and welfare officer and the senior probation and welfare officer for the region continue to be available to meet the judge, at his convenience, to discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government approved the purchase of a second Garda helicopter in November 1998. A tender competition was held and an EC135 was ordered in August 1999. The EC135 represents a new generation of helicopter technology. It is built to order and delivery time depends on the production line and demand from other customers. The basic shell of the helicopter was manufactured in the Eurocopter facility at Donauworth in Germany and delivered in December 2000 to McAlpine Helicopters in Oxford to be fitted out with specialist police equipment. This was a major task. Following this, the necessary trials were carried out allowing acceptance by the Garda authorities of the helicopter in December 2001. This is the earliest possible date that the helicopter was in a position to fly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 2001, the Government had approved a proposal from the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to contract out the piloting and maintenance of the EC135 for a trial period. The Air Corps had previously indi<Col N="529" />cated that it would have to contract out the maintenance of this aircraft and it was decided to avail of the opportunity to explore other piloting and maintenance arrangements with a view to assessing alternatives in terms of such factors as efficiency and cost-effectiveness. An interdepartmental committee was established to oversee and facilitate this task.</P>
    <P>This committee, having considered the various issues, submitted an interim report to the then Minister in which they recommended, for legal reasons, that the EC135 be introduced into service, on an interim basis, on the State military register while the longer term options were explored.</P>
    <P>The matter was again submitted to Government which approved in April 2002 the placement, on an interim basis, of the EC135 on the State military register with the Air Corps responsible for the piloting of the craft. The maintenance of the EC135 was again to be outsourced.</P>
    <P>The placement process referred to in the preceding paragraph involves an examination and certification of the craft and its specialist equipment by the Air Corps which has been making the necessary arrangements to ensure that the aircraft is acceptable for placement on the military register; that the necessary documentation is in order and that the helicopter could be flown and serviced. This placement process is now nearing completion and the EC135 is due to transfer onto the State military register in early December 2002. At this stage, the EC135 will be delivered to the State and is expected to commence operations later in the month.</P>
    <P>There is no dispute about who is in overall charge of the operations carried out by the Garda air support unit. The policing functions-missions are determined by the Garda authorities and under present arrangements the flying and maintenance of the craft &ndash; one fixed-wing aircraft and one helicopter &ndash; are the responsibility of the Minister for Defence and the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of the EC135, as previously explained, is being outsourced and this is currently the subject of a tender competition being conducted by the Department of Defence. A draft service level agreement between the Air Corps and the Garda Síochána on operating and reporting structures covering all aspects of joint operations is also nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The entering into service of the EC135 will greatly expand the area of operations of the Garda air support unit and allow for greater availability of air support in the fight against crime.</P>

    <P>As the House will be aware, as a consequence of these allegations, the Garda Commissioner appointed a chief superintendent from outside the region to review all aspects of the matter. The <Col N="531" />chief superintendent carried out a complete audit of all headline and relevant non-headline offences in the Garda district in question for 2001. The audit examined all detected offences and the evidence leading to those offences being declared as detected.</P>
    <P>The audit was subsequently extended to incidents in Waterford in the years 1997 to 2000. A sample survey of similar incidents nationwide was also undertaken. The audit also examined compliance with the crime counting rules as they currently apply.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that these three audits have been carried out. As a result of the first audit into the Waterford statistics for 2001, I am informed that the number of crimes recorded has been reduced from 2,487 to 2,413, a 3% reduction, while the number of crimes detected has reduced from 1,599 to 1,411 resulting in a reduction in the detection rate from 64.3% to 58.5%.</P>
    <P>The second audit re-examined 400 randomly sampled offences from the Waterford district, comprising 100 offences from each of the years 1997 to 2000. Of the 400 offences examined, 55.8% resulted in a prosecution, and a further 20% resulted in a referral to the juvenile diversion programme. Of the remaining 97 incidents, 11 offences, or 2.8% of the total sample, were found to have been marked detected in error.</P>
    <P>The third audit examined 3,100 offences from the rest of the country in 2001. These incidents were selected using a computer-based random number generator with a pre-defined quota being set for each division. It was found that 65% of these incidents resulted in a prosecution and 12.5% in a referral to the Garda juvenile division programme. Of the remaining 22%, it was found that 53 offences, or 1.7% of the sample, had been marked detected in error.</P>
    <P>The chief superintendent has made a number of recommendations in relation to the formulation of clear crime counting rules and the establishment of clear criteria regarding reclassification of suspects, together with the formulation of strict guidelines for supervisors' review of incidents on the PULSE system and the establishment of a data quality control unit within the Garda Síochána. The chief superintendent has further recommended the building of system safeguards within the PULSE system will ensure accurate and up-to-date information.</P>
    <P>Arising from the audits, it has been concluded that no evidence was found of any abuse of procedures in recording crime and that all decisions were made in good faith. The Garda Commissioner has informed me that he has accepted the recommendations contained in the report and I look forward to early progress being made on their implementation. I have asked the commissioner to make arrangements to publish the report and he has done so yesterday.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated, I am firmly of the view that public confidence must be upheld in the <Col N="532" />validity and legitimacy of crime statistics generally. That is why, irrespective of the outcome of the investigation into the Waterford statistics and without in any way questioning the validity of statistics contained in the commissioner's report, I obtained the agreement of the Government to establish an expert group on crime statistics to examine the methods of collation and presentation of crime statistics by the Garda Síochána and other organisations involved in criminal prosecution and to conduct national crime victimisation surveys every two years in order to promote the availability of complementary sources of crime data. In the context of the introduction of the PULSE system, the expert group will develop an accepted framework for the production and presentation of reported crime statistics over the coming decades. Such a framework, to be agreed following wide-ranging expert consultation, will also serve to inform and reassure members of the public of the integrity, validity and usefulness of official crime statistics. Membership of the expert group, which I expect to announce shortly, will be representative of the relevant agencies. The group will be required to present its initial findings within a 12 month period.</P>
    <P>Together with the improvements to be implemented by the commissioner, the reforms which I am undertaking will help to place the preparation of information on crime on a modern, transparent basis thus facilitating us all in continuing to devise effective strategies in fighting crime.</P>

      <P>The relatively high cost of keeping a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison, which is of the order of &euro;177,000 per year, arises primarily because of the unique security nature of this prison. Security considerations require a higher staff:prisoner ratio.</P>
      <P>The average costs for Portlaoise Prison also reflect the general cost burden created through the older structures in some of our prison facilities. It is proposed, when finances permit, to modernise this facility under the prison service building programme and this development will include the use of new technologies, a building management system and recent developments in operational security building design to ensure that maximum operational efficiencies are achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Prisons Service is committed to addressing the issue of costs across all prisons with particular reference to the cost of overtime. <Col N="533" />This commitment includes Portlaoise Prison and is expected to make a significant contribution to the reduction of average costs of keeping a prisoner there in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 89 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Shanganagh Castle was opened in 1969 as an open detention centre for males aged between 16 and 21 years of age. The centre, which stands on grounds of 24 acres, has accommodation for 60 inmates. However, it has been increasingly difficult to identify young male offenders suitable for this type of open prison accommodation. Shanganagh Castle had an average offender occupancy of 30 inmates last year and this has fallen again this year, with only 16 inmates being detained there at present. In addition, the full implementation of the provisions of the Children Act, 2001, will mean that 16 and 17 years old inmates must be completely segregated in the prison system, resulting in a further drop in those offenders who might be found suitable for transfer to Shanagnagh Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual cost of keeping an offender at Shanganagh Castle in 2001 was &euro;127,000, which is <Col N="534" />significantly higher than the average overall cost per prisoner of &euro;79,000 in the same year.</P>
    <P>In view of the very considerable decline in the number of young offenders found suitable for transfer to Shanganagh Castle in recent years, the Irish Prisons Service established a group to examine the options for its continued use as a detention centre. While the report of the group identified an increase in the upper age limit of offenders as one option, it also recognised that:</P>
    <P>If none of the recommended options were considered viable then, as the current regime at Shanganagh Castle cannot be justified on operational or financial grounds, the closure of the castle and the subsequent disposal of the site will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>I recognise the important service that Shanganagh Castle and its staff have given to the prison system, in particular in terms of dealing with juvenile offenders, over the years. However, having carefully considered this report, its current viability, and the options available for its future use, it is my intention to close the centre in order to contribute to the control of costs in the Irish Prisons Service, to make more effective use of Prisons Service staffing and other resources, and to release funds through the sale of Shanganagh Castle to be used, subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, for more other productive prison-related purposes.</P>
    <P>The small number of inmates currently in Shanganagh Castle can be accommodated elsewhere in the prison system without difficulty, or, in appropriate cases, given temporary release as part of the normal process of preparation for re-integration into society upon final release. St. Patrick's Institution, which currently houses offenders in the same age category as Shanganagh Castle, has introduced important new programmes over the past two years for the rehabilitation of offenders, including a drug-free wing and a positive sentence management programme. I believe that the needs of offenders in this age category can be adequately met elsewhere in the prison system and in particular, in St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>Closure of the centre would also necessitate the re-assignment of its complement of 43 Prisons Service staff to other institutions. The terms of such re-assignments will be the subject of discussions with the Prison Officer Association. Discussions will also be necessary with the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee in regard to the position of the full-time and part-time teachers at Shanganagh Castle. The probation and welfare officer currently assigned to the centre will be assigned to other duties.</P>

      <P>As I told the House in reply to questions on 5 November, I fully accept the need to protect vulnerable persons who are under threat of violence in their home and I am satisfied that effective provisions to enable the courts to grant interim barring orders <i>ex parte</i>, which are consistent with the Constitution and the Supreme Court's judgment, can be included in amending legislation. Considerable progress has been made in developing proposals in this regard and I hope the draft legislation can be published by Christmas. As I have said before, I will consult with organisations involved in this area and take account of their views.</P>

      <P>The Government noted, on 19 November 2002, my proposal to authorise the introduction of the following &ldquo;less lethal&rdquo; weapons for use by the Garda emergency response unit where this is necessary to avoid the use of firearms: bean bag shot &ndash; this is effectively a bag filled with shot fired from a shotgun so that it does not penetrate the body but delivers a blow with the intention of temporarily incapacitating the person; pepper spray device &ndash; this is a special aerosol projector which is designed to deliver a directional pepper spray to a distance of 25-30 feet; and ferret pepper spray shot &ndash; this is a shotgun cartridge device that is intended to penetrate a door or window and deliver pepper spray inside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" />The internal procedure within the Garda Síochána, before approval was sought for the introduction of these devices, did involve a report being compiled by a working party consisting of members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In order to fully assess the requirements for the force it was necessary for that working party to consult with a number of other police forces in a confidential manner on the operation and use of such &ldquo;less lethal&rdquo; weapons. Consultation was also required on a confidential basis with suppliers and manufacturers.</P>
    <P>In view of the confidentiality of the material gathered, the Garda authorities do not consider it appropriate to release the report. I agree with this.</P>

      <P>The current statistics clearly indicate that significant progress continues to be made in relation to the processing of asylum applications and that the increase in processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's asylum strategy is making a real impact on the backlog of cases on hands. This is evidenced by the fact that the number of backlog cases, that is, cases which are over six months old, on hand in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal as at 31 October 2002 is now down to approximately 1,400 &ndash; from a figure of approximately 6,500 at the end of September 2001 &ndash; the vast majority of which are in the final stages of processing. The ORAC is currently scheduling asylum applicants who applied in September 2002 for interview.</P>
      <P>At the end of October 2002 there were 7,670 cases on hand in the ORAC and RAT, the vast majority of which were received in 2002.</P>

      <P>Although legislative measures and enforcement activities have an important role to play in addressing the issue of underage alcohol consumption, a much broader-based response, involving a range of State agencies, the drinks industry, the media and, specifically, parents, is required.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána has not encountered any significant operational difficulties in preventing underage abuse of alcohol. I am further informed that the Garda authorities are satisfied that the legislative framework currently in place is adequate to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, <Col N="538" />represents a considerable strengthening of the law in this regard. It increased fines for breaches of the law in relation to underage drinking, abolished the defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in any proceedings against the licensee and made provision for a new penalty, a temporary closure order, for conviction for the sale of alcohol to underage persons. From the date of commencement of the Act up to 23 September 2002, some 371 prosecutions were taken, with 118 closure orders made, of which 19 were under appeal.</P>
    <P>The national age card scheme, introduced by statutory regulations in 1999, is designed to assist licensees in complying with the law. The scheme is intended for persons who have already attained 18 years of age and who are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises and who wish to do so. Its purpose is to provide evidence of age where a doubt exists. Approximately 80,000 age cards have been issued to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell) Michael McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers for Justice enjoy a considerable discretion under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts in deciding whether or not to grant a certificate of naturalisation.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, sets out five conditions which must be fulfilled prior to the grant of a certification of naturalisation. The decision to naturalise is at the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice of the day. Therefore, the Act of 1956 empowers the Minister to refuse a certificate even where all of the aforementioned conditions are fulfilled. There may be cases where previous Ministers for Justice have refused, in their absolute discretion, to grant a certificate of naturalisation and where I, or indeed another Minister for Justice, might have taken the opposite view and granted the application.</P>
      <P>Conversely, the statutory conditions for naturalisation can be waived by the Minister in the case of certain categories of person even if one &ndash; or indeed all &ndash; of those conditions remain unfulfilled. I have, and my predecessors had, considerable powers of discretion in relation to these matters under the Act of 1956. It is not a power that is vested in the Government &ndash; it is a power that in law is vested in the Minister. Again there may be cases where previous Ministers for Justice would or would not have waived any or all of the conditions for naturalisation and where I might have taken the opposite view.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise therefore that the exercise of absolute discretion by the Minister of the day is a central element in the naturalisation process and the fact that I or any other Minister for Justice, with the benefit of hindsight, might disagree with a particular decision cannot be construed as an assertion that the certificate in question was not properly issued for legitimate reasons.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1956 prescribes a case where the applicant has &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; as one in which the Minister can waive any or all of the conditions for naturalisation. Unfortunately, the Act gives no guidance on the precise meaning of the term &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;. The rules of the investment based naturalisation scheme were intended to give such guidance in certain types of cases &ndash; that is cases which became known as investment based naturalisation cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules were administrative in character and formed no part of the legislative regime underpinning the naturalisation process. In my response to Parliamentary Question No. 5 on 17 October last, I am on record as having described the scheme which operated as being dependent <Col N="540" />on a very loose and questionable interpretation of the 1956 Act. Indeed in September 1996 the then Government decided to accept no new applications made in accordance with the administrative scheme pending the introduction of new legislation. However, the fact that I hold that view cannot be construed as implying that naturalisation certificates issued in good faith by my predecessors were not properly and legitimately issued.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on investment-based naturalisation, which I published in August, reveals that the September 1996 decision was not applied to cases, which were in the pipeline at that time. With certain exceptions, to which the report refers, the whole focus of activity after September 1996 was on processing applications which were outstanding at that time. My immediate predecessor accepted no new applications from investors under the scheme. Administrative schemes create legal rights and obligations and can be the subject matter of judicial review proceedings. Once a scheme is in place any Minister must operate it fairly and in accordance with the principles of natural justice. Successive Ministers for Justice, with the approval of their respective Governments, operated the scheme on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>A review of the maternity protection legislation was carried out in 2000 by a working group, chaired by my Department, which comprised the social partners and relevant Government Departments and agencies. The group's recommendation to increase the periods of maternity and additional maternity leave was implemented very shortly after the publication of its report in February 2001. The increases were announced in budget 2001 and implemented with effect from March 2001. Identical increases were simultaneously applied to the adoptive leave entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 2000, the Government approved the implementation of the other recommendations of the working group by amendment of the existing legislation through statutory instrument or primary legislation, as appropriate. At that time, the Government also decided to amend the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, to reflect the proposed changes to the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, where appropriate. On 17 July 2002, Government approval was obtained for the drafting of a Bill to give effect to the remaining recom<Col N="541" />mendations of the working group. The Bill in relation to the amendment of the Maternity Leave Act, 1994, is currently with the Parliamentary Counsel. It is expected that the Bill will be published early next year and enacted as soon as possible afterwards.</P>

      <P>Section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to revoke a certificate of naturalisation in a number of specified circumstances. Those circumstances include cases where: the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances; or the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State; or the person to whom it is granted is also, under the law of a country at war with the State, a citizen of that country; or the person to whom it is granted <Col N="543" />has by any voluntary act other than marriage acquired another citizenship.</P>
      <P>Before revoking a certificate of naturalisation, I must give notice to the person to whom the certificate was granted of my intention, stating the grounds therefor and the right of that person to apply to me for an inquiry as to the reasons for the revocation. If the person in question makes such a request, I am obliged to appoint a committee of inquiry consisting of a chairman having judicial experience and such other person as I may think fit, and refer the case to it. Thereafter the committee must report their findings to me with a view to informing my decision.</P>
      <P>I hope that it is clear therefore that the revocation of a certificate of naturalisation is a serious matter and one in which I must be in a position to show that the legal requirements have been fulfilled.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that if the circumstances of any particular case warrant revocation under these provisions, I will have no hesitation in utilising my statutory powers to the fullest extent possible.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the PULSE computer project into the Garda Síochána represents a major commitment by the Government to provide a modern computer system for the force. Its introduction into the Garda Síochána was accompanied by a major change management programme, which included an extensive training programme for over 12,000 users of the system. The PULSE computer system has been operational for three years with the software deployed to over 180 locations in phased releases. The fourth and final phase of the system is due for deployment nationally in 2003.</P>
      <P>Availability of the PULSE system has averaged 99% over the past 12 month period when measured over 24 hours each day of the year. There have been a small number of periods of unavailability for scheduled maintenance and for implementation of new releases of the system. There have also been a small number of unscheduled outages, which fall within acceptable levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usage of the system has exceeded the targets set by the designers of the system and upgrades to the underlying telecommunications system have been necessary to cater for the high volume of usage. Inevitably with such a large sys<Col N="544" />tem there have been some teething problems and I am informed by the Garda authorities that these have been largely resolved. Further work is currently in progress to enhance the performance of the system and these changes will be deployed over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The PULSE system is now used for a wide range of Garda activity, which was formally carried out manually. The new processes are working well and a large number of success stories have been attributed to the enhanced operational capabilities provided by the system.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to a policy of equality of opportunity, one element of which is the creation of an environment where women achieve their full potential. It is therefore a matter of concern to me that women continue to earn less on average than men. However, it is worth pointing out in relation to the recently published CSO statistical yearbook for 2002 that women's average hourly earnings are 76% of men's, and perhaps more importantly that the manufacturing sector is not representative of the economy as a whole.</P>

The group comprises representatives of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance; <Col N="545" />the CSO; the social partners; and the Equality Authority.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board is currently reviewing its allocation for 2003 in order to utilise its resources in a way that will ensure the provision of services to the greatest number of persons possible within a reasonable period of time. I can also inform the Deputy that the allocation of increased funding and resources to the Legal Aid Board in recent years, up from &euro;10.656 million in 1997 to &euro;17.075 million in 2003, has led to a significant reduction in waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can further inform the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is <Col N="546" />accorded for certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately. Such a system for priorities is necessary to ensure that, for example, persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with speedy service. In 2001, the total number of priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 1,500, or about 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the board continually monitors the operation of its law centre network and where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>

      <Quest>the training and rehabilitation services given to individuals after they have served prison sentences; and the changes he intends making in this area.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>Voluntary aftercare support is offered to all prisoners who wish to avail of it.</P>
      <P>However, once a person's prison sentence has ended, there is no enduring obligation on that individual to remain in contact with the criminal justice system or with the agencies of my Department. There are a small number of exceptions to this including sex offenders who may be required to register with their local Garda station and life sentenced prisoners who may be required to remain under supervision by the probation and welfare service for many years after their release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offenders who leave custody having served their sentences will usually have had contact with probation and welfare officers, the prison education service and other services within the prison to facilitate preparation for their return to the community in a way that maximises the prospect of a crime free lifestyle. Criminogenic issues will usually have been identified and addressed while in custody and contact initiated with the relevant <Col N="547" />support services. Offenders are encouraged and facilitated on release in continuing this process by linking up with community based agencies, dealing with educational and vocational training, alternative accommodation, job placement, substance abuse treatment, etc. Many of the services are provided by voluntary bodies and community groups, some operating under the aegis of the probation and welfare service while others who accept referrals of offenders are supported financially by my Department in the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>While the specific focus of the Deputy's question is on after-release training and rehabilitative services for persons whose sentences have ended, I should also mention that the prison service provides to those in custody a wide range of rehabilitative programmes which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging them to lead non-offending lives on release.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the National Economic and Social Forum published a report earlier this year on the re-integration of prisoners. A central focus of this report is the barriers to reintegration and the need for targeted and coherent mechanisms to ensure that prisoners can be more effectively integrated back into the community. The report's overall conclusion is that what is required are key institutional mechanisms and models to spearhead and ensure effective follow-through on the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Priority is being given to developing these mechanisms. A high level co-ordination group on prisoner reintegration has been established, and is chaired by an Assistant Secretary from my Department. This group is composed of senior officials from the Departments and statutory agencies who are identified in the report as having a role to play in progressing its implementation. The group will also be drawing on the expertise of the many community and voluntary groups that have experience of dealing with the issues raised by the report. The group is currently examining the areas for action highlighted in the report and will oversee the implementation of the appropriate recommendations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" />Arising from the judgment delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal which is referred to in the question, I issued a public statement on 1 August 2002, to the effect that the Garda Commissioner had, on that day, suspended two members of the Garda Síochána, a superintendent and a garda. My statement also mentioned that a third member of the Garda Síochána referred to in the judgment, a detective garda, already stood suspended. The position of the superintendent who stands suspended will be the subject of consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on six cows under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme on 15 April 2002. Four of the cows he applied on were in fact in-calf heifers on the date of application. My Department wrote to the person named on 7 August 2002 requesting calving dates for these four animals and, as no reply was received, issued a reminder letter to him on 7 October 2002. An official from Teagasc contacted my Department on 31 October on behalf of the person named and a letter was received from Teagasc on 7 November 2002 stating that the person named had understood he could apply on in-calf heifers as cows provided that they calved before the closing date of the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme on 28 June 2002. A letter from the person named was also enclosed requesting to withdraw the application and to re-apply for 2002 suckler cow premium on four cows and two heifers. My Department has considered this request and has decided to accept the withdrawal of the original application and his re-application. The date of the new application is 28 June 2002. This application is now being processed for payment. Payment will issue to him shortly.</P>

      <P>The greater Dublin strategic drainage study commenced in June 2001 after the Department of the Environment and Local Government approved the appointment of consultants to Dublin Corporation, now Dublin City Council. A full study of the Tolka catchment was not included in this. At the initiative of the Commissioners of Public Works, the study was extended in order to provide for a detailed flood study of the Tolka River catchment which would also outline options for flood alleviation. Sanction from the Department of Finance to the Office of Public Works for the expenditure of &euro;867,366.72 in respect of consultancy fees for the study was received in February 2002 and the consultants were formally appointed by Dublin City Council in April 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study is expected to be completed in May 2003 which is approximately two months longer than anticipated at the outset. This is to allow for more detailed modelling of the catchment in order to facilitate more accurate predictions of flood behaviour. The consultants have been <Col N="554" />requested to produce an interim report on what measures, if any, can be taken to alleviate flooding in the areas worst affected in the past few weeks. This interim report is expected to be produced in the next few days.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for relief from tax under the Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, that the applicant must meet the specified medical criteria and be in possession of a primary medical <Col N="555" />certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior medical officer who is an official of the local health board. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, which is an independent body whose decision is final. Neither my Department nor the Revenue Commissioners has any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of the relief.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the administration of the relief, are unable to consider an application without the issue of a primary medical certificate.</P>
      <P>While my Department has no involvement in the operation of the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person concerned was refused the issue of a primary medical certificate by the senior area medical officer and that this refusal has been appealed to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal. The person concerned is awaiting assessment by the board since November 2001, and I am advised that an appointment for assessment will be made as soon as possible. I understand that the length of time a person waits to be assessed can vary from 12 to 18 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>The demands imposed on modern analytical laboratories rendered inadequate the existing facilities at Abbotstown. These facilities contain insufficient and inadequate space, unsuitable layouts, and extremely basic mechanical and electrical services. Problems also arise in relation to specific building regulations, fire safety codes <Col N="556" />and health and safety regulations. The buildings do not comply with current recommendations on such matters as bio-safety containment and fire evacuation. Furthermore, they contain no category 3 containment facilities &ndash; facilities suitable for work with organisms which may cause severe human disease and which present a serious hazard to laboratory workers.</P>
      <P>The need for new laboratory facilities was accepted by the international team of consultants, commissioned by Government, to review the Campus and Stadium Ireland project, in its February 2002 report. The development of such facilities, at Backweston, represents a major commitment by the Government to ensuring compliance with the highest European and international standards required of testing laboratories.</P>
      <P>Given the need to replace the existing facilities at Abbotstown, the fact that contracts for the new laboratory facilities were awarded earlier this year and that construction is well under way on site, I will not be reviewing the decision to relocate the Department of Agriculture and Food Laboratories and the State Laboratory from Abbotstown to Backweston.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issues, which Amnesty International has raised in its current campaign regarding human rights in Russia and I take these concerns very seriously.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a parliamentary question on 20 November 2002, Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, supports continued dialogue with the Russian Federation on a range of human rights issues including the situation in Chechnya. At the EU-Russia summit on 11 November 2002, the Danish Presidency, led by Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, raised our concerns about Chechnya with President Vladimir Putin and reiterated the European Union's belief that there must be a political solution to the situation there.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also raised the issue of human rights in Russia, including Chechnya, in international fora and bilaterally with the Russian Federation, through diplomatic channels.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge the right of the Government of the Russian Federation to defend its territorial integrity, to fight against terrorism and crime and to protect its population. However, the fight against terrorism must be conducted in accordance with internationally accepted human rights standards.</P>

      <P>I understand it is now common practice for clubs and bars to require the presentation of photo-identification by persons seeking entry to their premises to verify that they meet the age requirements set down by law. It is a matter for these institutions to determine which forms of identity are acceptable for this purpose.</P>
      <P>While, historically, passports were used primarily as identification documents for foreign travel, their use for other purposes, including age verification for entry to clubs and bars, has become more widespread in recent times. I have no objection to this practice provided the conditions on which the passport is issued, including that it should not be allowed to pass into the possession of an unauthorised person and that it remains the property of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, are respected.</P>
      <P>I am aware that another form of photo identification for entry to clubs and bars, the age card, is issued by the Garda Síochána under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 (Age Card) Regulations, 1999. Questions regarding the application of these regulations should be addressed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

The embassy in Mexico has informed the Colombian authorities of the intention of the three members of the Oireachtas and other Irish citizens to travel to Colombia to attend the next session of the trial of the three Irish men, and has requested that they be facilitated in every appropriate way. I have also instructed the embassy to communicate <Col N="558" />to the Colombian authorities the concerns of the Deputy in regard to security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland accepts the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council of December 1999 which state that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria which apply to the other candidate countries. These criteria include the political criteria laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 which stipulate that candidate countries must have achieved &ldquo;stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities&rdquo;. In this respect, Ireland believes that it is necessary to ensure that, as with all the candidate countries, Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria before any accession negotiations can begin.</P>
      <P>The 2002 regular report on Turkey's progress towards accession issued by the European Commission on 9 October commended Turkey for &ldquo;noticeable progress&rdquo; made towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria, including reforms adopted in the past year. The package of reforms adopted in August 2002 is seen as &ldquo;particularly far-reaching&rdquo;. Taken together, these reforms provide much of the groundwork for strengthening democracy and the protection of human rights in Turkey. However, the Commission report concludes that Turkey does not fully meet the political criteria and that a number of important issues arising under the political criteria have &ldquo;yet to be adequately addressed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting in Brussels on 24 and 25 October likewise welcomed the steps taken by Turkey towards meeting the Copenhagen political criteria. The Council noted that this had brought forward the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey and it encouraged Turkey to pursue its reform process and to take further concrete steps in the direction of implementation, which would advance Turkey's accession in accordance with the same principles and criteria as are applied to the other candidate states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the human rights reforms which have been adopted by the Turkish Parliament in the past year. I also welcome the commitment to further enhance human rights in Turkey made by the leader of the governing Justice and Development Party, Mr. Erdogan, to the Taoiseach at their meeting in Dublin on Thursday last. The <Col N="559" />next few weeks leading up to the European Council in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December will be very important in determining the future relations between the EU and Turkey. Ireland will be as helpful as possible in facilitating Turkey's candidature subject to the necessary criteria being fully adhered to.</P>

      <P>A total of eight proposals have been submitted for action by my Department from the Dublin north-west inner city RAPID area which, I understand, corresponds to the area covered by the Dublin Central constituency. These proposals relate to a number of areas, including adult and community education, early school leaving, school refurbishment and extension, and additional teaching staff. To date, I have approved funding of &euro;75,000 in respect of three of these proposals in the area of adult and community education. This consists of &euro;20,000 to support two pathways ex-offender projects and &euro;55,000 to support Henrietta Adult and Community Education Service and the St. Vincent's Trust. The remaining projects are being considered by my Department in the context of available resources.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funding mentioned above, I have recently allocated &euro;2 million to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee under the back to education initiative. This will provide important second chance opportunities in disadvantaged communities. The Deputy will also be interested to know that my Department has recently appointed two community education facilitators across the City of Dublin VEC area who will be a valuable resource to RAPID areas, including Dublin north-west inner city.</P>
      <P>There is already a significant level of investment in the north-west inner city RAPID area by my Department under the various programmes and schemes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage in the formal and non-formal sectors such as the home-school-community-liaision scheme, the school completion programme, Giving Children an Even Break, third level access programmes and adult education and youth programmes. Tackling educational disadvantage is one of my key priorities and I intend to ensure that available resources are prioritised on an ongoing basis to target the most disadvantaged communities, including the RAPID areas, to overcome the barriers to participating in education and achieving better outcomes.</P>

      <P>There have been repeated requests from teachers of home economics, both through the NCCA course committee and the Association of Teachers of Home Economics, to have the revised course implemented because the course offered until 2002 was in place for more than 30 years and was out of date.</P>
      <P>Since 1 November 2002, the revised syllabus in home economics is the official syllabus and it is this revised syllabus that will be examined in June 2004. All examination papers must be set in accordance with the syllabus as indicated in Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools which is reissued on a yearly basis. The rules and programmes for the 2002-03 school year indicates that the home economics examination in 2004 will be based on the revised syllabus.</P>
      <P>My decision to implement the revised syllabus from 1 November 2002 was notified to schools well in advance and any attempt to alter this decision would be most disruptive for schools and teachers who have already planned for and commenced its implementation. The barrier to participation by some teachers in in-service for the home economics syllabus has been removed as a result of the recent ballot conducted by the ASTI. My Department has already informed the school authorities that in-service will be provided over the next fortnight for those teachers who missed the recent in-service. My Department will also make arrangements to provide appropriate in-service for teachers who did not avail of in-service in the last school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, a range of supports to teachers have been provided. These include curriculum guidelines, teachers notes and a website. Copies of textbooks based on the revised syllabus are also available.</P>

As previously outlined to the Deputy in my response to Question No. 661 of 9 October 2002, the abolition of fees for part-time students would have to be considered in light of the budgetary situation and in the context of other competing demands in the education system, including tackling educational disadvantage at all levels, addressing capital and equipment needs and improving support services across the system. To introduce free fees for all part-time students would be extremely costly and there are no plans at present to do so.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey): I am aware that some schools are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of fully qualified teachers.</P>
    <P>A range of initiatives to improve teacher supply have been introduced. The intake to the B Ed programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999 more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the undergraduate B Ed programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</P>
    <P>The annual intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in the 1996-97 year. Some 3,460 students are enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education.</P>
    <P>A further postgraduate course will commence in early 2003 with a projected intake of 461 students. My Department will also consult the colleges in the near future regarding the provision of modular type courses for secondary trained teachers with the necessary academic requirement in Irish.</P>
    <P>Between 2002 and 2003 it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated. These measures will help to alleviate the teacher shortage.</P>
    <P>Salary scales for different categories of workers are based on the specific duties and responsibilities of the grade and the conditions of service, all of which are taken into account in determining salary. Pay rates and conditions of service are determined through negotiations with staff side representatives.</P>

      <P>My Department has agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware the money that has been transferred to this Department from FÁS has been used, in the main, to put in place a scheme of ancillary services grants for primary schools which are not already receiving grant aid for secretarial and caretaker services under my Department's 1978-79 scheme. Scoil Míchil Naofa is already in receipt of funding for the employment of a full time secretary and caretaker under the 1978-79 scheme. I am aware, however, that the phasing out of CE schemes may result in some schools experiencing certain difficulties. In this regard, a sum of approximately &euro;2.5 million has been set aside in 2002 to respond to the particular difficulties that may be experienced by some schools. My Department has engaged a firm of consultants to examine the transitional difficulties that may be experienced by schools losing the CE personnel and to consider how those adverse effects might be ameliorated.</P>

This funding is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of these organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" />Expenditure on this scheme in 2001 amounted to &euro;8,806,218 and it is estimated that expenditure for 2002 will be in the region of &euro;9.5 million. This amount represents an increase of almost 8% on spending in 2001. There has been a steady increase in funding for the youth sector over the past five years, representing a 49% increase in spending and demonstrating the Government's commitment to supporting the work of the youth sector.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-2002, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, OPW, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>In the case of Kilkenny swimming pool, Kilkenny Borough Corporation has submitted a preliminary report in respect of this pool. This report has been examined by the Office of Public Works and the proposal is currently being considered further by my Department.

      <P>Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide. Many of the recommendations of the task force, however, require continuous development particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention. I am fully committed to supporting suicide prevention programmes and the health strategy &ldquo;Quality and Fairness A Health System for You&rdquo;, published last year, includes a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To further reduce the number of suicides it is essential that people undergoing life crises should get appropriate support. In this regard more than &euro;8 million in total has been provided since the publication of the task force report towards suicide prevention and towards research aimed at improving understanding of this issue. Additional funding has also been made available to further <Col N="577" />develop child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and to provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths by suicide, as published annually by the Central Statistics Office, are as follows &ndash; 1998 &ndash; 504, 1999 &ndash; 439, 2000 &ndash; 413, 2001 &ndash; 448.</P>
    <P>The additional resources required to continue the work in suicide prevention will be considered in the context of the overall determination of expenditure for mental health services for 2003 and subsequent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients was published in 1992 to provide guidelines for good standards of practice in acute hospitals. Its objective was to ensure that the health service is responsive to the needs of the individual patients and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services. While there was no requirement on health agencies to report regularly on their performance in implementing the charter, hospitals were expected to take account of the guidelines in order to deliver a patient-focused service.</P>
      <P>Moving to the present, one of the key guiding principles underpinning the national health strategy is the concept of people-centredness. The vision adopted for the health system of the future places a high value on treating people with dignity and respect. In pursuit of this objective, the strategy proposes the development of standardised customer services strategies by health boards to ensure a national standard and the implementation of standardised customer care plans by all service providers along with the development of a statutory framework for dealing with complaints.</P>
      <P>A number of hospitals throughout the country already operate a timed out-patient appointment system. As part of the implementation of action 85 of the health strategy, a project team has been established under the auspices of the health board executive to develop guidelines for individual timed out-patient appointments. The project team has drawn up a set of guidelines which is expected to be issued to health agencies in the near future. The guidelines will set out best practice for the implementation of a timed out-patient appointment system for hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 to 188, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons and the maintenance of waiting lists for such treatment is the statutory responsibility of the health boards/authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</P>
      <P>A grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created to address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the orthodontic service. In addition, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists this year from various health boards, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA), for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Additional funding of &euro;0.414 million was provided to the authority in 2002 for specialist training in orthodontics. These training programmes are made possible by co-operation between the health boards, the majority of consultant orthodontists and the dental teaching institutions. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</P>
      <P>In the short-term, additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Under the initiative, the ERHA was allocated &euro;2.044 million. This enabled the authority to recruit additional staff, including two consultant orthodontists and to develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital. My Department has also funded a six-chair orthodontic suite for the Northern Area Health Board, expected to be operational in spring 2003. The authority is also validating its orthodontic waiting lists as part of this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding <Col N="581" />is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The ERHA received &euro;1.815 million from the fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" />The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following information on their orthodontic waiting lists as at the end of the September 2002 quarter:</P>

    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. The number of cases treated is dependent on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. The regional chief executive has informed me that at the end of September 2002, there were 2,990 cases in orthodontic treatment in the authority's area.</P>

    <P>I regret that in the time available it was not possible to provide the information from 1992 to 1997. However, my Department will arrange for the information to be sent to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officers of the health boards have further informed me that at the end of the September 2002 quarter, there were 18,511 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,216 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001 and the objective of my Department is to further increase the number of cases in treatment. I am confident, that in co-operation with all the relevant stakeholders, namely the health boards, the Dental Council, dental hospitals, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board, all these measures combined will ensure the achievement of this objective.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.</P>
      <P>The rail link to which the Deputy refers, between Heuston Station and Connolly Stations, is routed through the Phoenix Park tunnel.</P>
      <P>The view of Iarnród Éireann is that it would not be possible, at present, to route regular suburban rail services via this tunnel without restricting existing services at Connolly Station as the Phoenix Park tunnel is very limited in capacity and there are also track capacity constraints at Connolly Station.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, also advises that the Phoenix Park tunnel is very limited in capacity and does not offer the development potential of the proposed alternative, an interconnector tunnel from Heuston Station via Pearse Station and the docklands to connect to the Maynooth and Northern lines. This latter proposal forms part of the DTO's integrated strategy for transport in the greater Dublin area for 2000 to 2016.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has recently commissioned a detailed study to look at the issue of interconnection between the Maynooth, Kildare and Northern lines, and also the potential of the Phoenix Park tunnel with &euro;1 million in funding provided by the Exchequer under the national development plan. Iarnród Éireann expects the study to be completed early next year.</P>

      <P>Formal legislative proposals for the office of the national taxi regulator are being prepared which will be brought to Government in the new year.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the office of the regulator will have a national focus and will have full effective control over the promotion of a professional, efficient and customer-friendly service by taxis, hackneys and limousines, including the overall application of standards and the licensing of taxis, hackneys and limousines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing provisions in the public service vehicle regulations require the Garda Commissioner to be satisfied that an applicant for the grant of a <Col N="584" />small public service vehicle drivers licence is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence and, in this regard, that the applicant has not been convicted of an offence which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, would render the person unsuitable to hold a licence to drive small public service vehicles. Furthermore, the Commissioner may at any time revoke a licence to drive small public service vehicles if he considers that the holder of the licence is no longer a fit and proper person to hold such a licence or if at any time during its currency the holder is convicted of an offence under section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, (dangerous driving) or of an offence which in the opinion of the Commissioner renders the person unsuitable to hold such a licence.</P>
    <P>The regulations also provide that where the holder of a licence to drive small public service vehicles is convicted of an offence which in the opinion of the court renders the holder unsuitable to hold such a licence, the court may revoke the licence and shall notify the Commissioner of any such revocation.</P>
    <P>Overcharging is an offence under the public service vehicle regulations. Those regulations also outline certain duties that are required of drivers of taxis and, since 1 September 2002, it is a condition for the grant or renewal of a taxi licence that the taxi is fitted with a taximeter printer for the purpose of printing automatic receipts for taxi fares. Enforcement of these provisions is the responsibility of the gardaí.</P>

It provides a vision of how integrated land use, the development of public transport and further infrastructure will enhance the sustainable and orderly growth of the city and its surrounding region.</P>
      <P>I understand that Cork County and City Council are putting in place arrangements to ensure effective monitoring and implementation of the plan. They include a policy committee with elected members from both the city and county council and the town councils within the CASP area. A steering committee is also being established with representatives of transport providers, Departments, semi-States and business and educational interests along with the city and county managers. These committees will be supported by a CASP office with a full-time CASP co-ordinator and other relevant staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated cost of the national roads improvement programme in construction and planning in 1999 was &euro;6.96 billion &ndash; early 1999 prices. The comparable estimated cost in January 2002 prices is &euro;15.8 billion. The increased cost of the programme is due to: some underestimation in 1999 costs which were based on updating national road needs study data; construction cost inflation in the period 1999-2001: estimated at 15% per annum in 1999 and 2000, and 9.5% in 2001; exceptional items such as the upgrade of the N9, higher land costs on the south-eastern motorway, additional costs on the Dublin Port tunnel and the inclusion of some further projects in the programme; higher land acquisition costs, particularly in Dublin and adjacent to urban areas; increased cost of environmental measures including archaeological investigation, and the availability of more accurate and detailed estimates as projects progressed from preliminary to more detailed planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investment in the programme over the period 2000-2002 will total approximately &euro;2.62 billion. <Col N="586" />Over that period: 27 projects comprising 169 km of road, including nearly 50 km of motorway/dual carriageway standard, have been completed to date and opened to traffic; work is currently continuing on a further 19 projects comprising 154.5 km of road, including 121.5 km of motorway/dual carriageway standard; 12 of these are expected to be completed and open to traffic between now and end-2003; a further 22 projects involving 224 km of road have obtained the necessary statutory approvals; planning and design work has been advanced on approximately 65 other major projects; preferred route corridors have been identified for the five main interurban routes; a large PPP programme of 11 projects has been developed of which one is in construction and four are at an advanced tender stage.</P>
    <P>Detailed information in relation to individual projects is a matter for the NRA which is responsible, in co-operation with local authorities, for the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
    <P>The increase in the cost of the programme, the changed economic and budgetary circumstances combined with some delays due, <i>inter alia</i>, to land access difficulties in 2001 affecting planning have impacted on the pace of implementation of the programme. Some projects will therefore take longer to implement than originally planned.</P>
    <P>Investment in the programme will be maintained at a high level. The 2003 provision, over &euro;1 billion, will fund: construction on major projects throughout the country such as the Dublin Port tunnel, the south-eastern motorway, major schemes on the M1 and N11, M7 Kildare bypass and major schemes in Cork and Limerick; and planning and design on other projects.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that with many projects reaching completion in 2003, and with the advance of PPP projects, that a number of schemes will be able to commence next year.</P>

      <P>The national drugs strategy sets out the Government's policy framework through which all those involved in addressing the drugs problem will work for the next seven years. The strategy provides for objectives and key performance indicators, including in the area of supply reduction. One key performance indicator is to increase the volume of opiates and all other drugs seized by 25% by end of 2004 and by 50% by end 2008, using 2000 seizures as a base. The strategy, which is published in the report entitled Building on Experience, is available for consultation in the Oireachtas Library. It may be purchased also from the Government publications sales office or from any bookseller.</P>
      <P>The strategy provides also that objectives and key performance indicators should be incorporated into the statements of strategy of relevant Departments and agencies. In this regard, a major focus of the Garda Síochána policing plan 2002 is on the implementation of the measures to achieve the objectives in the strategy relevant to the Garda Síochána. My Department's new statement of strategy will be published in the near future and will reflect the key performance indicator mentioned above.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the funding that has been made available under the equal opportunities child care programme for the development of child care services. My Department has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of child care service delivery during the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The equal opportunities child care programme was established by my Department in April 2000 as a seven year programme to increase the number of child care facilities and places in Ireland and to improve the quality of child care services. The total funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during that seven year period of the programme is &euro;437 million, of which &euro;317 million was provided under the national development plan and is co-funded by the European Union. The funding allocated through my Department's equal opportunities child care programme towards child care represents the largest amount of funding ever provided for this extremely important sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will agree, that to address the child care needs of the country it is vital that funding is wisely invested in quality child care services in a strategic manner. Any child care service that receives funding under the Department's equal opportunities child care programme must be of the highest standard and be a service that will be available and viable into the future. Where community projects are concerned they must serve the needs of the parents and children of the whole community. In many cases it is necessary to provide support to groups to enable them reach a stage where they can formulate a child care plan for their area leading to a quality proposal for funding. This development of the capacity of the sector forms a vital component of the work undertaken by my Department and ADM Limited and will be greatly advanced with the coming into being of the county child care committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 33 county/city childcare committees have been established and each committee has developed a county/city child care plan, 2001-2006, for their respective areas, based on a shared vision and analysis of the child care needs within each area. The county/city child care committees are charged with the responsibility for the effective inclusion of child care needs within the county/city development plans being drawn up by the county and city development boards. The membership of the county child care committees is representative of statutory and voluntary child <Col N="589" />care interests in each city and county area including a representative of parents and child care providers. There are no proposals to provide funding directly to local authorities from the equal opportunities child care programme. I am satisfied that the structures that have been established by my Department represent the most effective means of delivering a quality child care infrastructure that will meet the needs of parents, children and the wider community.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, also provides some funding for the provision of child care facilities in local authority housing estates. I understand that it is open to local authorities when they are constructing new social housing to provide community facilities including crèche facilities and this is usually funded as part of the capital cost of the project. The ongoing management and operational costs of such facilities is entirely a matter for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In so far as existing local authority estates are concerned I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government gave approval in April this year for the funding of ten projects involving the provision of child care facilities associated with local authority housing estates and other social housing projects. The funding of these facilities will assist in the provision of some 370 additional child care places. The implementation of the programme, including planning and execution of works, is the responsibility of the local authorities in whose areas the projects are situated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>As of yesterday there were 319 prisoners in custody for sexual offences. As has been outlined to the House on a number of occasions, there are four forms of direct therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the Irish prison system at present. These are as follows: individual counselling from the Irish Prisons Service's psychology service and from the probation and welfare service; the multidisciplinary thinking skills group work programme in Cork Prison, Arbour Hill Prison and the Curragh place of detention; the sex offender treatment programme which has been in operation in Arbour Hill Prison since 1994 and was introduced in the Curragh place of detention in 2000; and the psychiatric service which provides extensive support to prisoners in this category.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention. While it is not possible to quantify with absolute accuracy participation in all forms of rehabilitation, many of those in custody for sex offences have availed of one or more of the forms of intervention referred to above.</P>
      <P>Sixteen offenders are recruited to the sex offender programme annually &ndash; eight in Arbour Hill Prison and eight in the Curragh place of detention. As many as 94 prisoners have participated in the programme to date, of whom 84 have successfully completed it. In addition, an average of 48 offenders are recruited annually to the thinking skills course &ndash; 16 in Arbour Hill Prison, 16 in Cork Prison and 16 in the Curragh place of detention. As many as 194 offenders have completed the thinking skills course to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of offenders undergoing one to one counselling is difficult to define because of the varied nature of individual counselling provided to sex offenders in prison. This counselling <Col N="591" />can vary from one session addressing a particular problem to intensive ongoing counselling. One of the main aims of individual counselling of sex offenders is to motivate them to address their offending behaviour. In response to such counselling, many offenders, who initially might deny responsibility for their crime or deny any need for treatment, are motivated towards some process of change. For some offenders this results in their undertaking the sex offender treatment programme at Arbour Hill Prison or the Curragh place of detention. For others it results in sustained individual therapy around their offending or engagement in some other programme available in the prison system, for example, the thinking skills course group skills programme.</P>
    <P>The sex offender treatment programme takes about nine months to complete. When pre-programme and post-programme assessment is included, the timeframe for completing the programme is about 11 months. On average 10% to 20% of offenders eligible to apply for the sex offender programmes apply for them each year. Priority is given to those offenders who are closest to their release dates but who still have sufficient time left to complete the programme.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify the number of current prisoners who will ultimately participate in the sex offender programme as participation is voluntary. As I have already stated there are 16 places available on an annual basis at present. I can indicate the position in regard to the applicants for the two programmes run this year. Out of a total of 45 applicants, 16 were offered places. Of the remaining 29 the vast majority have sufficient time left in their sentence to complete the programme at a future date.</P>
    <P>In March the Irish Prisons Service published a major document in this area, an expert report on sex offender rehabilitation in Irish prisons. This report, entitled The Development of a New Multidisciplinary Sex Offender Rehabilitation Programme for the Irish Prison Service, was commissioned under the aegis of a multi-disciplinary steering group, chaired by a senior prison governor. The report's author is Dr. Francesca Lundstrom PhD, a distinguished research psychologist.</P>
    <P>The particular emphasis in this report is on laying the foundation for multi-disciplinary sex offender treatment in Irish prisons. The key word here is &ldquo;multi-disciplinary&rdquo;. This means it is intended to involve specially selected front-line prison officers in delivering such programmes in tandem with other specialist disciplines who work in our prisons, including the education service, the psychology service and the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>The report is a key document which sets out the foundation for multi-disciplinary sex offender rehabilitation in Irish prisons in the coming years. It is an earnest account of the service's ongoing activity and its future intentions. It is the basis of the service's proposals for increasing access to <Col N="592" />intensive group therapy for sex offenders from about 16 spaces every 12 months at present to more than twice that number. The report sets forth the rationale for the involvement of the full spectrum of prison staff in the work of delivery of these sex offender programmes.</P>
    <P>On reviewing the report the Irish Prisons Service has prioritised the further development and preparation of guidance materials for the implementation, delivery and management of the new multi-disciplinary sex offender programme. This entails reviewing and researching programme materials in other jurisdictions where high quality sex offender programmes are delivered and accredited to an approved standard. The intention is to design, collate and produce a full set of manuals for the delivery of a new Irish prison service multi-disciplinary sex offender treatment programme which will be firmly based on best international practice. These manuals, which are also being produced by Dr. Lundstrom, include theory manuals, as well as manuals on staff training, offender selection and sex offender programme management and evaluation. These manuals will contain the detailed requirements for delivering and supporting such programmes and the requirements needed to obtain accreditation.</P>
    <P>Following the delivery of these manuals, the Irish Prisons Service intends to commence with the special selection of prison officers and their training in the delivery of the new programme. The target for the introduction of this programme is September 2003. Initially, the new programme will be integrated into the existing programmes running in Arbour Hill and Curragh prisons before being extended to other prisons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, Garda closed circuit television schemes have been introduced, as aids to policing, in Dublin North Central, Dublin South Central, Tralee and Cork city.</P>
      <P>Subject to the availability of funds, 17 locations are also set to receive new Garda CCTV systems over the next two years. These locations are, in alphabetical order: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford. Co-funding is also a feature of Garda CCTV systems. This is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have no doubt that CCTV has made a real and positive contribution in making the streets safer for law abiding citizens, I am also conscious that the value of CCTV systems is principally as an aid to existing Garda resources. The <Col N="593" />systems must, therefore, be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures. Garda CCTV systems are not &ndash; nor are they intended to be &ndash; a replacement for gardaí on patrol.</P>
    <P>The relatively new technology of CCTV has a tremendous role to play in preventing and detecting crime. It also plays an important role in reducing the fear of crime and thereby improving the quality of life of those who live and work in areas where CCTV cameras are operational.</P>
    <P>There are also benefits to the Garda Síochána, including more effective management of resources, detection of events as they occur and filmed evidence of events. Video evidence may also lead to guilty pleas and consequent reduction in court costs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 17 locations that will receive Garda systems, contracts have been placed in relation to the CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. Work is currently ongoing in each of these locations. It is intended that the installation of cameras will commence on completion of the planning process with the relevant local authorities and the refurbishment of rooms in the different Garda stations to accommodate the CCTV monitoring rooms and associated equipment.</P>
    <P>Preparation of the detailed technical specification documents by the Garda authorities for the CCTV systems in Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford is well advanced and these are now expected to go to tender in 2003. Planning for the installation of the CCTV systems in the remaining seven areas is also scheduled to commence in 2003.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for the Garda Síochána to install CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. Some applications for CCTV systems received by the advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications, relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. To this end a grant scheme has been launched to facilitate community based groups who wish to install their own local CCTV system.</P>
    <P>Grant assistance of up to &euro;100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such schemes. It will be up to the community groups, in conjunction with the relevant local authority, to install, maintain and monitor the community based CCTV schemes. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards must be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to grant-aided systems as and when they require it.</P>
    <P>A prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant aid funding. It also outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of the <Col N="594" />prospectus are available upon request from the Garda administration division of my Department.</P>

      <P>The Irish Prisons Service is resolutely committed to tackling drug abuse in prisons in a comprehensive manner and has my full support in this. It involves a twin track approach of supply and demand reduction.</P>
      <P>The Prisons Service will continue to seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system by the education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders. An action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system was approved in 1999. This advocated a broad-based approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. The 1999 action plan, which built on an agreed policy between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the then Eastern Health Board, advocated the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug-free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. It is my intention to continue with the implementation of the action plan.</P>
      <P>The national steering group, established in 1999 to implement the action plan, continues to pursue a multi-disciplinary approach to the drugs problem with substantial input from the health sector, especially the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The group is chaired by the director of regimes in the Irish Prisons Service.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable progress in regard to the steering group's work. This includes: a drug service co-ordinator from the ERHA is now in place; and a deputy governor now has the position of training officer for drug treatment work by prison grades and has been <i>in situ</i> since October 2001. He will deliver training programmes designed to enhance and further professionalise prison officers involved in interpersonal work with prisoners undergoing drug treatment. There is now extensive access to methadone maintenance for prisoners in the Dublin area which is a complete transformation of the situation which existed up to 2000. Designated drug free wings were opened in St. Patrick's Institution in November 2000 and in Wheatfield Prison in April. Other such wings are due to open at more prisons over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The training unit in Mountjoy has been a drug-free unit since 1996. As many as 70 qualified nurses are in place to administer methadone programmes in the prisons and to monitor for any breaches of the programmes, along with their general duties. A further eight nurses are due to finish training on 6 December. They will take up <Col N="595" />duty in the prisons shortly afterwards; additional probation and welfare officers have also been authorised to work in this area. A senior probation and welfare officer and two team members have been recently assigned to drug treatment work within the Mountjoy complex; a number of other appointments are planned by the health boards in the eastern region for positions, both full-time and part-time, in the prisons in the Dublin area. These include consultant psychiatrists and addiction counsellors. Interviews to recruit the latter staff have taken place within the past month.</P>
    <P>Extensive links have been established between Cork Prison and the local drugs task force and, through funding from the latter, two full-time addiction counsellors have been appointed to work in the prison. During 2001, at the request of the director general, a special linkage group, the prison and community drugs liaison group, was established between the governors of the main Dublin prisons and voluntary sector services which work with drug dependent people in the community.</P>
    <P>Over 400 offenders have completed Mountjoy Prison's drug treatment programme. This is a six week course involving detoxification, where necessary, intensive counselling and psychological support for participants. The national steering group has recently established a multi-disciplinary working group, composed of the inhouse services and a member of the addiction studies department, Trinity College, to review the current drug treatment programme in the Mountjoy complex in terms of: the extent of ownership of the programme across a range of local stakeholders and voluntary agencies; the extent to which the programme matches current best practice; and to make relevant recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Irish Prisons Service is committed to evaluating the effectiveness of all prison programmes, including those aimed at the reduction of drug misuse. Under the National Drugs Strategy 2001 to 2008, it has undertaken to commission and carry out an independent evaluation of the overall effectiveness of the prison strategy by mid-2004. This review will cover all aspects of drug services in prisons including research on the levels and routes of supply of drugs in prisons.</P>
    <P>A number of other measures have also been implemented in recent years in an attempt to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These measures include video surveillance, improved visiting/searching facilities and increased vigilance by staff. The introduction of screened visits in Cloverhill and the Midlands Prison accompanied by the erection of nets over the yards of Cork Prison and St. Patrick's Institution has further strengthened this policy.</P>
    <P>In addition to these security arrangements, new visiting procedures are being implemented in Mountjoy Prison. These procedures were recently introduced as a means of reducing the supply of <Col N="596" />illegal drugs. Each prisoner must now indicate in advance that he expects a visit and that visitor is required to present photo identification confirming their identity. While these new procedures have met some resistance, the Irish Prisons Service is committed to eliminating the smuggling of drugs into the prison system.</P>
    <P>This Government has given a commitment as part of its programme for Government to publish a plan to end heroin use in Irish prisons. A working group is currently considering the issue of drug use in a prisons context. It will shortly formalise proposals that will form the basis of a draft plan in accordance with the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of both myself and the Irish Prisons Service to continue to place a high priority on battling the scourge of drug misuse among prisoners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>A proposal for a research project on racism in Irish prisons has been the subject of correspondence and contact between my Department and the Irish Penal Reform Trust and Amnesty International for some time.</P>
      <P>The initial application in the matter was contained in a letter of 21 September 2001 from the IPRT to the director general of the Irish Prisons Service. The director general replied on the same day expressing regret that it was not possible to facilitate the trust on that occasion. The reasons outlined were that a very similar research project was just under way and it would not be fair to people in custody to have two sets of researchers engage with them on similar research at the same time. It has since become apparent that the project proposed by the IPRT would be a joint venture with Amnesty International.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the valuable work undertaken by Amnesty International in protecting human rights throughout the world and the important contribution of the non-governmental sector in regard to research in prisons. In this particular instance I did not consider it appropriate to facilitate overlapping research projects on racism in Irish prisons and I explained my views to Amnesty International in correspondence in July and September. That correspondence indicated that the Irish prison system is already the subject of <Col N="597" />continuous scrutiny by independent national and international bodies and that the Irish Prisons Service has facilitated several recent independent research projects including, for example, studies undertaken by the IPRT on the use of segregation cells. There is no question of denying the non-governmental sector access to prisons. It is simply the case that I did not see merit in duplicating, to a significant degree, research already under way.</P>
    <P>As regards the racism research project already in progress, it is an independent project which is being conducted by the National Training and Development Institute which was selected following a publicly advertised tender competition. The purpose of the research is to provide a basis for a racism awareness programme for prison staff and prisoners. I have given an undertaking that my Department will provide Amnesty International with a copy of the completed NTDI research report as well as information, in due course, on the implementation and evaluation of the subsequent programme.</P>

The voluntary age card scheme, which is operated by the Garda, is designed to assist licence holders to comply with legislative provisions relating to underage drinking by providing evidence of age where a doubt exists. I am pleased to say that the latest figures available to me indicate that over 80,000 age cards have been issued by the Garda to date.</P>
      <P>In any proceedings against a licence holder for the sale of alcohol to an underage person, it is a defence for the defendant to prove that an age card was looked for and was produced by the person in respect of whom the charge is brought. Serious penalties, including temporary closure of licensed premises, can result where a licence holder is convicted of the offence of selling intoxicating liquor to an underage person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" />The 1999 regulations do not preclude the use of passports for proof of age purposes. For many young visitors here it may be the only form of proof of age available to them. I would encourage use of the age card wherever possible since a passport is a document primarily intended for another purpose.</P>

    <P>The Garda Síochána does all in its power to locate missing persons. On an international level the Garda liaises with Interpol and non-governmental organisations where there is a worldwide network to trace missing persons. Europol can now assist in missing persons investigations and a representative has been nominated from each EU member state for assistance and liaison in cases of suspected trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that each of the cases currently under review by Operation Trace was investigated in depth by the Garda Síochána in the locality of the disappearance and all information and leads relating to these cases are systematically analysed and followed up. Operation Trace has yielded new lines of inquiries which have been pursued in conjunction with the original investigation teams. A unique database has been devised which facilitates cross-referencing of detail and highlighting of similarities among the vast amount of information which has been collated. The Garda also have an Internet website for missing persons cases. The PULSE computer system has been specifically adapted to assist in these investigations. A national computer dental database is currently being developed in co-operation between the Garda and the national dental hospital.</P>
    <P>All files on missing persons remain open and under continuous review until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner. Many searches have taken place and further searches will be based on available information and intelligence. I am also assured that contact is maintained on a regular basis with the families of missing persons.</P>

The construction of 1,200 new prison spaces in recent years has created a situation whereby the IPS is in a position to accommodate the vast majority of prisoners for the entire duration of their sentences. The revolving door system is now largely a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases temporary release is now granted for constructive and rehabilitative reasons. For example, a prisoner may be released to attend educational and/or training programmes or courses. Another reason is to participate in work training with recognised agencies such as CERT, FÁS or PACE. The aim of this form of temporary release is to help the prisoner with employment prospects on the outside which will have the effect of reducing the risk of reoffending. In addition, short periods of temporary release to visit family members may be granted to prisoners in an effort to reduce the effects of institutionalisation and to aid familiarisation with the outside world. It should also be noted that over 20% of the prisoners on renewable temporary release are life sentenced prisoners, many of whom were released into the community some considerable time ago.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Temporary Release) Bill, 2001, has commenced Second Stage in the Dáil. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, so as to provide a clearer legislative basis for the power to grant temporary release by setting down the principles which will apply to the exercise of this power. It will provide a clear and transparent basis as well as the necessary safeguards required for the operation of the system of temporary release.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>The fact that Amnesty International and the IPRT were not facilitated recently with a proposed racism project, which was a decision taken entirely on its own merits, has no implication for either organisation in their being afforded access to prisons. I reject any suggestion that the decision in this case amounts to exclusion of either organisation from any future research or other project involving prisoners.</P>
      <P>The IPRT has been facilitated in the recent past in conducting research in prisons on the use of segregation cells which involved access to prisoners, prison staff and prison records.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of the Prisons Authority Interim Board, all applications for access to prisoners for research purposes are now being processed by a prisoner based research ethics committee which is chaired by Professor Patricia Casey. The role of the committee is to promote, encourage, support and disseminate ethically based and appropriate research within the prison service. The committee vets all such applications from the point of view of scientific merit and protection of the human rights of prisoners including privacy and personal dignity. There is no restriction placed on the IPRT or Amnesty International forwarding future research proposals to this committee.</P>

      <Col N="605" />There is very considerable accountability and independent scrutiny in place in the prison system. The Honourable Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen was appointed an inspector of prisons and places of detention on an administrative basis in April. His terms of reference are as follows: to inspect and report, as the inspector considers appropriate, to my Department on prisons and other places of detention managed on behalf of my Department by the Irish Prison Service; to report on conditions in those institutions and on the regimes in place for prisoners and detainees; to investigate and report on specific issues referred to the inspectorate by the Minister; and to submit to the Minister an annual report on the activities of the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The prison system is also subject to periodic inspection and <i>ad hoc</i> visits by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe. It is composed of lawyers, medical doctors, prison experts and parliamentarians from member states. During these visits it has the right of unimpeded access at any time of the day or night to any place where persons are detained, whether it be a prison, a Garda station or a mental hospital. The committee members are entitled to speak in private to any detained person. The committee made its third periodic visit to Ireland from 20 to 28 May and its report on the visit is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>A visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925, and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925. Their function is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison which they are appointed to and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. Visiting committees have free access either collectively or individually to every part of their prison. In inspecting prisons they focus on issues such as quality of accommodation, catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities. They also submit annual reports to me which are subsequently published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recommendations on accountability contained in the IPRT's report, entitled Toward a Model Penal System, which was published in 2001.</P>
      <P>It is always useful to receive suggestions and recommendations from non-governmental organisations. However, it should be recognised that there is very considerable accountability and independent scrutiny in place in the prison system. In April the Honourable Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen was appointed an inspector of prisons and places of detention on an administrative basis. He has been provided with accommodation and support staff. His terms of reference are as follows: to inspect and report as he considers appropriate to me on prisons and other places of detention managed on behalf of my Department by the prison service; to report on conditions in those institutions and on the regimes in place for prisoners and detainees; to investigate and report on specific issues referred to the inspectorate by me; and to submit an annual report on the inspectorate's activities to me as Minister.</P>
      <P>The Irish prison system is also subject to periodic inspection and <i>ad hoc</i> visits by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe. It is composed of lawyers, medical doctors, prison experts and parliamentarians from member states.

Committee members are entitled to speak in private to any detained person. The committee made its third periodic visit to Ireland from 20 to 28 May and its report of the visit is expected shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925, and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925. Its function is to visit, at frequent intervals, the prison which it is appointed to and hear any complaints which may be made to it by a pris<Col N="607" />oner. It reports to me any abuses observed or found by it in the prison and any repairs which it thinks may be urgently needed. It has free access, either collectively or individually, to every part of the prison. During prison inspections it focuses on issues such as quality of accommodation, catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities. It also submits annual reports to me which are subsequently published.</P>
    <P>There are no specific criteria used in selecting individuals for appointment. The composition of each committee is drawn from as wide a spectrum as possible to ensure that the needs of prisoners are understood and met. This is the longstanding practice used by successive Ministers in appointing members to the visiting committees.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the composition and proceedings of the visiting committees. They perform a very valuable service and I take this opportunity to thank them for their efforts and hard work. In the context of the consolidation and modernisation of the prison rules generally, at present under way, the rules governing visiting committees will be revised and updated where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Prisoners have a number of avenues open to them to make complaints or requests. They have access to staff, the governor, a visiting committee, my Department and the courts. Prisoners may also write to the European Commission of Human Rights and/or the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment. They may also meet officials of my Department on request to discuss any issue of concern. In the circumstances I have no plans to provide for an ombudsman for prisoners.</P>

      <P>Drogheda Borough Council recently suspended the operation of the scheme for administrative reasons, including the effect the unprecedented demand for housing loans generally was having on their staffing and financial resources. The council is due to review the matter early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1997 my Department gave approval in principle to the provision of a grant of up to £105,555.56 under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 to Killencoole Garden Compost Limited in respect of specified waste recycling facilities. This grant offer, and the subsequent payment of grant assistance, was clearly contingent on compliance by the company with the terms and conditions of the <Col N="616" />grants scheme. These included, among other things, a requirement that a grantee ensure that all legal requirements, such as planning permission and waste management regulations, were complied with and the provision of a tax clearance certificate upon request.</P>
    <P>Upon confirmation that the company had obtained planning permission and a permit under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1997, and receipt of a tax clearance certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners, a first tranche of the approved grant was paid to KGC in December 1999. From the documentation already provided by my Department the Deputy is aware that the circumstances of the approval and payment of a grant to KGC have already been thoroughly investigated.</P>
    <P>In October 2001 and January 2002 my Department received allegations linking KGC and others to the alleged unauthorised disposal of waste in the Newtowndarver area. I have no direct statutory function with regard to the oversight and regulation of waste activities. However, because KGC had received grant assistance under the OPES, it was considered appropriate, in the particular circumstances and as an exceptional measure, that my Department should investigate the substance of these allegations. An inspection of the area in question took place in early February.</P>
    <P>Arising from this inspection my Department subsequently recommended to Louth County Council that it should undertake further sampling of local watercourses to establish clearly the quality of those waters and the safety of the public water supply; establish whether there is or is likely to be a significant risk of environmental pollution arising from lands adjacent to the KGC facility; require the taking of any remedial measures considered necessary in respect of those lands; and undertake or arrange for trial excavations with a view to establishing whether hazardous waste had been disposed of in the area.</P>
    <P>It is understood that water samples were taken in February and May at a total of 11 sampling points in the Newtowndarver area, that the results show no evidence of pollution in the watercourses concerned, and that Louth County Council intends to carry out further periodic sampling of these watercourses.</P>
    <P>A geophysical survey was carried out by a private concern on behalf of the council to locate and outline the extent of possible material deposition in a site at Newtowndarver. Subsequently, the council undertook a number of trial excavations on the site. It is a matter for the council to determine whether, on foot of these investigations, further action is required having regard to its powers and functions under the Waste Management Act, 1996. A report on the investigation carried out by my Department in February will be provided to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The KGC facility is no longer in operation and the company has not, to my knowledge, been restored to the companies register. The question <Col N="617" />of recovery of grant assistance paid to KGC under the OPES will continue to be addressed in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, having regard to the respective functions of local authorities and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under the Waste Management Act, 1996, my Department will have no further direct involvement in relation to the investigation of alleged unauthorised waste activities in the Newtowndarver area.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that documentation submitted by Sligo Corporation to his Department in support of its application for grant aid under the PPP fund for local authorities 2001, indicated that the borough council in its integrated area plan for Sligo urban renewal 1999-2003, sought the provision of multi-storey car parking in the Abbey Street-Teeling Street-Chapel St.-Charlotte area; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the information was incorrect; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the members of the borough council unanimously voted to delete any provision for multi-storey parking in the area when it considered the draft integrated area plan on 22 May 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen) Martin Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>An integrated area plan for Sligo Borough Council was submitted to my Department under the urban renewal scheme for 1999 in which residential and commercial incentives, including car parks, were requested for the area referred to in the question. The IAP was subjected to detailed assessment by an independent expert advisory panel which recommended that the tax designations sought be allowed. These recommendations were accepted in full and announced in February 1999. There is no provision in the Urban Renewal Act, 1999, for subsequently varying or modifying an IAP.</P>
      <P>In November 2000 my Department received an application from Sligo Borough Council for a grant under the local authority PPP fund to undertake a feasibility study on the proposed development of lands owned by it at Abbey Street for car parking and ancillary services. This was approved in April 2001. The supporting documentation included a reference to the fact that this area had been designated for commercial reliefs, including car parks, under the urban renewal scheme. The consultants carrying out the feasibility study are due to report to the council by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>My Department has no record of the council voting to amend the IAP for this area on 22 May 2000.</P>

      <P>The new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established in June and entailed the transfer of various functions into and out of it. Consequently, a number of issues need to be reconciled in the next few weeks before we can forecast year end outturns with a reasonable degree of confidence.</P>
      <P>We anticipate that expenditure across Vote 42 at the end of 2002 will broadly reflect amended Estimates. It is envisaged that most of the savings that are likely to arise on individual sub-heads will be offset by an expected shortfall in appropriations-in-aid and by reallocations to other programmes of my Department where extra resources are needed.</P>

      <P>My Department's Estimates for 2003 have provided for an additional &euro;18.1 million in respect of expenditure on rent and mortgage interest supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme over and above the expected outturn for 2002. This represents an increase of 7.2%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All applicants for rent or mortgage interest supplement are currently required to contribute <Col N="620" />a minimum of &euro;7.62 per week towards their accommodation costs. This level was set in 1994 and represented about 10% of the SWA personal rate at that time. As I announced recently, the minimum contribution is being restored to approximately 10% of the minimum social welfare payment which is &euro;12.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to amend the sources of income that are disregarded for rent or mortgage interest supplement from those advised to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 223 on 21 November.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently introduced regulations setting out the maximum rent levels. These will be used as the basis for calculating the amount of rent and mortgage interest supplement payable to various family sizes. I will arrange to have details of the levels appropriate to the different family sizes across all health boards made available to the Deputy.</P>
