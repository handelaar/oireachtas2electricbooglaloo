      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Connaughton. I call on Deputy Connaughton to state the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following important matter: the lay-off of 14 workers out of a total workforce of 28 at the Hi Tech factory at Mountbellew, Ballinasloe, County Galway, this week; and given that there is no industrial project in the town to seek the help of the IDA and the Government in attracting an industry to the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 22<i>b</i>, motion re Referral to Joint Committee of Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Act, 2001 <Col N="2" /> (Commencement) Order, 2002; No. 22<i>c</i>, motion re Co-operation with Tribunal &ndash; Deputy Liam Lawlor; No. 4, Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 5, Disability Bill &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 22<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate and the proceedings of No. 22<i>c</i> shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 50 minutes and the following arrangement shall apply: (i) the speeches shall be confined to the following Members, who may share time: the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the leaders of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Green Party and they shall be called upon in that order; (ii) speeches may not exceed ten minutes in each case.</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House. The first is the proposal to deal with No. 22<i>b</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Order of Business still stands as scheduled in view of the fact that Deputy Lawlor's legal team is in <Col N="3" /> the High Court seeking an injunction against the debate proceeding? As I came into the House I was told &ndash; I am not sure if it is true but perhaps the Taoiseach will confirm it &ndash; that the court has issued an order to release Deputy Lawlor to attend the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we deal with the first proposal? The second proposal deals with the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Order of Business cannot proceed on the basis that we cannot have the debate immediately afterwards we need to know now. If the Order of Business in its entirety has to be redrafted I am in order to raise this matter on the first item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hypothetical at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is hypothetical we will agree the first proposal without debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first proposal is agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22<i>c</i>, motion re Co-operation with Tribunal &ndash; Deputy Liam Lawlor, agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir. In the absence of clarification, it is a fact that Deputy Lawlor and his lawyers are in the High Court this morning doing what I predicted would happen on Tuesday if we proceeded with a debate in the absence of the Deputy. There is a story now that the court has decided he should attend the debate and he is being released. Will the Taoiseach indicate if that is the case and, if so, are we in a position from a time point of view to take the motion immediately after the Order of Business in circumstances where I presume if the Deputy is to attend the House some time will have to be made to arrange to bring him here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only factual information I have is that I was informed shortly after 9.30 a.m. that the legal representatives of Deputy Lawlor were due to go into the High Court at 10.30 a.m. to seek his release. There is a rumour that has not been confirmed to me that the High Court has in the past four or five minutes made that decision but I cannot confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the House be adjourned until the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in a position to attend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not in the High Court. I am in the hands of the legal officer who advises the House. The House may wish to adjourn for ten to 15 minutes to ascertain if the rumour is correct, or to ascertain if it is correct to hold a debate while the case is ongoing. I checked with the Chief Whip and the legal advice to the <Col N="4" /> House is that it is in order for a debate to proceed even if a case is ongoing because the House can deal with its business in any event. However, if the High Court has released Deputy Lawlor I assume it would be a courtesy to a Member of the House to wait until the Member attends. That is a matter for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to confirm the Taoiseach's remarks. It is my understanding that the House is master of its own destiny in relation to its procedures and that if the court in its wisdom decides to release Deputy Lawlor on a temporary basis so that he can attend the debate then no doubt this side of the House will accommodate him. However, he could have avoided all of this had he in the first instance complied with the requirements of the court and the tribunal which he had a part in establishing. We should proceed. If Deputy Lawlor arrives here by white Hiace van or any other mode of transport then, he can, no doubt, be accommodated. The real solution to this problem is for him to obey the rule of law and to get on with the business of co-operation with the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is great stuff. If the High Court has decided to release Deputy Liam Lawlor this morning it would have had to do so for a legal or constitutional reason. That reason must be founded on considerations of natural justice. It would be imprudent to go ahead until we know what happened in the High Court this morning. Was the Government represented in court this morning by an officer of the Attorney General's office or somebody briefed by the Attorney General or was the House represented?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The court of public opinion will give the Attorney General the same answer as the High Court has given him this morning on his legal advice. Was the House represented? The Taoiseach said he was relying on the advice of the legal officer of the House. Was the House represented this morning in court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal officer to the House is not answerable to me but the legal advice of the officer of the House for the past three days and his office has looked at this quite seriously &ndash; it is also the Attorney General's view but the Attorney General is not a legal adviser to the House &ndash; is that the House can order its business. If the House wishes to discuss any matter the House can discuss that matter. This is not a court, this is not a jury. This is the assembly of the <Col N="5" /> people and if we wish to debate something we debate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any more information this morning that he could impart to the House on the difficulties experienced by AIB in Baltimore? I understand there is a mechanism in the United States where banks which are deposit holders for the Federal Reserve are indemnified against fraud if a person is subsequently convicted for fraud. Will he confirm if this is the case and that the AIB subsidiary in Baltimore would be a beneficiary of this arrangement with the Federal Reserve or if it is outside of that arrangement? Will he also inform the House if he and the Tánaiste have yet evaluated the possible damage to our inward investment programme from the United States arising from this. In circumstances where there are only two major banks here and if there is any doubt over the efficacy of the biggest bank in the country, obviously there are considerations which affect inward investment particularly by American companies who will be familiar with what has happened because of the huge publicity given to this event in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that I have a family connection with the bank in question. Has the Taoiseach consulted the Minister for Finance on this matter? Has the Minister for Finance had any contact with the Governor of the Central Bank, which is the regulatory authority for the parent bank AIB Dublin? Subject to whatever discussions the Taoiseach may have <Col N="6" /> with the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank, it would be appropriate and proper that at some stage today when more information is available, the Minister for Finance would come into the House and make a statement outlining the position and the implications for the parent bank here in Ireland in relation to its standing and the position of any shareholders and, more importantly, any depositors or creditors of the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on what I said yesterday and the discussions here yesterday, developments overnight have been monitored closely by the Department of Finance but they have not changed the basic information which was available to us yesterday. The Department of Finance has been in touch with the Central Bank on this matter and, as confirmed yesterday, the Minister has had a meeting with the Governor of the Central Bank. It is clear that AIB bank, the US banking regulators who have the immediate responsibility for supervision of the US subsidiary concerned, and the Central Bank which regulates on a consolidated basis will all wish to investigate what happened in a detailed way. That is currently happening, no doubt, with a view to seeing what lessons have to be learned from this extraordinary and worrying situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has also asked the Central Bank to report to him in the light of the outcome of its investigation. The Central Bank has already sent senior Central Bank officials to the United States to see whether any changes in the legislative or administrative provisions governing bank supervision might be required. To reply to Deputy Noonan, the investigation would be under the regulatory system of the American authorities and that is what would govern the investigations. They will co-operate fully with and keep the Central Bank informed.</P>
      <P>I remind the House we are not aware of any long-term threat to the bank concerned. I raised the issue yesterday about its liquidity. We have been advised that AIB's capital position is strong and is comfortably within the established limits. There is no threat to account holders or to the solvency of the bank. I am aware that a team of experts from the Federal Reserve has been sent in to investigate this issue at senior level because of the enormity of it. AIB senior officials from here along with the Central Bank officials are also there. There has been agreement that they will all consult each other. At each stage of the investigation from the American officials from the Federal Reserve, from the Central Bank and from AIB they will keep us informed. The appropriate bodies are fully investigating the matters. There is no other information. On the issue of whether there is more involved, I have no further data on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach establish and inform the House if AIB's subsidiary in Baltimore was carrying indemnity against fraud sub<Col N="7" /> ject to a successful conviction being achieved and that this indemnity was in place by the Federal Reserve? Will he further establish and inform the House, if this is not so, were they carrying any insurance against fraud? We are in circumstances where there are 31,000 employees at AIB, there are 98,000 shareholders and a myriad of customers. The shares being actively traded in the market is relevant information whether they were carrying an indemnity against fraud. There is an obligation on the Central Bank though the Minister for Finance to put that information in the public domain if it has such information and if not to deny it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information but the House would want it to make its position clear on that matter. I would have a view on what I imagine are the rules but I do not know and I do not want to speculate on its position. I will make the view of the House known to the Central Bank and ask that it clear up that matter since it has been raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two days ago I raised with the Taoiseach the situation which my colleague, Deputy Shortall, had raised with the Minister for Education and Science. I will remind him of the content of the matter. On 4 and 12 December, Deputy Shortall on behalf of the Labour Party asked the Minister for Education and Science if he would publish the list of 850 schools whose applications for capital grants in relation to various types of improvement and extension and development were with the educational unit in Tullamore. She asked that the list be published in order that all the parents, pupils and teachers concerned would be informed of their respective school's position on the waiting list for the substantial amount of moneys voted by the House. The Minister undertook to publish it. As it was not published before Christmas, on 31 January the Deputy renewed her request, but I understand the Minister again failed to publish it.</P>
      <P>The Minister answers many questions in his unique style which, to those of us familiar with him, means clarity compounded with opacity in an extraordinary manner. Deputies, parents and teachers do not know where the applications made by their schools stand on the list. During visits to numerous schools I have been constantly told that the school concerned wants to know its position on the list.</P>
      <P>I will repeat the question for the benefit of the Taoiseach. Will he direct the Minister for Education and Science to publish the list, which is in his possession, in the archives and on the desks of civil servants in Tullamore, in order that each of the 850 schools can ascertain its position with regard to its application for funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 850 schools involved. The processing of these projects has been stopped on the direction of the Minister for Education <Col N="8" /> and Science, Deputy Woods, despite the capital allocation for schools and school buildings contained in the Estimates for 2002. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the money is being hoarded until the election is called to facilitate a series of election announcements about the repair and building of schools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Hundreds of projects are under way. I will raise Deputy Quinn's point with the Minister and ask him to make available the information in his possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not disputing the amount of money being voted by the House, which is not drawn from Fianna Fáil funds, but paid for by taxpayers. We simply ask that citizens are informed of where their school stands on the list. I suggest that someone in the Taoiseach's media monitoring unit examine the matters raised on the Adjournment and inform the Taoiseach of their content if his backbenchers have not already done so. The dominant issue is frequently schools.</P>
      <P>Today's newspapers contain an example of the problem. A new building for a primary school in Aghinagh outside Macroom, County Cork was sanctioned in 1998 by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin. An article in the <i>Irish Independent, </i>under the byline of Olivia Kelleher, states:</P>
      <P>The 26 pupils are taught in two classrooms which are separated only by a partition. School Principal, Diarmuid Ó Céileachair, has to lay traps for vermin every winter and spends the summer holidays carrying out repairs to the building . . . Planning permission was granted for the school last March and a site was purchased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to notes. The chairperson of the parents' association said the project has stalled in recent months, which is precisely the point I make. Every one of the 850 projects <Col N="9" /> has been stalled notwithstanding the amount of money voted by the House for the capital programme. Will the Taoiseach direct the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the Secretary General of his Department to publish the list in full in order that all Members are informed of the position? This would also ensure Members on the Fianna Fáil backbenches would no longer have to raise schools issues on the Adjournment.</P>

We have sought a debate in order that the House can unanimously pass a motion condemning Deputy Liam Lawlor and calling on him to resign as a Deputy, but when this was first mentioned he went on the airwaves and said he would make allegations against Deputies in the House. The Taoiseach's proposal is not sufficient to amend the order to allow five leaders, and Deputy Lawlor, to speak if in the course of his speech he makes allegations against Deputies in the House&mdash;</P>

In the legislative programme the Government has published for this session publication of the ground rent Bill to abolish ground rents is expected in mid-2002. Mid-2002 is the end of June. The Government, I hope, will be gone at that stage and it will not have brought forward the legislation to abolish this relic of landlordism and imposition on ordinary householders throughout the country which causes grave disquiet. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, in answer to a direct question from me on 13 December when taking the Order of Business on behalf of the Taoiseach, told me that the Bill would come before the Dáil early in 2002. The Taoiseach clarified for me at Question Time before Christmas that there were no constitutional issues outstanding. Therefore, that was not a problem. When will the Bill come before the Dáil and will the Government honour the promises it has made that it will abolish this relic of landlordism?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, having regard to the con<Col N="20" /> tent of the motion passed unanimously by the House on 30 January 2001,</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, given the sentence of the High Court, structured as it was to elicit full co-operation within a definite timeframe and the fact that the judge referred to his membership of Dáil Éireann, that Deputy Lawlor should now fully meet the requirements of the courts and the tribunal or, that failure to do so within that timeframe would confirm his membership of Dáil Éireann to be untenable and that he should voluntarily resign his membership,</P>
    <P>now notes and deplores the Deputy's continued failure to provide the co-operation sought by the tribunal, which was established by the unanimous decision of Dáil Éireann, and regards such failure as confirmation that his membership of Dáil Éireann is untenable and is of the opinion that he should accordingly voluntarily resign his membership.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is aware of the contents of Deputy Lawlor's letter to Party Whips of 5 February 2002.</P>
    <P>Irish politics is undergoing a period of profound change. The uncovering of a previously hidden and unacceptable past in our political life has severely undermined public confidence in politics and politicians. The Government, and indeed all parties, determined that there should be a comprehensive examination of all alleged wrongdoing. For politics to recover the confidence of the people, the facts must be laid bare and the appropriate lessons must be learned. Politics was not the first area of our national life to come under the spotlight. The succession of revelations about many areas of Irish life, previously held in largely uncritical esteem, has contributed to a profoundly changed atmosphere for public life in Ireland. I am talking about public life in the broadest sense, not just politics. An increasingly confident and critical public rightly demands that its affairs are administered in an open way and to the highest standard.</P>
    <P>All people in politics, particularly those of us who have the honour of serving in the Government of this Republic, have a solemn duty to make good the high aspirations of our people. The past must be accounted for and those who have transgressed must face justice as prescribed by the laws framed in accordance with the Constitution. For the present, we who hold office now must conduct ourselves in a way that honours the democratic mandate with which we have been entrusted. For the future, we must ensure that public life is ordered to make it as difficult as is humanly possible to repeat the excesses of the past. Furthermore, we must provide for the swift administration of justice for any transgressions in the future. The Government proposed, and the House agreed unanimously, to the establishment of the tribunals so that past events could be <Col N="21" /> uncovered. This is necessary for its own sake and essential in building confidence in public life for the future.</P>
    <P>This is an obligation that bears especially on those who hold public office. Deputy Lawlor has on three occasions been found by the High Court to be in breach of his duty to co-operate with the Flood tribunal. On three occasions he has been committed to prison. Political life is cheapened by these events. Cynicism about public life is fed by the spectacle that has surrounded these proceedings. Most importantly, the work of the tribunal established unanimously by the Oireachtas, including Deputy Lawlor, is frustrated. This is wrong and unacceptable. This, as set out in the motion before the House, makes Deputy Lawlor's membership of Dáil Éireann untenable and I believe, accordingly, that he should voluntarily resign his membership of this House. We, in this House, must honour the trust of the people who elected us. As an elected member of Dáil Éireann, Deputy Lawlor has a particular duty to uphold the law.</P>
    <P>The tribunals are established by the unanimous democratic will of the people's elected representatives. Their work represents the national will on an issue of the highest importance, namely the conduct of our public life. In this Republic nobody is above or below the law. There is no untouchable caste. Every citizen is accountable. When a citizen holds public office, there is an additional duty to lead by example. At a minimum, there is an onus not to bring the administration of public affairs into disrepute. Deputy Lawlor has repeatedly failed to live up to the standard that might reasonably be expected of a Dáil Deputy.</P>
    <P>We should be clear that Dáil Éireann is not a court. We cannot and should not sit in judgment. In this case, judgment has been made in the courts on three occasions. It is on foot of those judgments and in the light of our political responsibility that Dáil Éireann now draws its political conclusion and arrives at the view that Deputy Lawlor's position is untenable. In making our view known, we do not seek to interfere with or override the inalienable right of the sovereign people to elect the members of the Legislature. We do, however, seek to exercise leadership and remove even the possibility of ambiguity in relation to the duty of every citizen to the tribunals. That duty is clear, it is to co-operate with the lawful orders of the tribunals.</P>
    <P>Today is both a sad and a good day for politics. It is saddening that this unprecedented step must be taken and it is not being taken lightly. It is good, however, that events have moved to the point that the tribunals, having been established, are doing their work and dealing effectively with the obstacles they find in their path as provided for in the legislation introduced by the Government. Specifically, and for the first time, this provided for the punishment of imprisonment for any person who fails to obey the lawful orders of the tribunal. The law is working. We have not <Col N="22" /> only prescribed higher standards but also provided for serious punitive consequences. The light at the end of the tunnel is that politics is again being seen to work.</P>
    <P>We must consider these events in context. The Government has initiated the most far-reaching inquiries not only in the history of this State but in the recent history of most democratic countries. In Government we have established the following tribunals: Moriarty, to inquire into payments to politicians; Flood, to inquire into irregularities in the planning process; Lindsay, to inquire into the contamination of blood products; Costello, to inquire into Ansbacher accounts; Dunne, to inquire into organ retention in our hospitals; Blaney, to inquire into irregularities at National Irish Bank; Murphy, to inquire into abuse in swimming; and Laffoy, to inquire into childhood abuse. We are determined to find the truth, whatever it is. We are determined to deal with all the issues from all the tribunals, however numerous and complex they are. The Government is committed to restoring confidence in public life.</P>
    <P>We believe, as do Deputies on all sides of the House, that politics is about the service of others. In this Republic, elected office is the highest honour any citizen can achieve. Through various tribunals and inquiries, we have learned and will continue to learn the truth. Through the unprecedented legislation proposed by this Government and enacted by the Oireachtas, we will apply the lessons learned. In the life of this Government we have completely and radically overhauled the legislative basis for public affairs in Ireland and have enacted one of the strictest regulatory regimes anywhere. We have laid the foundations for a new beginning in Irish political life. However, we must first deal with unfinished business. We must ensure that the tribunals run their course and that their work is successfully completed. It is only by learning the lessons of history that we can hope to avoid repeating them and only by enforcing accountability that we can hope to provide credibility in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor has let down politics repeatedly. I, therefore, commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Just over one year ago we stood in this Chamber debating a motion on Deputy Lawlor. I began my address on that occasion by saying it was with deep regret this House should find itself having to debate such a matter. I said it was a sad day for the House and a sad day for Deputy Lawlor and his family, and I repeat those comments today. Some 12 months on, it is with even deeper regret that we find ourselves back here on the same subject. I have particular sympathy for Deputy Lawlor's wife Hazel and his family. In my view they have been subjected to excessive and unfair media exposure during the past year and over the past two months in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> This is an even more serious matter than it was 12 months ago. It is deeply disturbing that the statutory instrument devised by this House to investigate planning and related matters has been flouted to such a flagrant extent by Deputy Liam Lawlor. Mr. Justice Smith, in delivering his ruling last Friday in the High Court, said Deputy Lawlor by his conduct had compounded his contempt and was in disregard of orders of the tribunal and the court. The House would do well to commend the actions of Mr. Justice Flood and the planning tribunal legal team on the manner in which they are conducting the ongoing inquiry and for their unswerving resolve in attempting to uncover the truth behind these matters. The tribunals that have been set up have been doing their job well. The Flood tribunal, in particular, has confounded its sniping critics by proving with persistence and determination it can root out the truth as it has been mandated to do by this House.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the success of the tribunals, which I am confident we shall see, may be of such importance that we may no longer need their like again. They should have the deterrent effect in the first instance, to signal that our democracy means business when it comes to fairness, openness and standards in public life. The fact that the tribunals, particularly the Flood and Moriarty tribunals are uncovering unsavoury information should give us some degree of satisfaction that they are working well. Public accountability has been greatly enhanced by the tribunals, painful and shocking though the information they uncover has been. The effectiveness of the tribunals has been damaged and the cost to the taxpayer increased, not by anything the tribunals have done but by the evasiveness and lack of co-operation that too many witnesses have shown. The public is rightly eager to hear the considered reports of the members of the tribunal at the appropriate time. The public wants to see results. I am sure Deputies will agree that it is the public duty of those called on to give evidence to the tribunals to co-operate fully and speedily so that the answers the public so clearly wants and deserves can be given.</P>
    <P>The requirements of due process, natural justice and constitutional order govern us all and are things to which the vast majority of us hold. We must hold ourselves to these standards in public life. Although it is the case that in other jurisdictions a member may be removed by parliament, I agree with the thrust of our Constitution that it is ultimately a matter for the electorate to remove a Member and not for his fellow Members. The sovereignty of the people is sacrosanct, not simply as an aspiration but as a practical matter with particular consequences. We in this House cannot allow ourselves to forget this fundamental fact. It is this that drives all our efforts to ensure accountability through the Oireachtas to the public. We are but a conduit for accountability to the public. We cannot in this instance cause the removal of a Member of the <Col N="24" /> House permanently by our will alone. While we can and do sanction Members for unparliamentary behaviour, and there is scope for us to examine how extending the rules under which we do so may serve to encourage greater standards in the discharge of public duties, we ought to restrain ourselves from seeking to cause the removal of a sitting Deputy. The dangers that would arise were our Constitution not to prevent the removal of a Member by other Members of the House are evident to all of us. Such powers would be open to abuse by the majority position in this House.</P>
    <P>Since this matter last arose in the House, I have been greatly encouraged by the work done by the Oireachtas Committee on Members' Interests in bringing forward a code of conduct which will govern Members of both the Dáil and Seanad. I understand it will be before this House very soon. I note also the recent signing into law of the Standards in Public Office Act, 2000, which will among other things require tax clearance certificates from all candidates prior to election.</P>
    <P>At this juncture we must ask what is the appropriate course of action for the House, given Deputy Lawlor's unacceptable behaviour <i>vis-à-vis</i> a tribunal established by the Oireachtas. Should the House seek to use its moral influence effectively to procure his resignation? Any moral influence the House possesses depends as much on Deputy Lawlor's own attitude to the opinion of the House as on the collective view of Members. In so far as the House can bring any moral influence to bear, it should be applied towards the goal of procuring Deputy Lawlor's full compliance with the tribunal. He should do this in the spirit of accountability to the public that informed the decision of the Oireachtas to establish the tribunals in the first place. Once again I urge Deputy Lawlor in the strongest possible terms to follow this course with a change of heart and to let us see that borne out in his actions in the near future. That has to be the goal of this House since we cannot collectively ensure his resignation from the House, no matter how much the House or its Members desire it or feel it to be the honourable course of action.</P>
    <P>I recognise, however, that as far as the House is concerned, its primary objective as a constituent part of the Oireachtas should be to promote compliance by its Members with the requirements of the tribunals which we established. It is appropriate that the House should express a collective view that we deplore his failure to co-operate with the Flood tribunal and that he should voluntarily resign his membership of Dáil Éireann. That is as far as we can go. We cannot force any Member to resign. Our resolutions on the matter of resignation of a Member in whatever circumstances, and no matter who the Member is, will always have to stop at the point of moral influence.</P>
    <P>We are here as Deputies of this House. We are called Deputies because we are here to deputise for the people. Deputy Lawlor is deputising for <Col N="25" /> the people of Dublin West in Dáil Éireann. It is the people who will ultimately decide whether Deputy Lawlor will sit in Dáil Éireann. This is a fundamental democratic principle with which we have no right to interfere. We must all have absolute confidence in this process, as I do.</P>

      <P>Like everybody else in this House I deplore the behaviour of Deputy Liam Lawlor and the impact of his behaviour on the public perception of politics and on our political institutions. It is my view that his membership of the Dáil has for some time been untenable and damaging to politics and that he should resign.</P>
      <P>However, I was concerned on Tuesday that the debate to take place in the House today calling for his resignation should be orderly and accord with our constitutional obligations. I regret that when I raised in the House on Tuesday the necessity for Deputy Lawlor's presence, my concerns were dismissed by the Taoiseach and widely rubbished outside the House in both official and unofficial briefings to the media. If the Attorney General had taken more time in considering the approach to this debate rather than focusing on his election ambitions, perhaps the Government would have got better advice and this House would not have been subject to the fiasco it was subject to this morning.</P>
      <P>When the Flood tribunal was put in place by order of this House, it had full approval in this House and it had full public approval. The initial evidence was dramatic. The evidence given by former Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, was riveting and there was great public interest in the procedures of the tribunal. Now, unfortunately, three years later with little progress being reported to this House, people are beginning to lose interest and faith in the tribunal process. Part of the reason people are losing faith in the Flood tribunal is the long delays which have been experienced by the tribunal in getting to the core issues. These delays have been caused, to a very large extent, by the obstruction carried on by certain witnesses, and in particular by the obstruction of Deputy Liam Lawlor. He has played ducks and drakes with the tribunal and has brought about a situation where unwarranted delays have been caused. He has brought this House into disrepute by his actions and he has failed completely to assent to the unanimous will of this House that everybody should co-operate with the tribunal process and in particular with the Flood tribunal. In doing so he has brought about a situation where the House's reputation for incompetence and ineffectiveness has been magnified.</P>
      <P>Despite the Taoiseach's fine words this morning and on many other occasions, the Taoiseach has a case to answer. Last June, Mr. Justice Flood requested additional judges be appointed to the tribunal; to date the Taoiseach has failed to comply with that request and the Government has failed to appoint the judges that are necessary to proceed with the proper workings of the tribunal.</P>

      <Col N="26" /> Not long ago a member of the Aer Rianta board facilitated the passage of Deputy Lawlor through Dublin Airport. That person is still a member of the Aer Rianta board. What we have here is the continuing exercise of the Taoiseach's ineffectiveness and ambiguity when there is public denunciation of the Deputies on his side of the House that got into difficulty. This public denunciation is matched by private accommodation. The Taoiseach is quite prepared to continue in an ambiguous fashion where public denunciation by him and others in his Administration is run in parallel with private accommodation of Deputies who have been expelled from his party but to whom he still extends the privileges and friendships of the party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Liam Lawlor played ducks and drakes with the tribunals and the courts. The Taoiseach allowed him, by not taking the advice that was freely proffered to him on Tuesday, to play ducks and drakes again this morning with this House and to bring the House into further disrepute.

      <P>The Taoiseach must be seriously embarrassed this morning to be forced by the courts to vindicate the rights of a Member of this House. It was self-evident that Deputy Lawlor would be accorded the right to attend here under the constitutional rights of natural justice. One did not need to be a constitutional lawyer to know that. The famous man from <i>Dublin Opinion</i> on the Donnybrook bus could have told the Taoiseach that. Any man on a high stool in a bar knows there are constitutional rights and a right to be heard. Yet, the Taoiseach has allowed a situation where the courts again had to dictate to the House how it should proceed and the right of Deputy Lawlor to be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why can the Taoiseach not uphold the constitutional rights of this House and why does he <Col N="27" /> continually, through his inactivity, ambiguity and incompetence, drag this House into disrepute? He has had five years to clean up politics and yet, through the methodology of his management, everything continues to be shrouded in ambiguity. We continue in this House, under its Leader, the Taoiseach, to fail to address the key issues. In the meantime, cynicism outside this House continues to rise. Young people look at us with contempt.

      <P>This is both a good day and a bad day for this Republic. It is a good day because, in one sense, it shows us trying to struggle with the problems of coming of age. It is a bad day because, unprecedentedly, we have to ask someone who like the rest of us has the honour to be elected to this House to voluntarily resign. In the march to freedom for this nation, there were many people who said we could never govern our own affairs. The great colonialist myth was that we were not up to it, could not handle it and were ungovernable. This nation has to demonstrate that we have the strength of character, the generosity of spirit and the humanity to govern our own affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the honour of being elected on the same day in June 1977 as Deputy Lawlor. I, and I suspect Deputy Lawlor, can still remember that extraordinary sense of exhilaration, honour and pride at being elected to take my place in this sovereign assembly of a sovereign people, to make laws for ourselves, to hold Governments to account, to attack from Opposition, to sit in office, to make decisions and, yes, to make mistakes, to do things one might regret, to face the electorate subsequently, to be defeated and to be <Col N="28" /> elected again. That is the very stuff of democratic politics, the very reality that becomes a passion in one's adult life, a passion that has driven me all my lifetime. Looking around the world, we see people queuing for 24 hours in South Africa &ndash; for what? They queue to vote to elect a person who will represent them and who will, as Deputy Harney said, be their Deputy in a sovereign assembly, who will honour the trust of the ballot box and who will attempt, with all the frailty of our human condition, to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>Today, we in this House have to do the right thing. In all my time in this House I have never seen a motion calling on a colleague to voluntarily resign, signed by the leaders of all parties in the House. It is without precedent. This is, as I said, a good and a bad day. It is a good day for us, but it is a bad day for the person we are asking to renounce the trust that was placed in him by the electorate. Why is this necessary? It is because the courts of this land, which are separate and independent of this House, have deemed not once but on three occasions that a Member of this House who voted for or did not oppose the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry into the misconduct of affairs &ndash; apparently so &ndash; had declined or refused to give the level of co-operation that is expected of every citizen. That happened three times. Today, we are asking a Member of this House to voluntarily resign. This is a Republic. We cannot force people to act but what we are asking this person to do is unprecedented. We are not doing this for party political advantage. It is not, on this occasion, because my party disagrees totally with other parties in this House. It is not because, as a political leader, I have severe reservations about the conduct of affairs by the present Administration. It is because the very foundations of this democracy and the trust in which we are all held are being undermined by the cynical refusal of an elected Member to co-operate with our courts. That is what we are being asked to do. It is without precedent to have a motion signed by the five leaders before us.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal to Deputy Lawlor, notwithstanding anything that has been said in the past or the interviews he has given to the media or individual journalists, to do the last thing he can &ndash; invoking the memory he must have had in June 1977 when he had the honour to be elected to this House &ndash; to respect the traditions of this State and venerate the memory of the people who came before us, namely to acquiesce without protest to our request that he voluntarily resign from this House and, by so doing, reinforce the foundations of this Republic.</P>

    <P>For the third time in a year, Deputy Liam Lawlor has been sent to jail. That no sanction exists to require Deputy Lawlor to resign his Dáil <Col N="29" /> seat is a matter of huge annoyance to many, including Members of this House. That lack of sanction must be addressed and debated. I propose the introduction, as a minimum sanction, of suspension without pay.</P>
    <P>However, deeper concerns regarding this case are being expressed. How can a backbench TD like Deputy Lawlor contemplate the enormous legal costs which have already been incurred by his reckless challenges to the work of the tribunal and appeals to decisions of the courts? It is not unusual for a Deputy to have employment outside Dáil Éireann even though it is not a good idea. However, Deputy Lawlor's money-making activities outside Leinster House are, as far as we can tell, quite extraordinary and require far more rigorous investigation. In this regard, it is scandalous that Mr. Justice Flood's request to Government for personnel to assist his tribunal has not been met as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced the Government has the stomach for this investigation given that it may drag in other individuals. Deputy Lawlor's background is not very different from that of many current members of Fianna Fáil. It is clear that the philosophy of Mr. Charles J. Haughey &ndash; often paraphrased as &ldquo;money and power at all costs&rdquo;&ndash; was an important inspiration in attracting Deputy Lawlor, the Taoiseach and many others in Government, into politics. It appears Deputy Lawlor opted for the money and the Taoiseach opted for the power. Ironically, had Deputy Lawlor been as skilful an accountant as the Taoiseach he might not have ended up in his lonely prison cell, temporarily released to attend this debate in which we are calling for his resignation.</P>

      <P>The current difference between the price of agricultural land and land zoned for development presents enormous temptation for profiteering and corruption. As a former member of Dublin County Council in the early 1990s, I felt the culture of corruption and profiteering in the air but it was very difficult to prove. The advice from planners to councillors not to make bad rezoning decisions was shamefully disregarded by a coalition of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members in the main over and over again. To this date, those of us outside that golden circle can only imagine the resulting levels of profiteering for developers and speculators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Councillors will deny they were paid money to help them make up their minds on how they should vote. On 19 February 1993 when I asked, as an unrelated aside to the specific proposals on the agenda that day, whether councillors had at <Col N="30" /> any time received gifts or money to influence their vote, and when I displayed an unsolicited cheque of a mere £100 which was sent to my party, uproar ensued. Upon resuming my seat, I was physically assaulted and had to be escorted from the chamber, following suspension of the meeting, allegedly for my own safety.</P>
    <P>The dealings of Deputy Lawlor and, I suspect, others may have been facilitated by a system which lacks traceability and which must be opened up to scrutiny. A system of traceability in all transactions is needed and the introduction of a windfall tax to return a share of the profit from rezoning decisions to the community at large would be an important measure of reform to aid those who might otherwise be open to temptation and find themselves the focus of debates such as this.</P>
    <P>Traceability of financial transactions would help ensure honesty in politics and public life generally and could also help to prevent the type of monumental fraud which topically has rocked AIB and the financial world in general. To this extent, the allegations against Deputy Lawlor and Mr. John Rusnak cannot be treated in total isolation. International financial transactions would have to be subject to systems of traceability if a Tobin tax, as proposed by the Green Party, on each international financial transaction were in force. Even a 1% or 0.5% tax would be a major bonus if paid to the poorest people of this earth who make up what aid agencies call the majority world.</P>
    <P>The majority should have a say regarding global justice and the majority in Dáil Eireann should be heeded. In this regard, the Green Party joins with all parties in this House in calling for the resignation of Deputy Liam Lawlor. I call on the Deputy to heed that request.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has hung Deputy Liam Lawlor out to dry here today and so he should but what he conveniently did not say is that Deputy Lawlor did not act in a vacuum over the course of the past 20 or 25 years in public life. It is appropriate that Deputy Lawlor is sitting on the Fianna Fáil benches today because for 20 years he has been a public representative for the Fianna Fáil Party as a Dublin county councillor and Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke earlier about our previously hidden and unacceptable past in political life as if it was only in the past few years that we became aware of the corruption which was rife where business interfaced with politics. I was elected to Dublin County Council in 1991 and found it to be an institution overrun with land speculators and their bagmen who carried on business with such gusto that it put the Dingle horse fair of my youth into the shade. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors &ndash; with the Progressive Democrats getting in on the act once or twice &ndash;  were driving a juggernaut through the county <Col N="31" /> council development process, rezoning in areas which were scandalously inappropriate. We now know in detail that a notorious figure who never left the public gallery during the debate on the development plan was the bagman for those seeking to enrich themselves at the cost of public representatives, doling out sums of money ranging from hundreds to thousands of pounds to councillors. Fianna Fáil public representatives, apart from Deputy Lawlor, were kept men by millionaire developers. That happened in the 1980s and 1990s. The system was degenerate and corrupt and property planning was brutally shunted to the side. The Taoiseach and many leading people in Fine Gael knew it was happening yet, in spite many of our protestations, no one lifted a hand to stop it.</P>
    <P>It is completely unconvincing for the Taoiseach to stand here today and pretend he is shocked by recent revelations. I represent Dublin West. It is the working class communities of Dublin West that have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of many of the decisions made in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, decisions made by public representatives who crowded into the chamber of Dublin County Council having rushed from Conway's pub, their pockets bulging with envelopes stuffed with cash from developers' bagmen on whose behalf they were voting. They did not vote for the interests of the working class people of Dublin West and other areas.</P>
    <P>It is those events which have led to the debate in this Chamber in spite of the studious attempts of the Taoiseach and others to prevent them being discussed here today. Let the people who have suffered have their say. The motion before the House should not merely call on Deputy Lawlor to resign, the Government should have announced an immediate by-election in Dublin West so that the long suffering residents of that constituency can have their democratic say and give their judgment on the abuse which has been heaped upon them for decades by politicians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation to the President of the High Court for affording me the opportunity to address this House this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly return to the beginning when I, like other Members of this House and local authorities, received correspondence from the chairman of the Flood tribunal requesting our co-operation and the provision of information. I did what most people would do; I passed the correspondence to my solicitor and he advised as to what should be done to comply. He raised some objections to the documentation and sought the advice of senior counsel, Mr. Adrian Hardiman. From Mr. Hardiman's interpretation of the documentation, he advised that there were certain anomalies. He went to the High Court and to the Supreme Court and was found to be correct on two counts. One year of interviews by the Flood tribunal's legal team without the chairman of the tribunal in attendance, and various other aspects <Col N="32" /> of the workings of the tribunal, were found to be illegal and had to be set aside. A full year's work was set aside. There has been no comment from the tribunal as yet about an apology or about the cost that was incurred during that period.</P>
    <P>I acted as any normal elected representative or &ldquo;Sean Citizen&rdquo; would do. I took advice to co-operate in whatever way I should. When I went to give evidence to the tribunal, my advice was that I was going there to deal with a number of specific headings. In the four days of evidence, it did not turn out quite that way, which was probably my fault. On day four, my credit cards were displayed on a screen while Mr. Gallagher, senior counsel, was questioning me about those cards. All the payments were catalogued. I did not see the purpose of that and I refused to answer. That was a momentous mistake on my behalf because it was interpreted as non-co-operation and the chairman of the tribunal, due to his frustrations, referred the matter to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I am not acting alone although I am responsible for my actions. When I went to the High Court, I took advice, I co-operated and I did what I was told I should do. In a lighter comment, I have been saying to friends that I thought &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; was a television channel, but I have since learned that it is a wider, more complicated and difficult matter with which to comply. Mr. Justice Smith found last week that I had still not complied with his order.</P>
    <P>I have not done this intentionally. Do I want to be standing here or serving a third term? The answer is that I do not want to be standing here. However, one must face the facts as they are. I had never been to the High Court in my life and did not understand the process there. When I went to the court for the first time, my previous adviser had been elevated to the High Court and Mr. John Rogers, senior counsel, took over to give me advice as to how to comply. The advice I got was that Mr. Justice Smith and the tribunal had explained what discovery was pre-Christmas 2000. With a small staff, I set about trying to identify anybody I ever had dealings with for the previous 30 years. My solicitor wrote 272 letters, with the chairman's orders attached, explaining that I had to co-operate with this tribunal and asking the recipients of the letters to assist in providing third party discovery so that I could do so. That embraced banks, building societies, friends, business colleagues and many others. The correspondence had a substantial response and I made discovery of that to the tribunal in further correspondence. I will come back to that.</P>
    <P>In doing so, I endeavoured to co-operate fully and was due to go back to Mr. Justice Smith after Christmas 2000. I hired a big photocopying machine and spent about a day and a half at Christmas discovering every piece of available paper I could in the time available. In particular, Mr. Rogers, senior counsel, handed to the Flood tribunal a file that I coincidentally call &ldquo;B42&rdquo;. I believe a &ldquo;B42&rdquo; is a large aeroplane. That file had &ldquo;one to 50&rdquo; names in it, and a record of every <Col N="33" /> penny I could recall receiving from anybody, my salary, expenses and a record of every other income I could put together. Mr. Rogers handed the file to Mr. Justice Smith and made particular emphasis about its content, and gave it to Mr. Frank Clarke, senior counsel for the tribunal. I might be wrong but I believe the tribunal was aware of three names out of the 50 before I handed in that document.</P>
    <P>Was I co-operating? That will have to be judged by somebody else some day. I thought the priority for the tribunal should be to identify from where any funds a person received came, and not to identify the overdraft or bank in which a person tried to juggle their funds when they had bank difficulties. To give the source of the funds seemed the most potent thing I could do to co-operate with this tribunal.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Smith found that there were deficiencies in discovery, compliance and so forth &ndash; although I do not for a moment make reference to the honourable judge's judgments, as it is inappropriate to do so. I am back before Mr. Justice Smith on 9 April next to hopefully draw a line in the concrete, not the sand, of discovery for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I will digress for a moment to pick up Deputy Noonan's point. Am I the cause of the delay of the Flood tribunal in making its interim report on modules that have nothing to do with me? I do not think so. There is enough criticism in the House about this tribunal. Deputy Noonan should look behind him where many colleagues of his have been trenchant in their criticism of this tribunal and its actions, as have many Members on this side of the House. However, they have expressed that criticism privately and will take their position in the House today by following their party line. I understand and respect that but the truth is slightly different.</P>
    <P>Affidavits were submitted to the High Court. During August 2001, I renewed my correspondence to the &ldquo;one to 50&rdquo; list, asking those people to provide records they had regarding this matter. I got replies from some. Affidavits were sworn by the tribunal in July. Regarding one of the sets of documents I sought, I got a letter from a leading firm of Dublin solicitors stating that, as well as my inquiry for third-party discovery, it had received a similar request from the tribunal. The firm intended to co-operate in providing the material and believed the tribunal would copy the same material to me. That is how the tribunal investigators operated. They went down like sliveens overnight and swore an affidavit to the High Court to convince Mr. Justice Smith that I was not co-operating, despite the fact that I was looking for the very same material to give to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>A number of affidavits have been sworn in the High Court that should be parked for another day and investigated for their veracity. My counsel in that court, in very diplomatic language, raised serious reservations about the solicitor who swore the affidavits. Last week, Mr. Justice Smith <Col N="34" /> referred to Landesbank in his judgment. I was criticised by counsel for the tribunal for belatedly travelling to that bank. I had written, telephoned and faxed the bank throughout the year, and had made discovery of all sorts of documentation directly to the tribunal. I have a letter, received from the bank, in which I asked specifically if the bank would please give me a letter, for use in Dublin, confirming that I have every shred of paper associated with my one account. The tribunal swore in an affidavit that I had eight accounts and convinced the Supreme Court of that also. I had one account.</P>
    <P>What did the tribunal do about the Landesbank situation? I have all the documentation and a letter. The bank holds its records for ten years. I signed an authorisation in the witness box 13 or 14 months ago to give the tribunal <i>carte blanche</i> to go to that bank and make discovery of everything there because I have nothing to hide there. Will Members believe me when I tell the House that the tribunal sent a fax of my authorisation to the bank and never did a single tap since? There has not been a telephone call to my solicitor, nor a letter to say it had not got what it wanted and would like my assistance. Despite a letter from the bank, Mr. Frank Clarke, senior counsel, quoted from a sworn affidavit in the High Court last week to say he is dissatisfied and that further documentation must be made available. Mr. Clarke then proceeded to qualify that by saying he was making no criticism of that international bank. Either I will be proved wrong or the tribunal will be proved wrong. If I provided all the documentation &ndash; and I have been informed there is no more documentation &ndash; the affidavit is to be questioned.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned co-operation. I wrote to 272 people, and to one to 50. I discovered all documentation corresponding to the tribunal and went to the court. That documentation was then criticised as unacceptable because it was not provided by way of affidavit. What will I do for 9 April? I could take 272 files, and one to 50 files, and start the process again, put them into affidavit form and deliver it to Mr. Justice Smith for 9 April. The tribunal has had this information for nine months but now I will do it the other way. Does that mean I have not been co-operating for the past 12 or 13 months? A very small staff and I, on the advice of a legal team, have attempted, to co-operate, although our efforts have unfortunately been found to be inadequate. Others will have to await judgment on whether that is so.</P>
    <P>Having believed that I had found the tribunal operating illegally in its first phase and then getting into a controversy of my own making, this became like a heavyweight contest. We are both punching hard and some punches land while others do not. If my solicitor or counsel, in discussions with the tribunal, had had any modicum of co-operation and contact, 90% of what is in these affidavits could be answered.</P>
    <P>US banks were referred to. I have three sons, the eldest of whom went to study in the States, to <Col N="35" /> be followed by the other lads who were pursuing various studies and golf scholarships. It now appears that every credit card or overdrawn account of $500 or $1,000 is discoverable. One of my sons has been in the States for four or five years working with a well known bank that is in the headlines at the moment &ndash; I hope I am not blamed for that but there is every possibility. I recalled this weekend that when he was going to the States to study he had a credit card. I told him to hold on to it and if he was short of a few bob, he should ring and I would put £500 or whatever in to it. Now I find that is a discoverable account of mine because I put £500 into it. I realised that this weekend. Every account that they ever had in the United States is discoverable.</P>
    <P>When the tribunal comes to discuss the next module &ndash; and I suggest respectfully to the House that whenever that will be, it is not due to my delaying &ndash; it should bring in whomsoever has complaints or allegations to make and the elected members who made decisions. The tribunal, however, may see this as the wrong way to approach the matter. It called a witness, Mr. Frank Dunlop, and gave him the run around for three or four days. As a result there were newspaper headlines identifying people by innuendo. Now he is gone and we have not heard from him since. I look forward to the day when I go to the Flood tribunal to answer for every decision I made in Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>I never agree with Deputy Higgins but we are both from the one bailiwick. Many other elected members from the area besides me have seen villages grow into two satellite towns. There have been tremendous achievements and progress for the young communities living there. I look forward to the day when I can answer the terms of reference of this tribunal.</P>
    <P>The tribunal, in its investigative mode, is in a trawl phase. It must be provided with every detail but 90% of what is discovered will probably have no relevance to its workings. If it was to address the planning decisions we made and study them in great detail &ndash; contributions provided, etc. &ndash; and if it was dissatisfied with the findings, it could trawl then. Perhaps that is an over-simplistic layman's view of the legal workings of a tribunal.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Smith has come to certain conclusions about the evidence provided on affidavit and I fully accept and respect that. We have all come across brilliant people of great intellect and, although I had never been in a court before, I was incredibly impressed by his attention to detail and the effort that he put into his investigations. I may not have got the decisions I would have wished for but, he would go away for weekends to work and study documents, then come back in and query certain matters. I have no criticism and I respectfully accept his decisions and hope I have taken them with some sort of humility and understanding before I head back to try to resolve this problem. I have until 9 April to provide all of the various information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> There are four c's &ndash; compliance, criminality, corruption and correspondence. In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> newspaper and so forth, I have already been found to be corrupt, although I do not know how. I sincerely hope, from its point of view, that Mr. Justice Flood finds that I am because if I am not, there will be another day in court.</P>
    <P>This House is deciding today, understandably in the political cut and thrust, that my actions have brought it into disrepute. I apologise that it has happened but when a person thinks he is slightly more than half right, he must stand up for what he believes and address that matter with whatever tools are available. The House decided earlier that I should fully co-operate and that is repeated in the motion today. As we come to the end of a 15 month period, I would like to think that I have turned a year on its head co-operating but it has not been totally adequate. If some of these affidavits are reviewed at a future date, by either the President of the High Court or someone else, they will prove what I have put before the House today. If I felt I was swimming against the tide coming into Dublin Bay last Friday, so be it. The waters will calm and I might get a chance to swim forward. In doing so, I hope that when people come to judge this phase that I will account for every penny I got and no one in the witness box will be able to make the slightest suggestion of corruption against Liam Lawlor. That was what the tribunal was set up to achieve and this House should let it do the job it was set up to do. If we criticise it, it should be for good reasons.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else, I have rights and I feel deeply wounded by what has happened, as have my family and friends. I did not wish to be in this position but I believe, <i>vis-à-vis</i> early misunderstanding or endeavouring to comply and not complying fully, that the courts have rightfully found non-compliance, but non-compliance in an unintentional and non-malicious way. This tribunal has the power to discover so why would I ever try to hide anything from it? It does not have the power abroad, however, and I know in my heart that it supposed initially when the Czech Republic came up for discussion that this was not firm, reasonable, intelligent, negotiated business, that it was some sort of a mystery. Perhaps its aggression is because it has not found what it thought it would.</P>
    <P>Let us continue with the tribunal and let us come to a conclusion in due course.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2001: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P Just="Center">Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;<Col N="37" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>For a few moments I had hoped there would be a rather unexpected interest in the comments I am about to make on the subject of housing. I am afraid, however, that like the unfortunate people who suffer from disabilities &ndash; some of whom are outside the gates of Leinster House today &ndash; the attention is directed elsewhere. It is not being focused on the very real and immediate problems that many people face, whether they suffer from disability or a lack of housing.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the contribution made by the Minister when introducing the Bill, focusing on one sentence in particular, which I find quite remarkable. The Minister stated, &ldquo;This Bill addresses a wide range of issues but the urgency of some of its provisions means that it is not as comprehensive as I would have liked.&rdquo; If the provisions of the Bill are urgent, as they are, why has it taken the Minister almost five years to introduce them? After five years in office, why is the Minister not in a position to introduce legislative measures which are, in his own words, as comprehensive as he would have liked? I have never seen a Government which after five years in office makes such a total and comprehensive admission of failure as is contained in that sentence.</P>
      <P>This is the first specific housing legislation that has been introduced by this Government in its five years in office to deal with what is one of the worst social problems. The Bill is titled as miscellaneous. It contains a number of tidying-up provisions in relation to the shared ownership scheme, affordable housing and the reporting of information by building societies. It contains a rather strange provision in relation to the purchase of dwellings by local authorities to which I will refer on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probable that the reason the Minister described it as urgent is the provision to increase the borrowing limit of the Housing Finance Agency from £1.5 billion to &euro;6 billion. I support the Government's measure to increase the borrowing limit of the Housing Finance Agency and the use of such moneys to solve the housing problem. When I read the Bill first I confess I was a little surprised that the borrowing limit was being extended from £1.5 billion to &euro;6 billion. Even the very radical measures which are advocated by the Labour Party, as distinct from the Government, to deal with the housing crisis would hardly reach &euro;6 billion. My surprise was answered when I saw paragraph (<i>c</i>) of section 17 which makes clear that this increased borrowing limit is being introduced to provide moneys to local authorities &ldquo;to be used by them for any capital purpose authorised by or under any enactment mentioned in the Schedule to this Act&rdquo;. Not surprisingly, the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, the Waste Management Acts and the Water Supplies Acts, are listed in the Schedule. Under the camouflage of what it calls a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Government is bringing a <Col N="38" /> provision before the Dáil to increase State borrowing. The reason the Minister described the Bill as urgent in his introductory speech is that the Government is pretending one thing to the public and doing something else in reality when it comes to borrowing.</P>
    <P>The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, came into this House on budget day and like a conjurer held up a budget and said he had balanced the books and given us a budget and a Book of Estimates with no Government borrowing. Yesterday we had a Bill in relation to energy which provides for an additional &euro;1 billion in borrowing; today we have the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill which provides for about &euro;4 billion in additional borrowing. This Bill is not about housing at all; it is about providing a vehicle whereby the Government can borrow money to carry out the infrastructural programme that is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party agrees that we should borrow to carry out infrastructural projects and to implement the national development plan. In the next couple of months when we argue that point in the context of an election, people on the Government side of the House and their spin people will be the first up to the microphone to say the Labour Party is proposing borrowing. It is true that we propose borrowing for capital purposes but I wish to bring to the attention of the House that the Government in this Bill is borrowing, despite the fact that the Minister for Finance denied he was borrowing. The Government is continuing to pretend to the people that it is not borrowing funds.</P>
    <P>It is a Bill which in reality has little to do with the housing crisis because its provisions will do nothing to address the immediate and real needs of people who cannot afford to buy a house or pay the exorbitant rents being charged in the private rented sector and who cannot feel secure in the flat or apartment they have rented because of the Minister's lack of legislation to provide protection for tenants, or people who are on council housing waiting lists. This Bill is giving a legislative basis to the shared ownership scheme, which is already in operation, and is providing a vehicle by which the affordable housing scheme can operate, which is already in operation albeit not very successfully. It gives local authorities the right to draw up some kind of priority system for the affordable housing scheme for which the Department of the Environment and Local Government has already issued guidelines and many local authorities have already gone ahead and implemented the scheme. In reality this Bill offers nothing new to deal with the housing crisis.</P>
    <P>The Government describes itself as the longest serving Government in the history of the State. Through that time it has, by and large, enjoyed a good press, paid for by the taxpayers who must not only fund the normal public relations staff of Departments and Ministers but the various public relations agencies and consultants who are attached to Ministers and whose job is to spin the <Col N="39" /> good news to the press in advance of announcements. This also covers some instances of public relations agencies who work for State agencies but who, in their off hours, appear to work as the private PR consultants of Ministers.</P>
    <P>History will be very unkind to this Government. Every Government is remembered for some achievement or failure but this one will be remembered as the Government which put owning a home beyond the reach of the ordinary family. That historic achievement, if it can be termed such, has changed not only the nature of housing tenure in the State but it has changed Irish society fundamentally for at least a generation in the same way as British society was changed in the 1980s following the economic changes wrought by Mrs. Thatcher.</P>
    <P>Until the Government took up office, home ownership had been the normal form of housing tenure and most young couples realistically aspired to owning their own home. In many cases council tenants graduated from renting to buying. Ireland had one of the highest levels of home ownership in Europe, at approximately 80%, and home ownership was the rock on which society was built. It was the aspiration to which the Government nominally subscribed on taking office when, in its Programme for Government, it declared as its objective the protection and promotion of the concept of home ownership.</P>
    <P>However, when the Government took up office the average price of a house was &euro;87,202, whereas, according to the latest figure, for September 2001, it is &euro;169,191. Since the Government took up office, the average price of a new house has increased by 137 points on the house price index scale. In the same period, the consumer price index rose by only 20 points, from 113 at the end of 1996 to 133 in the third quarter of 2001; average earnings rose by only 35 points, from 121 in 1996 to 156 for the latest date for which figures are available and the cost of building index rose by only 49 points, from 116 at the end of 1996 to 165 in the third quarter of 2001. Under this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, house prices have risen by almost seven times the rate of inflation, by four times the rate of pay increases and, lest anyone think that the rise in house prices is due to the wages paid to bricklayers and building workers, by three times the rate of increase in the cost of building.</P>
    <P>In practical terms this means that families on moderate incomes, who could afford to buy their own home when the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, took over responsibility for housing, can no longer afford to do so from their own resources. Such families include teachers, nurses, gardaí, factory supervisors and postal workers with some overtime. They are the people who are building the economy the Government is so fond of praising and their taxes are contributing to the increased revenues the Government has had available to it <Col N="40" /> to deal with problems such as housing and other public services.</P>
    <P>Some of these people eventually manage to buy a home of their own and they do so in three ways. First, they get financial help from their parents. A financial institution recently estimated that, typically, parents are now putting up &euro;50,000 for a child buying his or her first home. This money comes from pension lump sums or savings. A price will eventually have to be paid for it because, understandably and generously, it is money which parents provide to enable their children get a toe on the house purchase ladder. It would otherwise have been used at a later stage in those people's lives for nursing home care and retirement. At some stage somebody else will pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>The second way in which young people are managing to get their toe on the house purchase ladder is to saddle themselves with crippling mortgages. Responding to the demand from new borrowers and to increased house prices, lending institutions have changed their lending policies in the lifetime of the Government. It is ironic that when houses were affordable the lending institutions were much more restrictive about what they were prepared to lend. When I bought a house 20 years ago the maximum loan available was 2.5 times the principal income plus what was called the subsidiary income. Now, when houses are expensive, the lending agencies have a new maximum of three times the combined income. Almost every young family which took out a mortgage in the lifetime of this Government has locked itself into a 25 year financial commitment which, in many cases, they will not be able to afford if things go wrong, for example, if either of the partners gets sick, loses a job or some unforeseen financial obligations arise.</P>
    <P>In view of the high mortgages, both partners in a relationship must work. High house prices have abolished the right of families to choose that one parent will remain at home with children, even for a limited period, typically when the children are small. The Government has abolished that option.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has always supported the right of everybody to work but the Government has gone a step further in making work for parents compulsory to pay the mortgage. If there was any doubt about the Government's intention, the taxation policies pursued by the Minister for Finance, when he introduced a tax regime penalising stay at home parents, have underlined its approach. All of this has created a new crisis in child care. Parents who must work to pay a mortgage must find somebody to mind their children. There is so much demand and such limited supply that they incur an enormously increased cost. In many cases &ndash; the third consequence of high house prices &ndash; the only house a couple can buy is some distance from their place of work or family networks.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there is a new commuter belt. It extends to Gorey &ndash; the property pages of today's <Col N="41" /> newspapers advertise new houses in Gorey with a map of the east coast showing how close it is to Dublin &ndash; Athy, Mullingar &ndash; the new suburban estates which can be seen when driving through Rochfortbridge &ndash; and Ardee and is contributing to the increased traffic and transport clog with which we are all familiar. It is also increasing wear and tear on the individuals who have to drive to and from work to these new far flung traffic congested suburbs. It is putting a strain on children who do not see their parents from very early in the morning until very late in the evening and on normal human and personal relationships. This is to be found, not only in Dublin, but in other cities also.</P>
    <P>We hear much from planners and those who have an interest in planning about the 40% of dwellings built last year which were one-off housing. That one-off housing is built, not because of any intention on the part of those concerned to do something that is regarded as bad planning, but because it is the only way a couple who buy a site, three or four miles from a village or town, will be able to afford a home of their own.</P>
    <P>It is some achievement for the Government that those whom we describe as the lucky ones, those who have been lucky enough to buy their own homes, have to get up at 6 a.m., leave their children to a minder at 7 a.m. spend three hours a day in traffic getting to and from work, return home at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. jaded and have little time to spend with their children or enjoy a normal relationship. They have no escape because of the cost of their mortgage. This is mortgage slavery. The Government, through its housing policies, has turned a generation into mortgage slaves. Those who have not been lucky enough to be mortgage slaves have no choice but to rent.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the rental situation. Those who could buy their homes before the Government took office are now joining the queue for rental accommodation &ndash; students, temporary workers, single people and, in some cases, those waiting for local authority housing. Much attention has been paid to the lack of supply of private rented accommodation in respect of which I agree there is a problem. The reason such accommodation has become so expensive is that the demand side has also increased. The increase has been brought about by those who, before the Government took office, would have been able to buy a home of their own. The apartment or house which one could have rented for &euro;500 per month, before mid-1997, now costs about &euro;1,200.</P>
    <P>On top of this the Government has failed to introduce any legislation to give protection to tenants. When the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, took office he could not see the problem. He ended up being embarrassed into establishing a commission on the private rented sector which reported to him in July 2000. He made a public statement that he would do something about the matter in September 2000 and announced in January 2001 that he would bring forward legislation <Col N="42" /> to provide protection for private tenants which we have not yet seen.</P>
    <P>In its report the commission on the private rented sector estimated that there were 135,000 private rented tenancies, an estimate it based on the figures available for 1997. Given what has happened to the housing market since 1997, there are 200,000 private rented tenancies in which about 400,000 people live. Unlike other countries, they live in an insecure regime where they can be evicted at a month's notice, where rents can be increased as often as a landlord wishes and, in some cases, they are evicted.</P>
    <P>Eviction has always been an emotive issue. Evictions are a daily occurrence in this prosperous country of ours. Old private rented accommodation is being upgraded or sold. In some cases landlords believe they can get a higher rent from the next batch of tenants. Thousands of families have been evicted legally under the Government while a large number of illegal evictions have been well documented by Threshold in particular. It is some achievement for the Government that more Irish families have lost their homes through eviction in the five years it has been in office than in any corresponding period of the land war in the 19th century under the British.</P>
    <P>These evictions have created the new homeless, typically a single parent with one or two children, who are accommodated temporarily in bed and breakfast accommodation. In some cases they are in such accommodation for 18 months or two years. Under this regime they have to be out in the morning by 10 a.m. They take their children to school and find something to do during the day. Sometimes they have a younger child whom they push in a buggy. They collect the children from school and find a place to occupy their time, such as a public park, go in and out of shops, perhaps visit a friend, until it is time to go return to the bed and breakfast accommodation at 6 p.m.</P>
    <P>All of us who are parents know that there are holidays for two or three weeks and people have to live a mobile life where they manage children in buggies. Young mothers visit my advice centres with children in buggies who, understandably, are restless. I really do not know how they manage. They push a child from Billy to Jack for the entire day with little or no prospect of housing being provided for them. This is the new Ireland that the Government has created through its housing policies. I admire the fortitude of the parents of those children, but what are the social, educational and health consequences down the line for both parents and children who have to live in such conditions? The Government's housing policy has been a disgrace, testified to by the fact there were 26,000 applicants on local authority lists when it took office, yet when I asked the Minister with responsibility for housing for the current figure last week, he could not provide an answer. Either he does not know how many applicants are on the waiting lists or he will not tell us &ndash; I do not know which is worse. I estimate there are about 60,000 families on local authority <Col N="43" /> waiting lists. The Taoiseach has admitted that the official programme of building 25,000 local authority dwellings under the PPF will not be met. It is time the Minister of State, the Minister and the Government were swept from office and a Government elected which will deal with the housing crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of vilification of the record of the Government on housing, some of which we have just heard from Deputy Gilmore. I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, for the way in which they have pushed out the boundaries on housing. I accept that not everything is perfect and much remains to be done. However, the Bill tries to address some of this. For example, it creates certainty about a number of schemes which was lacking heretofore.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position to address a couple of my concerns about several schemes on Committee Stage. I welcome the opportunity to comment on the two schemes which are making a huge difference to home ownership. The shared ownership scheme, commonly known in Dublin as the 50/50 scheme, has been extraordinarily successful. The numbers availing of it are growing by the year and it is probably the most popular scheme in the Dublin City Council area. It gives people who would not otherwise own a house a sense of expectation of owning one. The scheme is open to individuals with an income of less than £25,000 and couples with an income of less than £62,500. Very large numbers of my constituents are availing of it.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government on the introduction of the excellent affordable housing scheme. The site subsidy of around £30,000 made available by the local authority also assists many people to acquire their first home. I also have concerns about the scheme, one of which, the delay in progressing projects, I have previously raised in the House. Dublin City Council varied the 1991 development plan in 1998 to allow the construction of an affordable housing scheme of 106 houses in my constituency. Apart from the erection of boundary fencing at the site before Christmas, nothing else has happened and the site works have yet to be carried out. This raises a concern about the capacity of local authorities to deliver on schemes of this nature, and I ask the Minister to address this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not always agree with proposals emanating from the Labour Party, in this case I <Col N="44" /> agree that serious consideration must be given to the proposal to set up a national housing agency to build houses. A system of faster delivery is needed. The backlog of cases on the housing lists would not be half as bad if we had a better delivery mechanism. Other problems associated with the shared ownership scheme are outside the Minister's remit. For instance, the extraordinarily long time it takes to process them through the legal system in terms of solicitors, conveyancing and land registration puts some people off participating.</P>
    <P>It is possible that my concern about the issue of clawback as it relates to the sale of affordable and shared ownership houses is misplaced. The vast majority of shared ownership houses with which I have dealt are secondhand. In many cases people who buy into the scheme transfer to a standard building society or bank mortgage after three or four years because the interest rate is lower and they can buy out the local authority's equity and receive tax relief on the mortgage without penalty. Will the Minister clarify whether such transfers from the standard shared ownership to a bank or building society loan could be regarded as a sale and, therefore, subject to the clawback to which the early sections of the Bill refer? If that is the case, I ask the Minister to revisit the provisions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal on the selection of applicants for affordable housing. In Dublin City Council we have come up with a selection process which we believe to be about right. Under this template, 35% of applicants are selected on the basis that they live near the site, a further 35% are drawn from the general constituency and the remainder is selected from other areas in the Dublin region. Given the importance it attaches to the interests of community stability, this method should be treated as the template.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the multi-annual approach, by which the allocation for local authority housing will be made every four years, is an excellent measure which most local authorities welcome. In Dublin, we are meeting and even exceeding our targets. However, because of land shortage in the city area, the only way to do so is to buy back houses. This raises a problem which, I suspect, may be unique to Dublin. Once the houses have been bought back, they are handed over to a private builder for refurbishment. Six months later, however, they are still unoccupied and boarded up, which means we cannot get them delivered fast enough. In my ward, Finglas, there are 23 or 27 houses &ndash; I stand open to correction on the figure &ndash; in this condition. Boarded up houses attract anti-social behaviour and their quality deteriorates. It bothers me greatly that perfectly good houses, which are well furnished and decorated and have aluminium windows and good kitchens, have to be torn apart to conform to building regulations and the directives of the Department. That matter needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill needs to address another housing issue affecting the Dublin region. Estate management <Col N="45" /> and the responsibility of the local authority for matters such as common areas are covered. Under current legislation local authorities are able to take action in response to incidents of anti-social behaviour by tenants, but are powerless to do anything about tenant purchasers. While I agree that one should not be able to introduce measures retrospectively, is it not possible to ensure that future tenant purchasers are subject to the same local authority supervision and control as applies to tenants? </P>
    <P>On the issue of common ownership, years ago in Dublin there was a practice of building maisonettes. Members are probably aware of a test case in Cork in which a long-term tenant is attempting to buy the maisonette in which he lives, but is being hampered by the inability of the local authority to find a way around the problems arising from the sale of a single maisonette in a block of tenancy dwellings. For example, how would it address the legalities of burst pipes or water leaking from a tenancy dwelling into a private dwelling? Will the Minister address this matter? </P>
    <P>The Minister raised the matter of Traveller accommodation. A large number of Travellers live in and around my constituency, 99% of whom do not cause problems and are quite well settled. Many of them have asked me if Travellers can have the same type of letting agreement open to other people in local authority accommodation. I understand this is not the case. It causes problems as far as security of tenure is concerned. It also causes problems for the local authority in terms of acting against anti-social tenants. There were a number of court cases involving local authorities prior to Christmas but they are dead in the water unless some kind of provision is made in that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill. I would like the Minister to address the points I have made. I know they are very specific but they would add a further degree of certainty to the schemes, which are working well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rural Deputy, I am glad to speak on the Bill after the contributions of so many Dublin Deputies. We may have the same difficulties of housing people in Donegal but the way we deal with them is slightly different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be commended on the unprecedented rise in the number of houses being provided, although there is more to be done. Since I last examined the statistics we have approximately &euro;1.07 million in the budget for housing compared to £507,000 during the reign of the rainbow coalition, a three-fold increase. The facts speak for themselves. People are making an effort and the results can be seen, particularly in Donegal where there has been a 500% increase in the amount of money provided for housing. It can be seen on the ground also. When I first came into politics 16 years had passed since a house had been built in my home town, not unlike the situation around <Col N="46" /> the peninsula. Since then estates have been built in Carndonagh, Buncrana, Moville, Greencastle, Clonmany, Culdaff, Gleneely and Newtowncunningham, and that is only in my own immediate patch. Council estates have been built or expanded in other areas. The turnkey projects are well supported and they have speeded up the process of getting houses built and occupied.</P>
    <P>Water and sewerage infrastructure difficulties are not helping the situation but they are being addressed. Since this Government came into office, Muff sewerage scheme has been completed and with all the development a small village has developed into a large town. Carndonagh sewerage scheme is currently under construction, which is aiding investment in a town whose population had begun to decrease and which would then have suffered in terms of support for schools, shops, etc. I know that Malin town will be accommodated soon, possibly under an extension of the Carndonagh scheme, and Killea is being serviced under the serviced land initiative, another initiative of this Government. We will soon be pressing the Minister for money for the Moville and Greencastle sewerage scheme, which we had hoped to have in operation ten years ago but which for one reason or another did not happen. These projects are important given that these areas come under the town renewal scheme. I trust the Minister will also look favourably on the needs of the Buncrana phase 5 proposal, commonly known as the Aghilly scheme.</P>
    <P>Initiatives have begun in the smaller towns also that need a serious level of support in the form of group sewerage schemes. I am thinking in particular of Ture and Ballyliffen. I am aware that the issue of pilot areas is being examined, but I ask the Minister of State to talk to his senior Minister about the concept of the group sewerage scheme grant which must be raised to that of the group water scheme. I am aware there have been discussions on the issue but with the proliferation of septic tanks and individuals coming together in groups, the group sewerage scheme would serve a useful purpose. It is important, therefore, that people at local level get the support they deserve but current funding does not deal with that reality. I ask the Minister of State to examine that issue again in terms of an immediate progression.</P>
    <P>Water supply is also a major aspect in terms of housing provision. Turnkey projects and individual homes in my home town could not be progressed over the past two years due to a lack of water. That there can be a lack of such basic infrastructure in 2002 is daunting, but the problem is being addressed by the Government. When I first came into this House the areas around west Innishowen and the Lagan desert were without water but with an allocation of £32.5 million we have water in most pipes with serious progress being made on the remaining group schemes.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the announcement on the rural water programme and to the delivery of more funding, particularly for east Inishowen, to overcome the problem of aged infrastructure and <Col N="47" /> the difficulties created by the traditional loughs coming under pressure through new levels of building.</P>
    <P>Huge developments, particularly in the Border region, are creating new towns on the sites of old established villages and I trust the Minister will help county councils in their quest to address the social and infrastructural issues created by such sudden growth. While this may be old news to the people of Dublin, it is a new world with which we have to come to terms.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the issue of the new house grant. I am aware that everybody is complaining that if we raise the £3,000 to £10,000 it will go straight into the cost of building and to the developer, and not to where the money is needed, but with a bit of imagination and initiative it could be tied into mortgage relief or something that could be claimed back over a number of years. If it was increased it might encourage some people to make the effort to build within the terms of the grant because currently the grant is not an incentive to encourage people to build.</P>
    <P>The changes in the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant are very important and I compliment the Minister on them. Housing aid for the elderly is the best scheme in relation to housing at present, although perhaps the ceiling should be raised. It is currently approximately £2,000 but it could be raised to about £4,000. Perhaps it is decided on a health board by health board basis. There can never be enough investment in the scheme because councils would be under more pressure to re-house people.</P>
    <P>The housing aid for the elderly scheme should be expanded to accommodate widows. Widows who have experienced a sudden bereavement might not anticipate that work needs to be done on a house. They find themselves in a situation where their income has decreased but the house might need a new roof or new windows. Widows are a special case and their situation should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I look forward to improvements in relation to specific instance houses which are well supported in Donegal, but co-ordination needs to improve. I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the grant aid he allocated to Donegal County Council for a number of one stop shops. There are so many sections in the council, whether it be in Lifford, Buncrana or Carndonagh, that the SI process can takes years. That should not be the case and I hope the one stop shop initiative will deal with that.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the advancement of opportunities for devising a policy on couples without children, particularly single people and those who cannot get onto the council's priority list. The Bill will begin to address those types of issues, but I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in voluntary housing, whose contribution to society has been enormous. They have been able to address issues that councils have been unable to prioritise. That process was <Col N="48" /> very well supported in terms of the initiatives from the Government and I would like to see this support continue. I am aware they have been doing excellent work in Donegal.</P>
    <P>The multi-annual approach, which we talk about in almost every sector including health, housing, etc., has been excellent. County councils and urban councils should know a number of years in advance what their budgets will be because it gives them an incentive to draw down as quickly as possible the current year allocation with a view to progressing many of the schemes. Our own council is responding well to the moneys allocated to it.</P>
    <P>Many of the answers to the housing problem lie in council housing schemes but a small minority of people living in council houses are either engaged in anti-social behaviour or do not look after the premises to the standard of the majority of the people in the estate, which can cause friction. The question of councils having sufficient manpower to inspect their estates, with the necessary back-up, should be examined. Support from health boards and a cross-departmental approach are often needed as the problem may not be solved by the council alone. Given the fact that manpower in the councils is at full stretch, other professionals may be needed. Policies in this area need to be examined with a view to tightening them up. I know that people sign tenancy agreements, but I am worried about what follows.</P>
    <P>As the national spatial strategy is about to be concluded, I would hate to miss the opportunity to stress once more to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, that County Donegal needs to be carefully considered. Deputy Gilmore complained about the fact that houses for commuters are being built in towns like Ardee, but access to Donegal is just as important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Tom Hayes.</P>
      <P>I was slightly surprised to hear that the number of completed units in 2001 had increased to about 50,000, as I thought the figure would be below that for 2000. Having said that, the figure would be even greater if the Government had not taken certain measures in recent years. House completions had been increasing at a good rate in the mid-1990s and the industry was gearing up for further developments. Following the Bacon report, however, the Government took steps which led to a decrease in housing supply, as they discouraged developers and builders. I do not wish to speak on behalf of developers, as they are well capable of putting their views across, but the Government must understand the importance of working with those involved in the industry. Those who try to understand developers sometimes have slurs cast upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to be constructive and not overly critical, but our housing system, which involves the Department of the Environment and Local Government working with local authorities, does not work. A national housing agency, similar to <Col N="49" /> that in Northern Ireland, is required. The implementation of policies put in place by the Department cannot be supervised if it has to work with up to 80 local authorities. There are far too many housing authorities and it would be better if we at least restricted the number to one per county. This crazy situation is evident in the Bill which recognises the housing agencies in various towns. I am sure those involved with housing authorities would be disturbed to hear a politician say that their powers should be taken away, but I believe this duplication needs to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney quite rightly mentioned the housing aid for the elderly scheme, a worthwhile programme operated by the health boards. I would like to relate two instances of difficulty, however. I recently had to contact the South-Western Area Health Board about a document which had been sent to it last August by Wicklow County Council regarding a disability grant and discovered that there has been no examination of the application to date. I was told some weeks ago that about 645 applications for houses have been received by the South-Western Area Health Board. It is impossible for the health board to keep up with the applications it is receiving.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that many houses are in poor condition and that some are without electricity, water or bathrooms. Local authorities and health boards do not operate a proactive system to identify those in substandard accommodation and usually find out only when contacted by a local politician, concerned priest or solicitor. My arguments are based on the areas I know best, but I assume the experience is not too dissimilar elsewhere. Those who are given houses are generally quite deserving, but far more deserving people sometimes suffer as a result of having nobody to speak for them. A proactive national housing authority, which can act directly without having to deal with local authorities and health boards, is needed.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a few points in relation to the Bill. Previous speakers have referred to section 17, which does not seem to be in line with the rest of the Bill. It was discussed out of sequence in the Minister's speech and it is really a separate item, which does not belong in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill. It should have been given a Bill of its own or introduced in a different context. Perhaps I am misreading the section, but I am concerned that the cost of the provision of additional sewerage and other facilities will be passed on to developers or builders. If this is the case, areas which are deficient in such services at the moment will remain inferior. What businessman in his right mind will develop houses in an area where large levies have to paid as a contribution to a sewerage system or water facility, especially when developed sites are available? I read in a newspaper that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is the second longest serving Member of the House, so I am sure he will consider this matter if he has not done so already. The Government <Col N="50" /> needs to ensure that there is a balance between those that have benefited in the past and those that have been neglected. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the matter when he concludes this Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 8, it is important that we do the right thing as regards affordable housing, as it is a matter that will cause great controversy in local areas. The Ombudsman's report some years ago stated that local authorities should impose a points system. While I understand that it is impossible to have a perfect system, a transparent system needs to be put in place so that people can understand how decisions are made. There will always be people who are disappointed when housing lists are compiled, but it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the reasons why certain decisions are taken. The Minister of State may argue that he has given guidelines to local authorities and that it is now a matter for them, but that, in itself, may be an example of how the system does not work.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 deal with the situation that arises when houses people have bought from the State are sold a few months later. It is very important that regulations in this area are put on a statutory footing, so that nobody can be seen to benefit to an extreme extent from the State's decision to facilitate their housing needs. We should not allow such people to make a killing.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with housing grants, which were introduced in the 1970s or 1980s to assist the building industry. If I was the Minister responsible for housing, I would abolish the housing grant. It is clear that the grant, which is for first time buyers, goes straight to builders. Only about one third of first time buyers are assisted in this way, however, as about two thirds of them buy second-hand houses. Deputy Keaveney said that we should consider increasing mortgage interest relief, which is probably the best way to assist first time buyers. As I believe that we need to be prudent, such an increase may be offset by decreasing the length of time of the relief from 20 years to 10 years, by limiting the relief and by making most payments in the first five years. These provisions would mean that the benefits of the grant would be felt right across the board by first time buyers, regardless of whether the house being bought is new or second-hand. I am not in favour of the grant as it is currently distributed. While I condemn the first time buyers grant generally, I welcome the fact that it is to be extended to separated persons. It is good that we recognise the difficulties faced by separated people.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with data, information and research, areas in which we are very weak. I am sure the Department would admit that we have not had enough research, so it is good that these areas are to be strengthened. The Minister mentioned some of the amendments he intends to make on Committee Stage. It is surprising after all these years that Bills still undergo major changes on Committee Stage. I hope that certain elements of Deputy Olivia Mitchell's Bill in <Col N="51" /> relation to temporary Traveller encampments can be taken on board, as it is important that we deal with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pat Carey pointed out that 99% of Travellers are fine and integrate well. It is not necessary that they integrate <i>per se</i>, but they are well behaved. However, a small number of Travellers manipulate the system. Members are familiar with this practice in our constituencies and this should be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brian Hayes introduced an anti-gazumping Bill and I think it was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who expressed constitutional doubts about the legislation. In the debate I referred to a judgment by, I think, Mr. Justice Kenny who referred to an Article in the Constitution which dealt with the exigencies of the common good superseding individual rights. In a court case contesting the 20% social housing provision the Government defended the scheme on the basis of the exigencies of the common good while it had earlier used that principle to defeat the anti-gazumping Bill. I hope measures are introduced to deal with gazumping. It is crazy that we have so many housing authorities.</P>
      <P>The rent subsidy scheme operated by health boards, to put it mildly, is being ripped off around the country. One bedroom flats in small towns are being let for £200 or £300 per week and the rent is paid for by the health board. It is often the case that these premises are not inspected and are of an inferior quality. I accept that this issue comes down to manpower and this goes back to my main point that the present system is unsatisfactory to deal with the housing issue. In conjunction with the Minister for Health and Children, will the Minister of State ensure that, at the very least, premises are inspected? Young couples, individuals and single mothers are living in atrocious conditions and the State is subsidising 90% to 95% of their rent. I do not deny these people the subsidy, but it is terrible that they are being subsidised to live in such conditions.</P>
      <P>There is a great push on the part of local authorities to build housing units, but we must take account of quality and the social environment. The professions, particularly architects, argue for high density developments with 25 or 30 units per acre. We have to tread carefully and put money aside for playgrounds and parks. The day is gone when one could let kids wander up the fields. Children must have facilities nearby where they can be supervised by parents or whoever. It is important that we put such facilities in place. Many areas do not have such facilities and this has given rise to much social deprivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> I refer to the manner in which the strategic planning guidelines are being interpreted by some councils. The Department is re-examining this issue, but one of the problems is that the guidelines issued for Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Dublin are being interpreted differently by different authorities. This is not good enough. If a guideline is issued local authorities should know what they are supposed to be implementing. Wicklow County Council is interpreting the guidelines incorrectly and the Department should produce a definitive definition or bring in the county managers. I accept that this is a function of the members, but they received incorrect advice. I would not support that advice.</P>
    <P>Under the tenant purchase scheme, a tenant buying a house in which he or she has lived for ten years or more gets 30% off the price. I presume this is the same throughout the country. We have to build in a claw-back system. I am sure the Minister of State has heard my earlier points, but I would ask him to take account of the many people who have lived in the same house for 20 or more years who only receive the 30% provision.</P>
    <P>I am aware of someone who began renting a house in the late 1960s which cost £3,000 to build. There has been a dramatic rise in the cost of houses recently. People in their sixties whose children may have a steady job for the first time and who wish to buy their house which is now valued at £80,000 or £90,000 only get one third off that price. A neighbour may have bought a similar house five or six years ago for £15,000, but they now have to pay £50,000 which they cannot afford. Will the Minister of State examine the possibility of a scheme whereby those who have lived in a house for 20 or more years would get two thirds off the price if they wished to buy it? Such a scheme would have to include a strong claw-back arrangement to ensure that the house is not sold the following day. Many families are caught in a trap and cannot buy their houses due to the increase in value. When replying to the debate will the Minister of State give some indication of whether he will examine this issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Timmins for sharing time and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Housing is a major issue. Deputies who are members of local authorities deal on a weekly basis with the housing needs of constituents, whether young or old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members can identify with the issues raised in this debate. One of the important issues is the slow pace at which developments proceed. We must urgently address the delay from the time the Department allocates money to a local authority to the day when people can take up residence. This delay adds to people's hardship and frustration and this is the case with small and large schemes. If the Minister of State takes one message from this debate I hope it is the frustration caused by the delay from planning stage to the moment when residents move in. I would <Col N="53" /> be interested to know the average length of time involved in such developments.</P>
    <P>We need more housing due to the fact that this is a rapidly developing country with many young people. There has also been a change in society in that there are now more single parent families. At a recent council meeting in my area it was pointed out that 400 to 500 people are being investigated for or are on the housing waiting list. However, the council is only building about 60 houses which is significantly less than the number required. This issue goes back to my point about the speed at which we are building such houses.</P>
    <P>One of the main elements of the Bill concerns the shared ownership scheme. However, many people and local authority members find the scheme cumbersome and difficult. Deputy Gilmore referred to the number and cost of houses being built in Bray and the counties surrounding Dublin. I have spoken on many occasions in the House about the building of an increasing number of houses on the east coast, particularly in the counties surrounding Dublin. We must address this issue urgently. I am aware of beautiful three bedroom houses in towns in Tipperary which cannot be sold for £100,000. These houses would sell for much more in the east. When discussing the overall development of the country we must address the locations at which houses are being built.</P>
    <P>Several local authorities are drawing up plans for villages. There is no point in drawing up plans for houses unless sewerage schemes are put in place. All too often I have come across cases where villages have plans for sewerage schemes which will take years to establish. As well as housing developments and schemes, back-up facilities such as water and sewerage are required. Developers, councils or voluntary bodies may then develop those schemes. There can be no developments without back-up facilities.</P>
    <P>A key area which is not under the jurisdiction of the Minister but that of the Department of Health and Children is the housing aid for the elderly scheme. That should be administered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It could have an immense impact on many old people. I have come across people who have no toilet facilities or proper doors and windows. To have these houses upgraded, so that they could be passed on to grandchildren, for example, would take some pressure off the housing market. I intend to address this issue on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic boom we have experienced in the past few years has brought a variety of benefits. However, there were also unpleasant consequences. This housing Bill is an attempt to rectify some of the consequences of the spiralling price of housing. The Bacon report has considered the issue. I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and <Col N="54" /> Local Government, Deputy Molloy, on the way he has handled this issue during the term of this Government. He has been proactive in terms of considering ways and means for young people, in particular, to have the opportunity to own their own homes. This Bill is another step in the right direction. At one stage the prices of houses in Dublin and Cork and all over the country were spiralling out of control. Potential first-time purchasers were not in a position to buy their own homes. For a while we had to drive the investor out of the market so that reality could be restored. Having done that, we can now be satisfied that common sense has been restored and house prices have dropped steeply.</P>
    <P>The provision of affordable housing is significant as it will bring about a proper social mix in our estates. Obviously there is resistance to that. People will want to know whether there is social housing provided or to be provided in their estates. They might prefer that there was not. However, as time goes on, we all have a responsibility to the communities to be up-front in promoting social housing and in persuading builders and landowners and everybody else involved to be sensitive to the needs of young couples who want to buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins mentioned rent subsidies. My understanding was that we were to transfer, some time ago, the responsibility for rent subsidies from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. This would be right and proper, because most people who receive rent subsidy are on the housing list. If that were the case, they would be subject to investigation by the housing inspector, their needs would be assessed and they would be visited in their current dwellings. Inspectors could examine the state of the property being rented and would be aware that the property was rented and should be registered. They would also ensure the standard of rented accommodation was in keeping with the social needs of tenants. Under the present scheme, whereby the community welfare officer from the health board is approached because of rent, he or she is usually not in a position to inspect the accommodation due to the size of his workload. I call on the Minister to accelerate the process.</P>
    <P>Some Members are also finding that many private property owners will not rent to people who are receiving a rent supplement. This may be because they have not registered due to the income tax difficulties involved. We now have a mechanism whereby we can overcome this difficulty once and for all and whereby everybody in the rented housing sector can be compliant. I compliment the Government on its budget provisions which encourage the investor back into the housing market. It did not make sense to be sending millions of pounds to Spain or to the UK. While the measures that were taken were needed at the time to restore reality, the Government reacted quickly and strongly to arrest immediately the spiralling increase in house prices. As a <Col N="55" /> result of its measures, the investor has now been restored to the market, which will mean that rents, due to the plentiful supply of rented accommodation, will not be as high as they have been. The take-up for housing, according to many house builders, has accelerated since the budget. It is to be hoped that we will soon have more and cheaper accommodation for everybody.</P>
    <P>The issue of housing density will also need to be addressed. While Bacon suggests that there should be higher density in housing and that we should consider European models, there can be problems with this. For example, there may be a green space zoned for development which is surrounded by houses at the traditional density of eight to the acre. It will be difficult for the immediate community to accept the building of apartments at a density of 14 to 16 to the acre. They will be concerned because of the lack of privacy. Instead, we should take a sensible approach. The possibility of a new development interfering with the privacy of existing houses, some of whose residents may have been there for many years, should be taken into consideration. In many of the older estates, as a result of the Celtic tiger and the massive increase in the number of cars on the road, car-parking facilities are inadequate. Some of the residents of older estates are in contact with Members on a regular basis, asking whether some green area can be removed to provide parking.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be faced with a problem. The Bacon report recommends increased density but the parking accommodation that is going to be part and parcel with that high density is not on a par with it. We appear to be reducing the car parking spaces while we are increasing density. Obviously there is a very good reason for that but it is posing problems where one does not have effective public services in tandem with it. I would have thought high density would ensure increasing numbers of people would leave their cars at home to use the public service but, unfortunately, we have not arrived at that situation yet.</P>
    <P>The housing aid for the elderly scheme is outstanding. I compliment the Minister on the fact that he saw the common sense in increasing the budget to this sector in each of the last five years. In doing that he has brought great comfort to many elderly people around the country, be it in the provision of a front door, a window or sanitary facilities. That scheme is most worthwhile and I exhort the Minister to ensure the budget for it continues to be increased on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>A problem is posed in regard to the disabled person's grant. In order to allocate a disabled person's grant an occupational therapist has to ensure that the person qualifies for it, but due to the lack of occupational therapists there is a major delay in having the merits of the case examined. That is not something we are going to overcome in the short term but we should look at <Col N="56" /> how we might speed up the process to prevent the delays that are currently being experienced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in that it brings forward a number of measures to improve the housing situation. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when dealing with the planning and development legislation in 1999 in this House said the following:</P>
      <P>The provision of adequate housing for all members of society has been a major issue of public policy for Governments of all shades since this State gained its independence. It has further been a traditional aim of Government to facilitate people in buying their own homes where this is possible. This has had a stabilising effect on Irish society and home ownership is an aspiration which the vast majority of people hold dear. This Government will continue to support that aspiration but the State also has as responsibility to assist those who cannot afford to house themselves in the market. This has been done through the provision of local authority or other social housing. Part V of this Bill is designed to underpin these two planks of our housing policy.</P>
      <P>That summarises the Government's policy in relation to housing and I wholeheartedly support it. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for getting that legislation on the Statute Book. He was opposed by powerful interests, including the building and construction industry. He was also opposed in this House by Fine Gael. He persisted with Part V of the Bill, which deals with the preparation by local authorities of housing strategies and brings forward the 20% social and affordable housing provision. The constitutionality of this section was tested in the Supreme Court and the Minister won the argument. I congratulate him&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because that 20% social and affordable housing provision is the cornerstone of how we are going to deal with the housing problem we have today. It is being implemented slowly but surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the housing situation in the greater Dublin area, I wish to refer to the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area for 1999 and also to the high density strategy put forward by the Department. This aims to avoid a sprawling city, to deal with traffic problems and so on. We need to implement these policies with caution, because they can pose a threat to some of our traditional neighbourhoods. We need to utilise the protected structures' provision of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, but more particularly we need to utilise to a much greater extent the architectural conservation areas' provision in the Planning and Development Act, 2000 in order to save our trad<Col N="57" /> itional communities from high density developments that are very often of poor quality and out of character with the surrounding streetscape.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council, having regard to these guidelines, is now preparing a north fringe action area plan in which I as a representative of Dublin North Central will be particularly interested. I congratulate it on its plan. In implementing these guidelines a massive new housing development is proposed for the north fringe of the city taking into account public transport availability and so on. Private housing will be provided as well as social and affordable housing. That will go a long way towards meeting the accommodation needs of my constituents. I wholeheartedly welcome it and look forward to a speedy construction of these houses.</P>
    <P>The position in Dublin City Council regarding the shared ownership loan scheme is that the maximum value of a house allowed to be purchased under this scheme is £140,000. The council will also allow an applicant to put a £10,000 gift on top of that bringing the permitted value up to £150,000. These increases were only announced over the past year or two. Unfortunately the scheme is hopeless from a Dublin point of view, having regard to house prices here. Very few people can avail of it because they simply cannot find a house within the permitted price range.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious situation with regard to the disabled person's grant. The problem lies with the delay in the processing of applications in Dublin City Council. Applications that were made last September still have not been acknowledged. In 2001 there were 674 applications for the essential repairs grant and 1,692 applications for the disabled person's grant. The council now says it needs to prioritise the applications because of the backlog and has suggested it will only deal with applications from terminally ill people. That is an absolute disgrace. Will people have to submit medical evidence to show they are terminally ill before their application will be dealt with? I urge the Minister to intervene with Dublin City Council to sort out this scandal. In many cases people were dead by the time permission was granted to build their necessary extensions or downstairs toilet facilities or whatever. This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The scheme for affordable housing is very good and must be implemented without delay. I am not sure if many houses have been provided under this scheme in the Dublin City Council area. It will be very popular once it is up and running. Dublin City Council has prepared its scheme of priorities to allocate these houses but until we get these houses constructed the scheme will not be particularly useful. We need to move without delay to get houses constructed under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to initiate a review of a number of schemes: the essential repairs grant, the disabled person's grant, the new house grant and the housing aid for the elderly scheme run by the health boards. There are many inconsistencies <Col N="58" /> between these various schemes which could all be brought together in one new targeted home improvement grant scheme. Such a new scheme could be much more flexible in dealing with the real needs of people. I suggest that is particularly urgent. Any new scheme should focus in on the elderly, especially with regard to the provision of heating. That is a serious issue for elderly people and I do not think the existing schemes deal with it adequately.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the role of voluntary housing associations. The Minister has supported and encouraged these in many ways over the last few years. Several voluntary housing associations operate within my constituency of Dublin North Central such as Sonas, HAIL, ALONE, NAFCO and Respond!, all of which provide first class accommodation for people. I welcome the support and encouragement which the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities have given to those associations. I suggest there is great scope to develop and promote this sector further with new initiatives.</P>
    <P>Social integration was referred to. This is particularly relevant in the context of the provision for 20% social and affordable housing. We should be under no illusions that this will be resisted fiercely when we try to implement it in our communities. At present, local authorities often buy back houses for social accommodation and if the community gets to know about it there is opposition. We need to explain the provisions of the Planning and Development Act in this regard and encourage social integration. It has been found to be constitutional and I believe public representatives have a role to play in accommodating that provision so that all our citizens can find suitable and adequate accommodation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on Second Stage yesterday with regard to Traveller dealers and traders. This has become a huge issue, particularly in the greater Dublin area. These Traveller dealers and traders cause a great deal of annoyance when they move in and take over private areas and the only way of moving them is by means of a High Court injunction. Very often, the proprietors will not take that course because of the expense involved. Accordingly, I totally support the Minister's initiative in this regard. We really need to ensure there are adequate laws in place to deal with this very serious issue in suburban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. If the Minister's approach to the provision of extra funding is genuine, then it is welcome. It will benefit some people who currently have no hope or opportunity of providing a home for themselves. However, I see nothing in the Bill or the present combination of programmes and measures to solve one of the greatest current scandals, namely, homelessness. One can walk from Leinster House in any direction after nine o'clock any evening and practically fall <Col N="59" /> over many unfortunate people who live in doorways along the streets, in cardboard boxes or similar makeshift material. That phenomenon here in Dublin is replicated elsewhere, including the Minister of State's home city of Galway. What is in this Bill or in all the measures which the Minister of State has mentioned that will in any way touch the lives of those people or their prospects of getting a home of their own? Sadly, I have to answer &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; and I greatly regret that.</P>
      <P>With regard to affordable housing, what does &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; mean? The concept is very welcome, but what confidence has the Minister of State about the delivery of affordable housing throughout all the local authority areas? Based on my own experience, there is a hesitancy, a lack of experience and a big question mark as to whether, if local authorities build or acquire such housing, they will be able to get people to take them up. Why do local authorities ignore the housing lists? For some reason, there is a hesitancy which I cannot understand. As Deputy Haughey mentioned, were it not for the voluntary agencies leading the way and the recognition of those endeavours by the Minister of State's Department, the concept of affordability in housing would be very limited indeed. The wonderful projections for the period of the NDP in the Minister's opening statement mean nothing. They are absolutely unachievable. The Minister of State may disagree but the reality is that there is a lack of determination to deliver results. What has he done to push local authorities to get down to providing the required housing? Galway County Council has 200 people on the waiting list and that figure is increasing rapidly because of the unaffordability of private housing.</P>
      <P>Because of the downturn and lack of confidence in the building industry in recent months, partially completed private housing developments have been lying unsold. Uncertainty reigned and nothing happened. The developers are now downloading large housing estates to local authorities. I had regarded it as encouraging that local authorities were changing from the system of large estates to smaller, more manageable and more intimate group housing developments. That trend is now being reversed. Under severe financial difficulties, developers have to off load to local authorities. In some cases local authorities have to buy out people who may have entered into contracts for some of the properties in large estates in order to bring the entire estate into the social and affordable housing category. By going back to the system of large housing estates, we are increasing the problems that we were trying to get away from. I ask the Minister of State to undertake a thorough investigation of what is happening in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some backbenchers on the Government side of the House spoke in glowing terms of the 20% social and affordable housing provision, but in <Col N="60" /> reality there is double-speak. Back in their own local authorities they are saying it will not work. They are first in line to object to social housing. The Minister of State knows them. The barriers which they have put up against the plans and schemes which the Minister of State is putting in place are well publicised.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the part played by the planning sections of local authorities with regard to housing in general and particularly in relation to social and affordable housing. Every barrier possible has been put in place. I am a member of a local authority. One of the first town development plans to be completed was for Loughrea. The scathing letter sent by the Minister of State's Department to those members who participated in the implementation of the development plan for Loughrea &ndash; it is on the record and the Minister should read it &ndash; is contradictory to what is happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>We were rapped on the knuckles for the outrageous amount of land being proposed. Why? We designated land in Loughrea for commercial, industrial, residential and amenity rezoning. It was the first time land in Loughrea had been rezoned for amenity and recreational development. The reality is that Galway is encroaching on the county boundaries. It is acquiring land in the county area for industrial rezoning. Despite decentralisation IDA Ireland does not have, in its landbanks, any land in Loughrea for the location of new industrial developments. The Minister continues to say that we cannot designate land for industrial development. The Department is operating in a confused manner and must be co-ordinated. The message filtering down to local authorities is also confusing. What can they do? Should they leave things in abeyance or let them progress without focus?</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that an opportunity was missed to locate industry in areas which previously had none. Such a move would have brought additional housing and all the other facilities needed for the proper and planned development of any community. Without proper structures, co-ordination and organisation the Department will not be able to meet the Government's plan to develop 41,000 units during its lifetime in Government. It is unachievable.</P>
      <P>On housing grants, if anyone in the Department understood the reality of life for young people building houses&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;he or she would examine the futility of the current restrictions under the new house grants scheme. It is useless. Perhaps the Minister will supply the statistics for those applying for the new house grant. How many such people are there? There has been a sharp decline in this area over the past ten years. A <Col N="61" /> grant of £3,000 is meaningless given the overall cost of building a house. No one will stay within the floor area limits required for eligibility for the grant because the cost of building an extension at a future date will be enormous. The Minister should abandon the grant or increase it substantially. Every couple who buy or build houses of their own free up a place on the housing waiting list. That list is, unfortunately, growing each day because of the inability of many couples to provide housing for themselves. Over the past five or ten years there has been an easing in the availability of loans for young people and a resulting buoyancy in new house building. However, we have stepped back five years in the past couple of months and that is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>On spatial strategy, restrictions are being imposed by planners and consultants who are feeding off the Department. We are aiding and abetting the depopulation of rural Ireland. That is the reality whether we accept it. I do not know if that is what was intended by those who think of spatial strategy as fully orientated in a Pale mentality. They do not think beyond Dublin or a few miles outside it.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State should substantially increase the floor area within which people can build and be eligible for the grant. People are not building mansions, they are simply liveable units. We were all restricted by resources in the past. People are now prepared to invest in comfort for themselves and their families and they need recognition for providing their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the facility whereby a person leaving a local authority house is very generously recognised by the Department in the changeover to providing their own home. I cannot, however, reconcile that with the position of those who undertake to provide their own home, at great demand to their income, in the first instance. People leaving local authority houses and providing themselves with new homes receive £9,000, yet those buying their first homes <Col N="62" /> receive only £3,000. That is unjustifiable. The Minister should substantially increase the new house buyer's grant &ndash; Deputy Haughey referred to this earlier.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board, I very much appreciate the housing grant for the elderly. There is a great need, because of the profile and structure of the population in the west, to respond generously and the Minister has made a positive response in that regard which I gratefully acknowledge. It is probably the best scheme in terms of value and I will explain why. A health board issues an application form which is subsequently processed and the person is told to get estimates for completion of the work. The person should make sure the contractor doing that work has a C3 and that their taxes are in order. Then the job is done with a cost-effective return. Unfortunately, if one compares that with any of the schemes operated by the local authority one gets into the realm of red tape as highlighted by many Deputies in past few days. Many people, including engineers, medical people, observers, overseers and goodness knows who else must come out to examine things. Why must there be such delays in the process? Very often, and very tragically, the applicant is dead before the work is carried out.</P>
    <P>These are good schemes in so far as they upgrade living conditions for people. We are talking about people with disabilities, who are protesting outside Leinster House today, and people who have suffered the trauma of waiting for basic facilities to be provided by the local authority because of the uncertainty of grants and money available to them. They are entitled to that money as of right and the delay is humiliating to them and to their spouses or siblings who look after and care for them in all instances.</P>
    <P>A previous Fianna Fáil led Government disbanded the reconstruction grant scheme that was in place a few years back. The first thing Fianna Fáil did when it came into Government was to disband the scheme. It rings hollow in my ears when I hear backbench Fianna Fáil Deputies calling for its introduction. They are doing so because there is an election in the offing and they want to be all things to all people. Yet they were the people who disbanded these very good schemes. Not only were they good schemes but they improved the housing status for many throughout the country, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is no justification to say the scheme had to be abandoned because it cost too much due to doctors, solicitors and Deputies securing new windows and doors for people. Was there no facility to correct the anomalies in the scheme while allowing it to continue as an important support to the many people who wanted to upgrade their housing? This is important and I support all the calls from the Government benches for a new reconstruction grant scheme. However, it rings hollow when I know that the same Deputies sup<Col N="63" /> ported the abandonment of that scheme a few years ago.</P>

If we are to succeed in the delivery of anything like the number the Minister spoke of, there has be to be an enthusiastic push from the Department towards the local authorities to say that we are confident we can deliver houses for the people who want them. The &euro;6 billion to be provided during the lifetime of that plan, if delivered, is to be welcomed, but it will never come to fruition unless there is leadership in the housing sector. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, has failed to lead that initiative to deliver on the ground.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill. It gives us an opportunity to talk about housing and the needs of so many people. I will not call for the re-introduction of the house improvements scheme but I would like the essential repair grant, which is a worthwhile scheme covering re-roofing and chimney repairs etc., extended to include windows and doors where there is a genuine need for them, particularly amongst old people and in old houses. Currently the scheme, while worthwhile, is very rigid. Many county councils say it is only available to those aged 65 and over. That system needs to be loosened up because we already have housing aid for the elderly which covers people aged 65 and upwards. I understand that in some counties the county managers or the housing officers are very flexible while in others they are very strict on the 65 year age limit. That needs to be seriously examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every county, including Wexford, needs a plentiful supply of housing for those on the local authority housing list. The duplication on local authority housing lists between urban and county councils sometimes baffles me. It smacks of laziness by local authorities which are not able to sort out whether people are on dual lists. I know of recent cases where people who came before a council for re-housing had already bought their own houses or had been re-housed by another local authority. It is necessary to examine how to keep a list relevant to what is happening at a particular time. Local authorities, particularly housing officers, need to be prodded and poked <Col N="64" /> to make sure the list is as it should be and is not exaggerated because of laziness.</P>
    <P>In relation to rent subsidies, which were mentioned by a number of speakers and are an essential part of looking after those in need of re-housing, I have serious concerns about them being paid to landlords who provide substandard houses and flats while charging exorbitant rates. In the small town of Enniscorthy it is now £125 per week to rent and, in some cases, one would not put a dog in the type of place available. The health board subsidises this although it may have no choice. However, the standard of housing provided by landlords needs to be inspected on a regular basis and landlords need to be forced to spend some of the exorbitant profits they make from tenants on bringing their property up to date. It is an area that should be seriously looked at.</P>
    <P>I know that if builders presented 20% of their land for affordable housing, they got higher densities. However, we must also consider the need for playgrounds and play parks. Rather than calling for the introduction of grants for house repairs, there should be grant aid available to local authorities for the provision of playgrounds. At the moment, Enniscorthy Urban Council is in the process of building a playground that will cost in the region of £70,000. It is only a small playground because of the cost of equipment. There should be grant aid from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to help the local authority because small local authorities are not in a position to provide the number of playgrounds needed in large extended urban areas. I understand that something like this was mooted by the Minister last year but never got under way, and I urge him to look at it.</P>
    <P>Planning permission is a big issue with every member of a local authority at the moment. The Minister will probably reply that the development plan belongs to the local authority, and it is true that was the case in my area when Wexford County Council passed the county development plan last July. However, its interpretation by five different planners in the county is ridiculous. In one part of the county the planning officer will grant planning permission for a single house but in another part such permission will not be granted. They will not allow brick, dormer, two-storey or bungalow house. Planning is a joke at present. There is no doubt that many people are going on to the housing lists because they have been refused planning permission. It may not be within the remit of the Minister of State to do anything about it but county managers and key planning officers must be more consistent.</P>

        <b>: </b>Most of the planners are only out of college. They are very talented but they are unaware of the practicalities on the ground. Some rural areas are being turned into <Col N="65" /> wildlife reserves because no one is allowed to live in them. The Government talks about rural renewal and development and keeping people in rural areas while the planners make sure very few people will live there in the future.</P>
      <P>In Enniscorthy, in an estate called Andy Doyle Close, which I call the one-stop-shop of housing estates, there are private sites, affordable housing, social housing and private housing in one complex, as well as land purchased by Enniscorthy UDC. It is a tremendous scheme that could be copied in other places. The people who live in the Respond voluntary housing schemes and other such schemes are unable to buy their houses and they are annoyed about this.</P>

        <b>: </b>Projects are approved by councils but rejected by the Department. It is not entirely the fault of the Department because there is a lack of knowledge in certain councils as to what the Department will accept for voluntary housing. A circular defining what is acceptable to the Department of the Environment and Local Government should be published and distributed.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this is a worthwhile scheme. There are 150 houses in Enniscorthy that have been built by voluntary organisations and they complement the local authority lists. Wexford is one of the better counties for building houses. In a housing report published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in September, it was stated that in 1999 132 houses were completed in Wexford while in 2001 there were 250 completions, an increase of 100%.</P>
      <P>The Government is making money available for the building of houses but it is important that local authorities look for available land. When Enniscorthy UDC or Wexford County Council looks for money to build houses there is never a problem if the schemes are ready. The two local authorities will allocate 50 houses by the end of April and there are plans with the Department for another 50 houses. If the schemes are prepared and planning permission granted, the Department will grant the money, and I thank the Minister for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new house grant of £3,000 has been mentioned. Unlike most Deputies in the House, I do not think this should be increased. Most people who come to me are looking for planning per<Col N="66" /> mission for a new house of 2,500 or 3,000 square feet. Everyone wants to build a mansion these days even though the average sized family consists of a husband, wife and two children. When I tell someone that will cause the loss of the grant, they are not worried. Perhaps the Minister will adjust the new house grant to cover second-hand houses. People who buy second-hand houses are at the lower end of the income scale and a second-hand house grant of £3,000 would be a major help. I would not, however, be in favour of increasing the new house grant because no one wants to avail of it &ndash; that is obvious from the size of the houses they are building.</P>
    <P>Housing aid for the elderly, the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant are all worthwhile but there are delays in getting these schemes off the ground. In recent years there have been problems finding builders because there are so many large scale housing developments throughout the State that builders do not want to do small jobs anymore. It has been difficult, therefore, to get the two or three quotations upon which the council has insisted. This area should be streamlined and made more easily available to people.</P>
    <P>There are major problems in county councils in relation to the disabled person's grant. To get an occupational therapist to examine the needs of a person takes a long time while to get the area engineer to come out is nearly impossible. These are people who may require an extension or a change of bathroom facilities because of disability. It is vital they are not kept waiting.</P>
    <P>When a builder completes a scheme he hands it over to the council, and that is an efficient way to make housing available. There are, however, problems within the Department with the types of schemes and some problems in local authorities about how this should be done. A combination of turnkey schemes, affordable housing, social housing and private sites can make inroads into the difficulties we are experiencing.</P>
    <P>Many councils in the 1970s and 1980s acquired substantial land banks but these are now running out. The county managers and directors of services feel a reluctance to purchase land because of high costs. If they do not buy it this year, it will be more expensive next year and certainly more expensive the year after that. If the Government is returned to power, it will encourage local authorities to buy as much land as possible. Land banks are an essential part of the house building programme and the Minister should put pressure on the councils to purchase land that is available.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the opportunity to raise these issues and hope he will take them on board. I thank him for the number of housing starts made in Enniscorthy in the past few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's view on the condition and status of al-Qaeda prisoners being held by the US is clear. All detained persons are entitled to the protection of international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law. This must be the case irrespective of the prisoners' exact status. Where doubts have been raised regarding the status of prisoners, such as those held in Guantanamo Bay, the Third Geneva Convention provides for their status to be determined by a tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have emphasised this view in both public and private discussions. I have privately discussed the matter in Tokyo with UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, who has conveyed the same message to the US authorities. I also met the chairman of the Afghan interim authority, Hamid Karzai, and conveyed my concerns. I further discussed the issue with my European Union counterparts, most recently at the General Affairs Council on 28 January.</P>
      <P>The US authorities are well aware of the Government's position which was conveyed to US ambassador, Richard Haass, during his visit to Dublin on 15 January. There is no doubt that the United States is very conscious of the level and nature of international concern about the treatment and status of al-Qaeda prisoners. Deputies will be aware of statements by senior US administration representatives which make clear the US commitment that the prisoners will be treated humanely, but which have fallen short of accepting their status in relation to the Third Geneva Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross has been given access to the prisoners, and that it will have a permanent presence in Guantanamo, as long as there are <Col N="68" /> detainees to be registered on arrival and subsequently visited. I again call on the US authorities to implement quickly and fully the ICRC's recommendations in regard to the conditions in which the prisoners are being held.</P>
    <P>In all contacts with the US authorities on the issue we have been assured that they are keenly aware of their obligations under international humanitarian law, and that they will live up to these obligations. In expressing these views I do so as a friend of the United States. The Government recognises the danger posed by terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda. However, in confronting those who abuse and violate all forms of human rights it is essential that we maintain the highest standards at all times, including through scrupulous respect for international law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the war on terrorism led by the United States, but I am concerned that the zeal to tackle terrorism cannot and must not be extended to deny human rights to prisoners. In fact, I would see this as being counterproductive. Now that the Red Cross is represented at Guantanamo Bay, is the Minister satisfied that there is full observance of human rights as far as the prisoners are concerned?</P>
      <P>I would like to raise two points in relation to the prisoners' status. First, the Minister said there is a procedure for a tribunal to examine that status, but who will establish that tribunal and what happens if it is not established? Second, does the Minister see any distinction between those who were foreign members of the al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan, as opposed to Afghanis who are Taliban prisoners? Does he consider that there is a clear distinction between those two categories, in that it is hard to suggest that an Afghani person who was in the Taliban was not entitled to engage in support for what he or she considered to be the then lawful government of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is aware of widespread concern about the conditions under which al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners were being transported to and detained in the US naval facility in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. As I have already outlined, the Government has raised these concerns with the US authorities and we have been assured that the United States is aware of and will live up to its obligations, meeting the highest standards of justice and humane treatment for the prisoners. As to whether they are entitled to prisoner of war status, as the Deputy knows, the United States has clearly set out the reason it has termed the prisoners unlawful combatants. Many legal experts have expressed doubts about this classification. The Government hopes the US authorities are giving careful consideration to the possibility of having their status determined by a competent tribunal as provided for under international law in Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention. We must remember that for the prisoners the need to be treated humanely is their <Col N="69" /> most immediate concern. The Government considers that the presence of the ICRC will help to ensure their treatment meets international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions under which the International Committee of the Red Cross functions is that it can only report confidentially to those who are detaining prisoners or to the representatives of the prisoners. It is a condition of its access that it issues no public statement. Given this, how can the Minister possibly stand over the reply given by the Spanish EU Presidency to a question concerning the reason it is not seeking access to establish the conditions under which European Union citizens are being held? What efforts has the Minister made to secure access so as to establish the conditions?</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted certain international legal opinion suggesting that the conditions of Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention are being met. A great body of published opinion has suggested that the prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay should be accorded prisoner of war status. On what basis are they being disqualified from having such status?</P>
      <P>Whether we are to believe it, everybody prefaces their remarks on this issue by saying they are making these demands in the spirit of friendship and friendly relations between nations. Is it not an outrage that one permanent member of the UN Security Council can seek to interpret in its own way the terms of the Third Geneva Convention? Yet, it is assumed that the other 189 signatories to the convention, who are not on the Security Council, must accept it as writ. Either it is law or it is not. Is the Minister concerned that there has been no public statement on his behalf, or on behalf of the Government and the European Union, that these prisoners are not being accorded the terms of Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention? Deputy Jim O'Keeffe correctly pointed out that if there is doubt, the convention explicitly states a competent tribunal must decide the matter. What assurance does the Minister have that this will be done? What form will the tribunal take and will it be within the terms of international law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true for the Deputy to say that I am not on the public record as to stating what the precise position of the Government is, even with regard to the question of Article 5, because I am. I have been explicit concerning that matter. Where there is doubt &ndash; such doubt is being raised &ndash; in relation to the status of the prisoners concerned, under Article 5, it is a matter for a competent tribunal to make that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but when is this to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made the point to the detaining country that this is something we <Col N="70" /> believe should happen. We still await the outcome of the point of view we have expressed, which is not unique to us, but also comes from many other members of the international community. Therefore, it is not correct to say we have not stated clearly the Government's position on the matter; we have been explicit.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out the advice available to me on the question of legal status, which is important. Both the United States of America and Afghanistan are parties to the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 which relates to the treatment of prisoners of war &ndash; the United States having become a party in 1955 and Afghanistan in 1956. While the Taliban had not been recognised as a legitimate government of Afghanistan by the international community, the rights and obligations imposed by the Third Genera Convention still apply to Afghanistan. This is because the convention operates between states, not governments. The Geneva Conventions apply in &ldquo;all cases of war or any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties&rdquo; and in &ldquo;all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a high contracting party.&rdquo;  That relates to Article 2.</P>
      <P>In Article 4 of the convention a prisoner of war is defined as a person who has fallen into the power of the enemy, including &ldquo;members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict, as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.&rdquo;  On this basis, members of the Taliban forces, as the armed forces of Afghanistan when captured, would qualify for prisoner of war status.</P>
      <P>The status of al-Qaeda forces under the above mentioned paragraph would depend on whether they could be seen to be a &ldquo;militia or volunteer corps&rdquo; forming part of the forces of Afghanistan. The precise relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda forces is not precisely known and contended. However, paragraph 2 of Article 4 of the convention provides that captured members of other militias and other volunteer corps linked to the armed forces of a state may qualify for prisoner of war status providing they fulfil certain conditions, including having &ldquo;a distinctive sign recognisable at a distance&rdquo; and &ldquo;carrying their arms openly.&rdquo;  It could be argued that the al-Qaeda forces fulfilled neither of these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, when there is a doubt as to the status of prisoners Article 5 of the convention requires that those prisoners enjoy the protection of the convention until their status has been determined by a &ldquo;competent tribunal&rdquo;. While a competent tribunal is not defined in the convention, a tribunal should possess judicial features and operate in a judicial way, that is, it should be impartial and willing to consider a prisoner's claim to be a prisoner of war. Should a prisoner be found by a competent tribunal not to qualify as a prisoner of war, it should be pointed out that such a person is still entitled to the protection accorded by international standards of human rights, including those contained in the International Covenant of <Col N="71" /> Civil and Political Rights to which the United States is a party, which guarantee that no one be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is also a principle of international humanitarian law that where no provision exists which regulates a particular case, the principles of international law as they result from the practice of civilised nations shall prevail. It should be pointed out that the granting of prisoner of war status to a person does not prevent that person from being tried for war crimes or other crimes by the detaining power. That is the outline detailed legal position with which all of our public pronouncements are consistent with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has proved the point I raised, that there is a distinction between the Taliban prisoners and the al-Qaeda prisoners. Whatever question there might be about the status of foreign al-Qaeda fighters who were captured in Afghanistan, there can be no question whatsoever about the status of an Afghan Taliban fighting in his own country. That point should be made to the Americans. As believers in the rule of law we must be insistent on its being observed.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister fully satisfied that the interrogation procedures are in accordance with the rule of law? The photographs taken of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay have been quite disturbing to the general public. These photographs seem to have emanated from official sources which appear to take pleasure in producing them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am waiting for the Minister's explicit reply as to why the Presidency of the European Union is not seeking access to assure compliance with the Geneva Convention. I know the Minister has as much respect as I have for the Geneva Convention. He referred to chapters four and five of the Third Geneva Convention. I remind him that irrespective of this, under international customary and humanitarian law, all prisoners are entitled, as he rightly points out in his reply, to be treated in a civilised manner. My question is a simple one: why did the Spanish Presidency of the European Union issue a statement saying that it was not in a position to form an opinion as to whether there was compliance with the convention? It also stated that it does not dispose of the information necessary to determine whether the detainees at Guantanamo Bay should be regarded as prisoners of war. This is a weak statement on the Presidency's behalf, a presidency which has said it is going full steam ahead for the co-ordination of foreign and security policy. Has the Minister pressed the Spanish Presidency to seek access?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question about information gathering. There seems to be an acceptance in certain areas that one need not adhere to certain standards for the purpose of <Col N="72" /> gathering information to be used in an anti-terrorist effort. I remind the Minister that this is perilously close to the case of Castlereagh stated by Ireland against the United Kingdom in the 1970s. Some of the pictures showing the hooding of prisoners and their removal for questioning are much worse than in the case of Castlereagh. As a member of the General Affairs Council, why is the Minister happy with the European Union's gutless approach of not seeking access in order to establish the facts? What efforts does the Minister propose to assure himself that it is within the principles of international law?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I would make about the statements made by the Spanish Presidency is that I am making the same point here as I did at the General Affairs Council. Concern about EU citizens is a matter which is being taken up bilaterally by the governments of the states whose citizens are held. They have informed me that they have been able to obtain <i>de facto</i> consular status in respect of investigating the position of their citizens. The United Kingdom is a case in point. It dealt directly with the US in order to satisfy itself as to the position of its own citizens. Access was obtained on a bilateral basis.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's <i>bona fides</i>. He is as interested as I am in getting the Treaty of Nice through and ensuring the process of enlargement is not impeded by Ireland. Accepting our respective <i>bona fides</i>, does the Minister agree with my fundamental point that it is necessary to put in place measures which are visible and open to the public in advance of further referenda? If we believe there is something to be done on neutrality by way of a White Paper, an EU declaration or an amendment to the Defence Acts, these should be put in place now. If it is necessary to improve democratic accountability and make changes in relation to how proposals from Europe are considered by the Oireachtas or its committees, these should be in operation now. The implementation of any such actions is delayed because of what is happening at the Forum on Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is simply highlighting the fact that we have a complete difference of view in relation to this matter. The Deputy continues to impress upon me an approach which he favours and with which this Government does not agree; namely that we await the interim report of the Forum on Europe before putting before the Dáil the exact proposals and the discussions we will have with the EU institutions what exact proposals we will have in relation to the questions to be put before the end of 2002. I do not accept the contention that not doing so now involves any unwarranted delay. If the Deputy were present at the forum's deliberations he would see that the forum is succeeding in distilling the areas of concern which are relevant to the Treaty of Nice. There are other issues about the future of Europe which are not germane to the treaty. The structured debate which is taking place in the forum is providing us with that necessary distillation. As the Deputy is aware, there was a range of reasons for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote and the abstention vote which had nothing to do with the Treaty of Nice. The Deputy's party took a different view and continues to impress upon me that I am not going its way; I am not going its way because the Government came to a different decision which was supported by a greater majority of people in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the consequence of that Government decision is to delay the implementation of a number of measures that should be put into effect? Our time is short as it is likely that this House will not be meeting beyond the end of next month. There will be an election, then the formation of a new Government followed by the summer recess. There is a lengthy period required for the referendum process from the point of view of the legislation. There will be no time for new legislation to amend the Defence Act and the putting in place of measures to reform the way we deal with EU measures in this House and in the committees of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> Should we not agree this plan of action and put it into effect so when we go back to the people we can say we have learnt from the Nice treaty process, have changed our procedures and are in a position to submit to them the treaty in a different package? Is the Minister not losing the opportunity to put that into effect because of continuing delay?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that any opportunity has been lost by us taking careful consideration of what the forum is doing on this question. This is where both our parties differ and there is not much point in continuing with debate on this aspect because in our analysis the question of a coherent response to the issues raised by the referendum is best awaited until after the forum has considered this aspect of its deliberations. At that point a greater consensus on these matters will emerge in the House. In view of the polarised debate on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; sides during the referendum, I have had the opportunity in the forum to discuss matters directly with people like Deputy Gormley, who has described the debate as helpful and realistic. There is much common ground if we could only deal with the substance of the issues rather than dwell on worst case scenarios which are not germane or relevant to the deliberations, especially in view of the kind of national interest that is involved.</P>

      <P>I am gravely concerned at the continuing loss of life in the Palestinian territories and Israel and deeply regret the substantial damage done to infrastructure in the Palestinian territories in Israeli retaliatory attacks and raids. This concern has been expressed on numerous occasions by the European Union and its member states. The European Union is engaged in a vigorous and continuous effort with all parties concerned to encourage a resumption of the peace process.</P>
      <P>The incoming President of the Council of Ministers, Josep Piqué, visited the region in mid-January and heard the views of all the major actors. He also took the opportunity to outline the position of the European Union. The Belgian and other EU Presidency Foreign Ministers also visited the region on several occasions as have numerous Foreign Ministers from various member states, including Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months I have met many of the most important regional actors, including the Presidents and Foreign Ministers of Egypt and Israel and the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, <Col N="75" /> to discuss the situation. I have also had the opportunity to discuss the situation with US Secretary of State Powell and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. In October, together with the Taoiseach, I received President Arafat in Dublin. There is also frequent telephone contact between European Ministers and US, Israeli and Arab leaders.</P>
    <P>The European Union's High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana, and the EU Special Envoy for the Middle East Peace Process, Ambassador Miguel Moratinos, are in constant contact with all parties to the conflict and are frequent visitors to the region. The EU also tries to co-ordinate its positions with those of other international actors. Last week Mr. Solana met in Washington with senior members of the US administration to exchange ideas for moving the situation forward. He also met special envoys of the United States, the Russian Federation and the Secretary General of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Future EU policy towards the Middle East will be one of the major topics for discussion at the Informal Meeting of Foreign Ministers this weekend and I expect that a wide-ranging review of possible policy options will take place. On the question of the destruction of infrastructure, the Spanish President of the Council of Ministers has written to the Foreign Minister of Israel expressing our concern at the damage done to facilities provided by the European Union and its member states, urging an end to these acts.</P>
    <P>It is clear that progress in the Middle East can only come about through the establishment of mutually reinforcing political and security measures. These measures are set out in the Mitchell Report. The recommendations of Mitchell must be taken in their entirety. There is no room for either side to select those measures which appeal to it and avoid those which carry a cost. To present the current problem as one of security alone is to avoid the real issue. Terrorism is indeed a problem in the Middle East but the Middle East problem is not one of terrorism. I call on both sides to take the political and security measures, which they know are necessary, to rebuild the partnership which alone can lead to a just and comprehensive final settlement.</P>

Has the Union been made aware of the appalling susceptibility in so many places to the destruction of olive groves, teachers' houses and the obstruction of teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that Prime Minister Sharon invokes the same rhetoric as President Bush and that the suggestion that President Arafat lacks credibility as a partner in dialogue has been deeply damaging to the Middle East <Col N="76" /> peace process? Given that and the reluctance of the United States to become involved as a fair broker in the region, does the Minister agree it has become more urgent for the European Union to take direct action with regard to the different parties? Given Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council, is the suggestion that the United Nations become involved &ndash; rejected by Israel &ndash; still a proposal at the Security Council as part of Irish foreign policy? Given the stalling of the peace process, the number of civilian deaths, especially of young children, and the destruction of infrastructure, what reason is there for not taking United Nations action in the region and for pressing more strongly for it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past 12 to 18 months the European Union has had a growing influence, especially given that there were three Europeans on the Mitchell commission which considered the situation in the aftermath of the renewed<i> intifada</i> and the death and destruction that has since occurred. As we have seen in our peace process, when Governments work together &ndash; in this case the Middle East governments, the United States government and the European Union &ndash; hand in hand, based on the Mitchell report and the detailed security arrangements which are aligned with the political moves that must be made following the report, it creates the best prospect of bringing the necessary pressure on all sides to move forward.</P>
      <P>I have expressed the view at the General Affairs Council that it is timely for the European Union to take a strategic review of its role with regard to the Middle East on the basis that it would appear that our ability to work effectively in pursuing the Mitchell report, together and consistently with the United States, is something we must consider. From the point of view of the Union, there is serious frustration at the failure to recognise that European Union assistance is providing the means by which the Palestinian Authority can maintain its viability. The attack on assets that are funded and provided by the European Union assistance programme was considered at the GAC and in its conclusions the right to seek reparation was reserved. This signalled to the Israeli Government that this policy cannot continue with impunity and without consequence.</P>
      <P>The destruction of olive trees, the poisoning of wells and other such activity is punitive and greatly exacerbates an already deteriorating situation. The need for political direction on all sides on the activities of the military is essential. The primacy of the political power and authority must be upheld and maintained in all circumstances. I have heard stated the detail of the destruction involved. It does not come to the attention of the international media but it has a huge impact on providing any kind of decent quality of life for Palestinians on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to review strategically the European Union position. If there is a view that the support <Col N="77" /> by the United States Government for the position of Prime Minister Sharon is such as to lessen from our perspective its effectiveness as a broker between both sides, then the European Union must take that into account in terms of where it will position itself to ensure there is progress.</P>
    <P>If the US and the EU can agree on the implementation of a common position <i>à la</i> Mitchell that greatly increases the prospect of political movement. In the event of that not being available the EU must review its position to the maximum advantage in the interests of upholding the integrity of the process. The strong view of the Irish Government is that President Arafat remains an indispensable partner in this process. The absence of trust on both sides is militating against any prospect of a sustained step by step approach that would lead us out of this spiralling conflict.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the two governments brought forward our package of proposals to address the key outstanding aspects of the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; policing, decommissioning, demilitarisation and stability in the institutions &ndash; last August, we have been able to make progress across the range of issues, and matters have been considerably advanced.</P>
      <P>Following the election of David Trimble and Mark Durkan as First and Deputy First Ministers respectively on 6 November, we have enjoyed a sustained period of full and inclusive operation of the institutions. On 30 November, the Taoiseach hosted highly productive summit level meetings of both the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council in Dublin Castle. On 17 December, together with the First and Deputy First Ministers, I attended the first meeting of the NSMC in its Institutional Format &ndash; designed, under the Agreement, to address institutional and cross-sectoral matters &ndash; in Stormont.</P>
      <P>The new Policing Board, established on 4 November, has made an impressive start. In reaching agreement before Christmas on a design for the badge of the new policing service, it has already demonstrated that it is not only prepared to address sensitive issues, but is able to reach cross-community consensus on a way forward. This bodes extremely well for the future. Like many others, I look forward to the day when the board is fully inclusive and when all parties play their full part on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most immediate issues facing the Policing Board is the follow-up to the Policing Ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan's, report into the Omagh bombing. The report raises serious issues of concern and it is essential that the six recommendations she makes be addressed satisfac<Col N="78" /> torily. In respect of the investigation, I stated my view some time ago that the Ombudsman's recommendation that an outside independent officer be tasked with its conduct should be accepted. However, it will be for the Policing Board to find a way forward which enjoys maximum confidence across the community, particularly with the families concerned.</P>
    <P>Further steps have also been taken towards the achievement of a normal security environment in the North. In addition to the measures identified at Weston Park, the British Government recently announced the removal of the military installation at Glasdrumman in South Armagh, and the closure of Ebrington Barracks in Derry. These are further welcome steps which will, I hope, be built upon in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>There have also been less positive developments. Despite the decision of the Glenbryn residents to bring their protest at Holy Cross School in Ardyone to an end in November, the new year saw serious disturbances and rioting in the surrounding areas. The callous murder of postal worker, Danny McColgan, on 12 January was profoundly shocking, reminding us of the deep wells of sectarianism that continue to exist in some quarters.</P>
    <P>The best way to ensure such views do not gain ground, is to demonstrate to both communities that their fundamental best interests are protected now, and in the future, through the implementation in full of the Good Friday Agreement. We will continue in our efforts, with the British Government and with the pro-Agreement parties, to secure that outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his positive reply in which he emphasised the progress made. Will the Minister join me in welcoming the reported statement of Gerry Adams in New York during the week in which he finally accepted that consent is the only way in which a united Ireland will be brought about and ruled out the use of force against the Unionists to bring about a united Ireland? Will the Minister agree that in such circumstances there is no excuse and no justification for maintaining an illegal army and that that point should be brought to the attention of Mr. Adams? Will the Minister say whether on every occasion he meets representatives of the republican movement he still raises with them the issue of the disappeared which continues to be a festering sore, not only in relation to those relatives where the Provos have admitted responsibility but in the case of the Armstrong family in south Armagh where up to now the Provos have still refused to admit responsibility? Will he also agree that he should on every possible occasion raise with the republican delegations which come here so often, the issue of those whom its military wing has exiled not only from Northern Ireland but from the island of Ireland? Can he imagine what it is like for the relatives of a young fellow who was ordered out of Ireland because of alleged anti-social behaviour? He is not allowed <Col N="79" /> to return home while people who have been responsible for the most heinous crimes walk about freely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that what we see, as we try to resolve this conflict, is the explicit confirmation that the principles of consent and self-determination of the Good Friday Agreement are durable and inviolable. These principles are the basis on which the Good Friday Agreement has been brought forward and agreed between the Governments and the parties. Clearly the only way in which peace and reconciliation can be provided is by consent and not by coercion. That has been patently true in the 30 years of tragic conflict, some of the consequences of which, as outlined by Deputy Currie, are ample and continuing testimony to that. As a constitutional democrat I agree that the question of any illegal armies is one which is part of the resolution of this conflict, upon which there has been some historic progress and more progress needs to be made. It is important always to emphasise that progress on all of these issues can and is being made on the basis of full and speedy agreement in all its aspects rather than situations being used, one against another. It is a process which requires movement on all sides by everybody in respect of those areas where they have particular responsibility or particular influence.</P>
      <P>In relation to those unfortunate families who have not located their loved ones who have been murdered and those who cannot return to the country, the trauma for those families cannot be denied. Any genuine peace process must accommodate and satisfy the legitimate needs of those families. It is a matter to which we refer and will continue to refer as we try to bring about a situation where the implementation of this Agreement is bedded down in full and where all outstanding issues, of which there are many, can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. These are important issues and we continue to bring them to the attention of those who may have some influence in rectifying them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 59, and 84 to 87, inclusive together.</P>
      <P>I have addressed most of the issues raised in the Deputy's questions in the answer I gave to Priority Question No. 3, but I would like to respond to the other points he raises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards any possible modification of the <Col N="81" /> Treaty of Nice, it was made clear in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, including at the Gothenburg European Council, that although our partners are willing to contribute in every possible way to helping the Irish Government to find a way forward there is no question of re-opening the text of the treaty.</P>
    <P>With regard to preparations for the next intergovernmental conference, the Laeken Declaration describes the Convention on the Future of the European Union as providing, together with the outcome of national debates, &ldquo;a starting point for discussions in the Intergovernmental Conference&rdquo;. It is in the convention, therefore, that much of the substantive preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference will take place. Closer to the time, issues such as the precise agenda, organisation and timing of the Intergovernmental Conference will be for the European Council to decide.</P>
    <P>With respect to the question of the degree to which those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; last June have been persuaded to change their voting intentions, I do not believe it would be helpful or productive to engage in speculation of this nature at this time. The ratification of the Treaty of Nice is ultimately a question for the people of Ireland to decide. It is the duty of all of us who support the ratification of Nice and Ireland's continuing place at the core of the European Union to make a persuasive case to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan   Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive replies both today and at the committee yesterday. However, I remain slightly concerned by one issue. In the event that we fail to ratify the treaty in a future referendum, surely it would be a good idea for the Minister and his European colleagues to anticipate this eventuality by putting in place procedures to respond to it. I am aware that it would be inadvisable to allow this to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nevertheless, if it did transpire, what proposals are in place to deal with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no such proposals. As I stated last week when the matter was discussed, the European Union proceeds on the basis of the rule of law and the treaties. The Treaty of Nice was negotiated by the Heads of Government and ratified by all 14 other member states through a parliamentary procedure. Due to our constitutional requirements, ratification of the treaty, if it occurs, will be conducted by way of referendum. The international legal position is that, in the absence of one country ratifying it, the treaty falls. The suggestion that there is another unspoken way forward which will allow for implementation of the treaty is incorrect and it certainly will not occur by the end of 2002, which is when the applicant states will have concluded their negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea that everything will be hunky-dory one way or the other greatly minimises the damage which will be done to our national interests, <Col N="82" /> a point which I will consistently make. Suggestions to the contrary do not take into account the impact failure to ratify would have, not only on the European Union, but also the members thereof. This is not to say that other member states or citizens do not respect our democratic decision making. It is simply a fact of life. We need to face the fact that we will hold up the ratification of the Treaty of Nice if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The matter is vital and central to the national interest, so much so that I hope that on the next occasion it is put to the people the issues will be dealt with on their merits. The concerns people have about the future architecture of the European Union will, I hope, be dealt with in the proper forum, the Future of Europe debate. There is no question that enlargement can only proceed on the basis of the Treaty of Nice. It is the basis on which the negotiations by the 12 applicant countries are taking place. Although the negotiations are at various stages, ten countries are expected to complete them by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we make it clear that if the Treaty of Nice is rejected in the next referendum, we alone will be impeding or delaying enlargement? I do not wish to go over too much ground and will confine my remarks to one proposal which I floated recently. This is the idea of making a commitment to have an EU declaration incorporated as a protocol in a future treaty. Did the Taoiseach recently hint that he was inclined to a similar view? What is the Minister's view about following what is essentially the Danish precedent set at Maastricht?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is genuinely idle to speculate at this stage about what will be the ultimate Government proposal. People are putting forward many ideas and points of view for the purposes of debate, which is fine. They will all be taken into account when final decisions are taken by the Government. It is open to successive Governments to put forward different viewpoints. In case there are doubts, there is no question that the Deputy's first contention is correct &ndash; failure to ratify the Treaty of Nice will not allow enlargement to proceed as envisaged by the institutional arrangements agreed at Nice, which have been expressed in treaty form and must be ratified by all states.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that this matter has become more urgent in so far as modern technological developments have deliberately made weapons lighter in order that they can be carried by children and that one of the consequences has been an increase in the number of children involved in armed conflict? Surely Ireland's credibility as part of the group of Friends of the Special Representative is damaged by the fact that we have not ratified the optional protocol. What possible reason is there for this? The Minister may wish to inform the House that it is because we would have to raise the age at which people are recruited to the Defence Forces. Is it not a major source of embarrassment that we would participate in a group which advocates the protection of children while at the same time failing to ratify the instrument?</P>

      <P>No, it is not a source of embarrassment. It is an issue we need to deal with and resolve expeditiously. I met with the Special Representative in the United Nations when I attended the delayed General Assembly and, far from being embarrassed or our status being diminished, he is very appreciative of the genuine support we gave him, not just in terms of our political support but in the financial support we provided and continue to provide for his office.

The optional   protocol entered into force three months after the deposit of the tenth instrument of ratification on 12 February last. I am sorry we <Col N="85" /> are not in the first ten, but there are at least another 179 in the same position as us.</P>
      <P>On the more relevant question domestically regarding the Defence Forces, Defence Force regulations which give effect to the provisions of the Defence Act 1954, have been identified as requiring amendment should there be any change in policy with regard to, for example, recruitment. As I said in my initial reply, however, consideration of the obligations involved in ratification of the optional protocol has not yet reached a conclusion and no recommendation has yet been put to the Government on amending legislation or any other issue. Up to 23% of some grades in the Army are under 18, and that is an issue we must take into account.</P>

      <P>On the question of ratification, will the Minister accept that we have a bad record from the point of view of ratifying international agreements? Is there a need for a new approach in that regard? In terms of the International Criminal Court, we signed our own convention about four years ago, we had the referendum last June and I cannot even get a list of the legislative administrative measures that need to be put in place to allow us to ratify the convention. Fifty of the 60 countries have already ratified so we will not be in the first batch. Does the Minister accept that it is not good for our name internationally that we sign these various agreements with good intent but then do not ratify them in reasonable time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an issue of Government priorities. The Members opposite have been in Government and they are aware of how we ensure we keep up to speed on the legal aspects of some of these matters, but once they are signed &ndash; the Taoiseach signed this particular protocol at the millennium summit &ndash; it is confirmation of our support for the substance of the issue. The question of clarification is important, and I do not diminish it, but we need to examine that in terms of the system itself. In the interest of advancing our international relations we sign many of these conventions, totally supportive of the principle, but the transposition of those into our domestic law, if necessary, or how they impact on existing laws is a matter we must recognise. There is no point in proceeding blindly with a ratification process and then finding out we are in contravention of existing domestic legislation which needs to be tidied up as well. This is an issue that practising politicians who give political instruction on a whole range of issues have with the system in a whole range of areas. We would like to see it being more effective but there is not a specific delay in regard to this protocol. It is not a case of everyone else having ratified it. I take the point, however.</P>

      <P>The question of the status, which is equally important, is one upon which there has not been agreement as to how to proceed because of the United States position.

The according of prisoner of war status does not deny the possibility of those prisoners being tried for war crimes or other crimes by the detaining power in due course but in the meantime, in terms of a treatment regime, the permanent presence of the International Red Cross is a guarantee that the treatment issues will be dealt with and the US has given a commitment that the treatment issue will be in accordance with that.

On the basis of that paragraph, members of the Taliban forces, as the armed forces of Afghanistan when captured, would qualify in our view for prisoner of war status and the status of al-Qaeda forces under the above-mentioned paragraph would depend on whether they could be seen to be &ldquo;a militia or volunteer corps&rdquo; forming part of the forces of Afghanistan. The precise relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda forces is not known and the doubt that arises out of that, in compliance with the convention, is best resolved by a competent tribunal being set up and adjudicating on it.</P>

What is the current situation as regards the implementation of paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Weston Park agreement, which relate to the appointment of a judge to deal with the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen, Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Pat Finucane, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright? Paragraph 19 of the agreement states that &ldquo;the investigation of each individual case will begin no later than April 2002&rdquo;. Is such a date still a realistic deadline? Has the Minister encouraged Sinn Féin representatives during his contacts with them to change their view on the policing authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary of State and I have discussed on several occasions the appointment of a judge of international standing to undertake an investigation into the cases of Patrick Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and others, as promised at Weston Park. Irish officials are working to take the matter forward as quickly as possible. I am mindful that we stated at Weston Park that the investigation should begin no later than April 2002, but while various names have been mentioned as possible leaders of the investigation, the Governments have not yet agreed on someone who is both available and willing to take up such a position. Candidates have to possess a certain level of experience and must have the trust and confidence of the families. It is important that they have expertise in the field of human rights. It has not been easy to locate, identify or get the agreement of an eminent judicial international personage to act as an overseer. The decision taken on this matter at Weston Park was a highly important one and both Governments are highly committed to it. I am mindful that we hope to have the investigation up and running within two months and efforts will continue to that end.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's question on Sinn Féin, he will appreciate that it is the considered view of the Government that it would be best if all parties eligible for membership of the policing board took up their membership so that we can ensure that the new beginning envisaged by Patten will become a reality for everyone in the community.</P>

Departments in both jurisdictions have conducted detailed work to ensure that difficulties, for example in terms of entitlements, are adequately addressed. We need to make sure there are no blockages to mobility in appropriate circumstances. It was unfortunate that problems arose in relation to two positions which came up on the policing authority, but sufficient work has been done in the interim to ensure that the issue of prior training is addressed in the event of successful applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 10, 34 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware of the Government's very clear position regarding the US economic embargo against Cuba. Ireland is opposed to the embargo and wishes to see it brought to an end. Together with our partners in the EU, we have regularly supported the resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for its lifting, most recently on 27 November last when the resolution was carried by 167 votes in favour to three against, with three abstentions. It is hoped attention will be paid to the overwhelming majority voice of the General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that there was a limited easing of the embargo in October 2000, when the US Congress voted to approve measures lifting restrictions on the sale of food and medicines. Although US financial institutions remain prohibited from extending credits for sales to Cuba, this vote represented the first breach in the principle of the embargo. Cuba recently paid approximately $35 million to purchase food from US companies in the aftermath of Hurricane Mich<Col N="90" /> elle. While Cuban authorities have indicated that this was a once-off measure, it is nevertheless evidence that the partial relaxation of the embargo has, at least in this instance, had some positive benefits for the Cuban people. Ireland and the EU will continue to call for the embargo to be lifted in its entirety.</P>
    <P>As I have previously acknowledged, there is a perception of inconsistency between the position adopted by Ireland and its EU partners at the UN in opposition to the US economic embargo against Cuba, and the EU Common Position on Cuba which continues to find, in its regular evaluations of the situation in that country, that conditions are not yet ripe there for the establishment of the kind of special partnership which the EU maintains with other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. I contend that there is no such inconsistency. Unlike the US, the EU operates no sanctions against Cuba. On the contrary, member states carry on normal relations with Havana across the full spectrum of contacts, from trade to culture. In fact, the 15 member states have actively developed an economic relationship with the island so that the EU is now Cuba's leading foreign investor, principal trade partner, premier source of tourists, and largest provider of development aid and humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>The EU cannot yet advance beyond normal relations to the kind of special relationship represented by the structured co-operation agreements which have been negotiated with other countries in the region, although it wishes to do so. The co-operation agreements are partnerships based on shared values of respect for democracy and human rights. Regrettably, the authorities in Havana do not at this time share the Union's view of these values. In its most recent annual report on Cuba, Amnesty International stated that:</P>
    <P>Individuals and groups peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly continued to face repression. Some conditional releases of prisoners of conscience gave rise to hopes that the attitude of the Cuban Government towards dissidents might be thawing, but new sentences and a serious escalation in repression during the closing months of 2000 discouraged such optimism. Journalists, political opponents and human rights defenders were subjected to severe harassment. Several hundred people, at least 13 of whom were prisoners of conscience, remained imprisoned for political offences. The authorities continued to use short-term detention, house arrest, threats and harassment to stifle and discourage political dissent.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the EU General Affairs Council conducts a close and careful evaluation of the conditions in Cuba at regular six-monthly intervals. Following the latest assessment, the Council found, on 10 December last, that the situation in Cuba remains &ldquo;seriously wanting as <Col N="91" /> regards the recognition and application of civil and political freedoms and the refusal of the Cuban authorities to contemplate reforms leading to a political system based on those values&rdquo;. The Council, therefore, was on this occasion reluctantly obliged once again to renew the Common Position, pending a change in Cuban policy regarding human rights and freedoms which would enable Havana to accept the standards applied by the EU to all countries without any discrimination, wishing to have the kind of enhanced relationship with the Union inherent in an institutionalised co-operation agreement.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Council is encouraged by the fact that Havana, having suspended a long-standing political dialogue with the EU in April 2000, following the support by EU member states for a resolution critical of Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, recently agreed to renewal of dialogue. An initial meeting took place in December 2001, when the EU troika led by the Belgian Foreign Minister, Louis Michel, visited Havana. This renewed dialogue offers some hope that progress can be made in the coming period. The EU has made clear that it expects to see meaningful indications from the Cuban Government that it will move to respect international norms in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including for example the principles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. If Havana were to sign these two covenants and to respect their provisions, the way might well open up towards changes in the Common Position which could lead to the negotiation of a fully fledged, mutually beneficial co-operation agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister's reply, more than 90% of which deals with human rights in Cuba, I wish to ask him a simple question. If one was a Cuban citizen and one saw the greatest power in the world opposing a resolution carried in the General Assembly with 167 votes in favour, three against and three abstentions, and if one accepts that the economic blockade is in breach of international trade law and many principles of general international law, what incentive is there for the Cuban Government to renew the dialogue with enthusiasm?</P>
      <P>I support the advancement of human rights, but why is there no review of the Common Position which takes into account the obdurate insistence on the part of the US on an illegal blockade of Cuba? The Minister's reply placed great emphasis on those areas in which Cuba falls short, but why is there so little concern at the General Affairs Council at the continuation of a blockade which is recognised as illegal and which is so flagrantly in breach of international opinion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the details in that manner because I was asked to make a statement on the <Col N="92" /> changes in the EU's Common Position towards Cuba, which I favour. I made the point that the position has not been static, but there has been a renewal of dialogue. I made the specific suggestion that the signing of two covenants would further increase the prospect of changing the Common Position.</P>
      <P>I stated at the outset that we do not agree with the US embargo. The EU takes its own positions and does not have an embargo in place. Ireland is trading with Cuba and dealing with it bilaterally and in the context of the EU in terms of development assistance and so on. The focus of the question was whether the EU has any ideas as to how it might introduce some dynamic into the Common Position which might be helpful, and that is what I addressed.</P>
      <P>I disagree that there is an inconsistency in our position at the UN and in the EU because we do not support the embargo. We vote, but countries such as the US have a different view as regards bilateral relations with Cuba which goes back many presidencies. As a member of the EU, my job is to see what constructive proposals Ireland can make towards developing the Common Position. The enhanced partnership arrangements with Cuba will be dealt with in the same way as with other Latin American and Caribbean countries.</P>
      <P>There is a requirement regarding membership of the EU called the Copenhagen criteria and as regards our partnership arrangements under which these kind of values must also be addressed. This is not just an EU issue. Amnesty International has a view on this, but that does not mean I agree with the US position which is different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally disagree with the US position on this issue. The embargo is ridiculous. I agree with Deputy Higgins that it is in breach of international law. This changes the entire context. The embargo will go when Fidel Castro and Jesse Helms no longer have the control they now enjoy. The EU will then find itself in a ridiculous situation as the US embargo will have been lifted, but we will still have the Common Position. The EU should take the lead on this issue and make every effort to help draw Cuba into the full international arena. I am in favour of entering a co-operation agreement with Cuba as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the argument that we should change our position in the event a change in the US position. We have a position based on our values. If, as the Deputy contends, the US was going to reverse its policy overnight for the reasons he put forward, that is a matter for the US to explain, defend and deal with. I make no comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot criticise the EU on the basis that, if the US changes its position, and I do not know whether that will happen, we have to throw out the basis on which we proceed. The logic of the <Col N="93" /> EU position is clear. Some might ask if we can be more creative and dynamic. I have no problem trying to develop that strategy on the basis of the bilateral relations between member states and Cuba. The US holds a different position. From our point of view, I do not see the logic or principle behind the argument that we should forget the basis on which we are trying to develop and enhance these partnership arrangements because the US changes its position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat as deis a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a ardú ag an am seo sa Dáil. Ba mhaith liom i dtosach báire eolas a thabhairt don Dáil i dtaobh Ghaelscoil Bharra, bunscoil lán-Ghaeilge i gCabrach i lár Bhaile Átha Cliath agus i lár mo dháilcheantair féin. Is ceantar lucht oibre é Cabrach agus caithfidh mé a rá, cé go raibh mé ag múineadh i scoil lán-Ghaeilge sular toghadh don Dáil mé, go gcuireann sé íontas orm an dul chun cinn thar barr atá bainte amach ag an ngaelscoil seo. Thosaigh an scoil seo le 26 dalta i prefab beag ar an láthair chéanna sé bliana ó shin, sé sin i 1996. Dhá bhliain in a dhiaidh sin, i 1998, fuair an scoil aitheantas oifigiúil agus anois, don séú bhliain ag an scoil ag feidhmiú, tá thart ar 200 dalta ag freastal ann. Sé sin, 171 dalta sa ghaelscoil féin agus thart ar 30 sa naíonra atá in éineacht leis ach atá neamhspleách <Col N="94" /> ar an scoil. Rud eile a chuireann íontas orm, agus caithfidh mé é seo a admháil, ná go dtagann 80 faoin gcéad de na páistí sin ó Chabrach. Tagann an cuid eile acu ó Bhaile Phib ó Bhóthar na hUaimhe agus ó Stoneybatter, seancheantar traidisiúnta sa chathair.</P>
      <P>Tá cúig prefabs ag an scoil ag an bpointe seo, cuid acu atá go dona, ag ligint báistí isteach chomh maith le fadhbanna eile. Níl ach dhá leithreas as deich gcinn ag obair i gceart. Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal tá áiseanna íontacha ar an láthair chéanna a bhaineann an scoil úsáid astu. Tá halla gym ann; páirc oscailte traenála agus carr pháirc. Baineann na háiseanna sin go léir le Club Peile Naomh Fionnbarra ach tugann an club cead don scoil úsáid a bhaint astu. Mar sin, is láthair íontach le haghaidh bunscoil an láthair seo. Ach tá rud amháin atá riachtanach dóibh chun cur leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta acu, agus is é sin ná foirgneamh nua-aimsireach buan. Tá sé sin ag teastáil thar aon ní eile.</P>
      <P>Tá na pleananna ullamh acu, bunaithe ar scoil Raghnallach atá tógtha ar láthair atá an-chosúil leis an phíosa talún atá ag Gaelscoil Bharra. Ins na pleananna sin tá ocht seomra ranga, leabharlann, seomra ríomhaireachta, seomra feabhais agus clós.  Bheadh naíonra i gceist freisin, seomra phobail agus halla le haghaidh drámaíochta. Tá na pleananna sin leagtha síos acu go hiomlán de réir rialacha na Roinne. Níor chóir go mbeadh deacracht ar bith ag baint leo. Scríobh an scoil go dtí an Roinn Oideachais i mí Lúnasa na bliana seo caite agus bhí orthu scríobh arís i mí Eanáir na bliana seo ag lorg cruinniú ar a laghad i dtaobh na ceiste seo, foirgneamh nua a thógáil.</P>
      <P>De réir mar a chloisim, níl oifigigh na Roinne Oideachais sásta fiú teacht amach agus buaileadh le húdarás na scoile. Tá sé sin do-chreidte domsa. Ní thuigimse é sin ó Rialtas a thugann tacaíocht don Ghaeilge. Cuirfidh mé mar seo é; tá réabhlóid chultúrtha ar siúl sa cheantar lucht oibre seo i gCabrach i lár Bhaile Átha Cliath leis an obair íontach atá á dhéanamh ag an bpobal sa cheantar sin &ndash; an ghaelscoil, an naíonra, Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, Glór na nGael, feachtas frith-dhrugaí, ranganna Gaeilge, ciorcal chomhrá, ranganna ceoil agus go leor eile agus nuair a chuireann siad iarratas isteach go dtí an Roinn Oideachais ag lorg cabhrach níl an Roinn sásta buaileadh leo fiú amháin. Tá sé sin scannalach agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire deimhin de nach leanfaidh an scéal mar sin agus ar a laghad go mbeidh an Roinn sásta oifigeach a chur amach go dtí an scoil.</P>
      <P>Tá sé scannalach muna bhfuil tacaíocht iomlán acu ón Roinn Oideachais agus muna bhfuil an Roinn sásta buaileadh leo chun na pleananna atá acu a thabhairt chun cinn. Tá súil agam go mbeidh freagra agam ón Aire anois agus go bhféachfaidh sé chuige go mbualfaidh an Roinn leis an scoil agus go dtabharfaidh siad an chabhair dóibh atá á lorg acu chun foirgneamh buan a thógaint.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta as an deis a thabhairt dom a insint don <Col N="95" /> Teach an tslí a bhfuil cúrsaí faoi láthair maidir le soláthar fhoirgneamh buan do Ghaelscoil Bharra. Bunaíodh an scoil i 1996 agus tá sí i gcóiríocht shealadach faoi láthair ar thailte Chumann Luthchleas Gael Naomh Fionnbarra. Ba é an líon a bhí ar an rolla ag Gaelscoil Bharra ag deireadh Mheán Fómhair 2001 ná 166 dalta agus an fhoireann atá faoi láthair inti ná Príomhoide agus sé chuntóir.</P>
      <P>Tá a fhios ag an Teachta an deacracht a bhaineann le suíomh a fháil sa cheantar sin. Nuair a bheidh suíomh buan oiriúnach faighte don Ghaelscoil, áfach, rachfar ar aghaidh le tionscadal tógála molta chuig pleanáil ailtireachta agus chuig ullmhú cáipéisí tairisceana chomh luath agus is féidir faoin gclár tógála leathnaithe. Faoi láthair tá breis is 450 tionscadal bunscoile ag mo Roinn ag céim phleanáil ailtireachta. Is í an leithroinnt d'fhoirgnimh bhunscoile in 2002 ná &euro;153.6 milliún, an leibhéal is airde maoinithe fós agus léiríonn sé tiomantas an Rialtais seo maidir le cúrsaí cóiríochta i mbunscoileanna a fheabhsú. Sin beagnach ceithre oiread infheistíocht an Rialtais roimhe seo i 1997.</P>
      <P>De bharr an mhéadaithe mhóir ar ghníomhaíocht i réímsí foirgneamh bunscoileanna ó tháinig an Rialtas seo in oifig tá ardú mór ar an líon tionscadal beag agus mór tógála a bhfuiltear ag dul dóibh agus tá an leibhéal tógála agus gníomhaíocht athchóirithe dá bharr seo níos airde ná riamh. Tá mo Roinnse tiomanta go hiomlán ar chóiríocht níos fearr a sholáthar do Ghaelscoil Bharra agus gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta arís as an deis a thabhairt dom cúrsaí mar atá a léiriú don Teach.</P>
      <P>Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte go ndéanfaidh an Rialtas a lán-dhícheall, nuair a bheidh suíomh buan bainte amach, foirgneamh nua a thógaint don scoil chomh luath agus is féidir. Más féidir leis an Teachta cabhrú leis an Roinn suíomh sásúil a fháil ní bheidh aon mhoill ar an Rialtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to raise this matter in the national Parliament, but it is of great importance to my constituency. There has been some confusion and foot-dragging in the matter of the approval of the long-delayed sewerage scheme for the village of Ballyroan. This was first mooted over 27 years ago, and it is now the spring of 2002 and work has not yet commenced. This is a source of serious concern, not only in the village of Ballyroan but also in surrounding areas. Over recent years we have seen considerable improve<Col N="96" /> ments in infrastructural developments throughout many rural towns and villages in County Laois and it is most regrettable that this matter has yet to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Ballyroan is a village that wishes to participate, as other villages do, in urban renewal and in attracting private investment, including, possibly, in public housing schemes. This cannot be done until the village has sufficient infrastructural sewerage facilities. Until these works are completed, Ballyroan as a village will simply not grow. Laois County Council has adopted a policy which is no different from that of other counties. It has a difficulty with once-off urban housing in rural areas. Until the Government provides sufficient funding for rural villages to update water and sewerage works we will be consigning young rural people, particularly those who are settling down to start a life of their own, to the larger provincial towns. This will be the case unless we are prepared to fund schemes such as the one which is on the table for Ballyroan.</P>
      <P>Earlier last year, certain works had been set in place, but they did not reach the required standard to garner approval from the Minister of the Environment and Local Government. Extra funding was then sought. There has been much toing and froing between Laois County Council and the Department in recent weeks to facilitate the final approval of this important measure. I would like the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, to give that final confirmation or approval now. My understanding from the local authority is that everything required of it has been set in place. Appropriate orders have been signed and sealed. It was widely anticipated that these works would commence in January, but we are now into February and that has not happened. I hope that the Minister of State will remove any doubt and give the go-ahead so that Laois County Council can employ the contractors on site that will allow for this long-awaited development to take place in the village of Ballyroan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for allowing me to join him on this motion. We all agree that Ballyroan needs this sewerage scheme and that it is long overdue. Sanction was given by the Minister in May 1999 and several years on we still have not seen any work on the ground. I understand the council has submitted much documentation on improvements to the scheme that was originally proposed. In recent days final information has been sent from Laois County Council to the Department. I hope there are no further outstanding queries at this stage and I urge the Minister to ensure the documentation that has been received in the Department from the local authority this week will be examined as a matter of top priority with a view to ensuring that approval is given to Laois County Council to commence the works at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The unprecedented increase in investment by the Department of the Environment and Local Government during that period on water and sewerage schemes has made a key contribution to the remarkable economic growth that has benefited every part of Ireland. Total investment in water and sewerage facilities over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will amount to almost &euro;4.4 billion, of which more than &euro;3.8 billion is earmarked for major public schemes.</P>

      <P>The additional water production capacity generated by the resulting expansion of the Department's water services investment programme during the first year, 2000, of the NDP alone equated with the average daily requirements of more than 300,000 people.

      <P>The Ballyroan sewerage scheme will provide a new foul sewer network and secondary treatment facilities. The objective is to ensure that any danger of pollution of the local watercourse is eliminated and that any development potential in the area can be realised.</P>
      <P>In June 1999 Laois County Council was advised by my Department that it could proceed immediately to seek tenders for the scheme. As it transpired, the council's tender recommendation was only received in the Department last week. Some of the delay in progressing the scheme to tender stage would have been due to the decision by the local authority to change the scope of the scheme from that originally approved in 1999, including altering the location of the treatment works site. Contrary to local reports, the tender recommendation is not approved and is currently under consideration in the Department. The county council will be informed as soon as a decision is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The match I referred to takes place on Saturday week. It is an important rugby match between England and Ireland. When I was Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, one of the tasks I had as President of the Council of Broadcasting Ministers of the European Union was to renegotiate <i>Télévision Sans Frontières</i>. In the course of that, the principle was established that citizens of the EU had the right, free to air, of certain significant events, which were regarded as part of their heritage, including sporting events.</P>
      <P>I later sought to establish this by bringing in a Private Members' Bill, which would ensure the same kind of rights to Irish citizens as are available today in Denmark, Italy and the UK. The Minister, in the course of broadcasting legislation announced that she accepted this obligation, but the reality is the failure of my successor, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to generate a list of significant sporting events despite the fact that it was required almost five years ago. This means that Irish citizens who are not subscribers to Sky Television will be confined to seeing the score for this match on Irish news programmes. The exclusive rights have been purchased by Mr. Murdoch's Sky Television and they are not available to Irish viewers who are interested in sport. The Department has said it is working on the list. It is a disgrace and an absolute abnegation of responsibility. We are in the midst of an appalling derogation of responsibility in relation to broadcasting. NTL has stopped carrying Eurosport. The whole purpose of the directive which we fought for, namely to retain some semblance of citizens' right to communicate, is being squandered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When researching this matter I found that in the Official Record of debates of 30 March 1999, an item on the Adjournment dealt with the Government's unit which monitors the press. In the course of an appeal to the Information Commissioner, an interesting note arose from the director of the press unit. He had sent the Taoiseach a note with a clipping from the <i>News of the World </i>which said: &ldquo;Taoiseach, our old friends in the <i>News of the World </i>like you. I think I would suggest that you might drop them a note and thank them for their support.&rdquo; This was after the <i>News of the World </i>came out in favour of the Government. However Rupert Murdoch might <Col N="102" /> rank with the Taoiseach and the Government, it is an absolute scandal that no effort has been made to protect the rights of those interested in seeing sport televised in line with the rights that exist in Italy, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Under the directive and the accommodating legislation, they have listed the events they regard as being of national significance but we have not done so and I want to know why. The match on Saturday week is but the beginning. There will be other international events.</P>
    <P>With the decline of the European Broadcasting Union and with other bids in for the World Cup, the next Olympics, etc. this Government and the Minister responsible for broadcasting are accepting a monopoly in broadcasting and are not even exercising the small scope that was there for assuring general access for Irish viewers to events of national significance. It is an absolute scandal. It is a very long journey from Éamon de Valera to Rupert Murdoch. I am sure there are many people who believe in national self respect, identity and the rights of viewers who will be appalled by this first illustration of abdication of responsibility in broaccasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan):</NameTxt>
      <P>Nuair a thosaigh an Teachta shíl mé go raibh sé ag caint faoin chluiche an-tábhachtach idir a chontae agus mo chontae féin. Beidh sé sin beo ar TG4 agus ní bheidh deacracht ar bith é sin a fheiceáil.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and providing the occasion to address the concerns which he has raised. First, I would like to make clear what the Television Without Frontiers Directive does not do. It does not place an obligation on member states to designate any event. In accordance with the directive, it is entirely a matter for the individual member state to decide whether or not to draw up a list of events which it deems to be both of major importance to society and which, in the view of the member state, should be available on free-to-air television services. Neither does the directive seek to influence member states as to what events they might include on a list should the member state decide to have one. I will return to the question of drawing up such a list later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive places an obligation on member states to provide in national legislation the statutory basis for the designation of events as being of major importance to society and which should be available on free-to-air television services. The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, which was passed into law on 13 November 1999, fulfils Ireland's obligation in this regard. Under that legislation, my Department may designate a list of events which should, in the public interest, be available on free-to-air television. In drawing up such a list, the Minister <Col N="103" /> is obliged to act in consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. In addition, the Minister must make reasonable efforts to consult with the organisers of the events and with broadcasters who are under the jurisdiction of the State. Following this, the Minister must engage in a public consultation process. It is only after completing this complex and time-consuming process that the Minister can then bring a draft order designating an event or events before this House. An order approved by the Oireachtas will also require approval at EU level.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation on drawing up a list of events to be designated. A preliminary consultation process was undertaken with the major sporting organisations and that process is ongoing. From the consultation process, it has become evident that the designation of any given event is a complex matter. Some sporting organisations have argued against designation of the major events they organise on the basis that designation could impact negatively on their finances and, consequently, on the future development of the games, particularly at club level. The possible negative impact of designation on the sporting organisations has to be considered, as has the public interest of certain events being available on free-to-air television.</P>
    <P>The issues involved are complex but are being addressed in an appropriate consultative and democratic manner. Further consultations with the sporting organisations and with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will be required over the coming months. Following this, the Department will be in a position to engage in a wider public consultation before bringing the matter before this House. I will, of course, advise the Minister of the Deputy's enthusiasm for having the matter brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Death by Assisted Suicide.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to express my condolences to the family and friends of the unfortunate <Col N="104" /> victim of the recent assisted suicide in Dublin. The fact that an assisted suicide could be planned and carried out in this jurisdiction is of extreme legal, moral and ethical concern. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, but I am disappointed the Minister for Health and Children, to whose area of responsibility this matter relates, is not in a position to be present.</P>
      <P>The issue further casts a severe question mark over the services available in the State for those who suffer mental illness, depression or deep despair and who see no solution to their difficulties other than taking their life. In 1999 and 2000, a total of 828 people were killed on Irish roads. In the same years, official figures show that 852 people died by suicide. It is accepted that the suicide figure is under recorded. In 2001, Exchequer funding for road safety agencies was an inadequate &euro;22.65 million, excluding expenditure by the Garda on enforcement of road traffic law. In the same year, just &euro;1.05 million was allocated for suicide prevention. The State's investment and consequent interest in suicide prevention must be seriously questioned. This tragic issue which causes such trauma and devastation for families and communities must have a higher priority for Government and its agencies. Services must be made available, visible and easily accessible for all who are in crisis. The unfortunate victim of the recent event in Dublin suffered deep depression and had undergone numerous courses of treatment. She was once hospitalised for six months after an attempted suicide.</P>
      <P>Research shows that those who have a history of self-harm are a high risk group and are between ten and 30 times more at risk of suicide than the general population. The services should have identified her as having a high risk of suicide and made the necessary services available on a continuous basis to enable her to lead as full and enjoyable a life as possible.</P>
      <P>The research also highlights our appalling suicide prevention policies. There is an urgent need to debate the issue of assisted suicide and euthanasia. The debate in Britain which resulted from the decision of a British woman totally paralysed by a degenerative nervous disease to bring a case to the High Court to win her right to die presents legal and ethical problems which will be faced by this State in the very near future. It poses the question: does a person who believes that his or her quality of life has deteriorated so badly have a right to decide to die? The case also presents a further question: should a person requested for help be exempt from criminal prosecution if help is given to a person to take his or her own life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years international opinion regarding euthanasia in cases of serious physical illness has become more liberal. Suicide was decriminalised in Ireland in 1993, the last country in western <Col N="105" /> Europe to do so. The Act of the Oireachtas introduced at the time expressly criminalised aiding and abetting, counselling and procuring the suicide of another. A person found guilty of such an offence is liable to imprisonment for a term of up to 14 years. This clearly outlines the current legal situation. Pressure will come on how to reinterpet or even change this.</P>
    <P>Apart from serious moral and ethical principles involved, there are serious societal reasons for disallowing euthanasia. The main reason is the fear of developing the slippery slope whereby if euthanasia becomes acceptable under any circumstances, the boundaries of what is considered lawful killing would be stretched even wider. This has happened elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands, assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed under certain circumstances. A case brought before the courts in 2000 clarified several issues regarding assisted suicide. It confirmed that suffering need not be physical and that a person may not be terminally ill for euthanasia to be permissible.</P>
    <P>We must guard against such a situation developing here. There is a blurring between voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. Again, there is evidence that there are cases of ending the life of patients with a mental handicap and dementia. The slippery slope is on the way to involuntary euthanasia for social reasons. Is it possible that the elderly, especially those who are elderly and rich, will become dispensable? The acid test for our society is how it protects the life and promotes the well being of its most vulnerable citizens, the very young, the very old, the chronically ill and those with severe disability. We, as a nation, must never in any way compromise this.</P>
    <P>I have been asked questions on the merit of ending somebody's life who is severely physically and mentally ill and in severe pain with no prospect of a cure. I have close contact with the hospice movement here and immediate and personal knowledge of the services provided by Milford Care Centre. The hospice movement enables people, regardless of their illness, to live life to the end, to live it with dignity, to die with dignity and with efficient pain control. The debate must surround how we cater for and invest in facilities to ensure those who are terminally ill at the end of their days have as good a quality of life and pain control as possible and as a means of doing this we must invest heavily in the hospice movement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, I thank the Deputy for providing me with an opportunity to address this sensitive matter. On my own behalf and on behalf of the Minister I extend sincerest sympathies and condolences to the family of the deceased person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would like to remind the House, <Col N="106" /> however, that it is not his practice to comment upon ongoing Garda investigations. The events referred to by the Deputy are very recent and the House will appreciate that it would neither be appropriate nor helpful for the Minister to go into very specific detail or speculate as to the circumstances behind them. Obviously, it is of paramount importance that nothing is said or done which could interfere with or prejudice the outcome of a Garda investigation into any alleged crime which may have taken place in this instance or any likely future prosecutions which may result arising from the investigation.</P>
    <P>Mindful of the above, the Minister can, however, inform the House of the following on the basis of communications received from the Garda authorities. The Minister understands that on 26 February 2002 the body of a woman who had been suffering from depression was found in a house in Donnybrook. She died from gas poisoning. Garda investigations so far indicate that the deceased may have sought assistance in arranging her death and an investigation to establish the full circumstances surrounding her death, which involves making inquiries inside and outside the jurisdiction, is under way.</P>
    <P>It may, at this point, be worthwhile to briefly set out the legislation in relation to the issue at hand. The Criminal Law (Suicide) Act, 1993, decriminalised suicide. However, the Act also provides that a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide or attempted suicide of another shall be guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a term of up to 14 years imprisonment. Proceedings may only be instituted with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister would also like to deal with the manner in which the media report suicide. This story is clearly of legitimate public interest and it must be acknowledged that, on the whole, the media have shown considerable judgment and restraint. Nevertheless, the danger of so-called copycat suicides is a real issue, one with which the media and educators generally have to be extremely careful. We also have to be very aware of the feelings of the bereaved. The Minister, therefore, endorses the views expressed in the booklet, Media Guidelines on the Portrayal of Suicide, jointly published by the Samaritans and the Irish Association of Suicidology in January 2000. Media coverage of suicidal behaviour should project an objective, yet preventive message as well as educate and inform the public about the subject. It is believed that by providing the public with information about the warning signs of suicide, how to help, who to call, and where to get help, the media could help prevent potential suicides by providing a positive and preventive message to balance the story.</P>
    <P>The national task force on suicide, in its report published in 1998, put forward a national suicide <Col N="107" /> prevention-reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities. The Minister is informed that all recommendations, in so far as they relate to the Garda Siochána, have been implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> The Minister would like to assure the House that the Garda Síochána will continue to pursue its investigations until such time as the matter is resolved, in whatever manner that may be.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 February 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the mandate given by UN Security Council Resolution 1359, the personal envoy of the UN Secretary General, Mr. James Baker, is pursuing two tracks. One of them is the UN settlement plan, which provides for the holding of a referendum to determine the future status of Western Sahara. This plan has been stalemated for a number of years. The other track is the framework agreement, which provides for a measure of autonomy now, followed by a referendum in five years time.</P>
      <P>From the Secretary General's interim report to the Security Council of 10 January, it would appear that little progress has been made on the framework agreement proposals put forward by Mr. Baker in June. These have been rejected as a basis for negotiations by the POLISARIO and by the Government of Algeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Baker is to report to the Secretary General later this month on the outcome of his current efforts to find agreement among the parties on possible additional proposals which could be a <Col N="110" /> basis for negotiations and break the impasse on the implementation of the UN settlement plan.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a long-standing supporter of the right of the Saharawi people to self-determination. The Government continues to consider the UN settlement plan as a reasonable basis for a just political solution to the conflict in Western Sahara. We believe that political negotiations on possible alternative proposals for political solution must have the consent of all parties to the conflict.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to have had the opportunity to discuss the issue with Foreign Minister Benaissa of Morocco when he visited Dublin last week. Ireland, as a member of the UN Security Council, welcomes the efforts of Mr. Baker to find a means of reaching an agreed solution and we have encouraged all the parties to work with him over the short period remaining to the renewal of the MINURSO mandate by the Security Council at the end of this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has been a member of the Security Council for just over a year. Our membership of the council has provided us with an opportunity to promote Ireland's broad foreign policy interests, values and objectives. I believe that we have managed to do that and at the same time to make a very constructive contribution to the work of the council.</P>
      <P>We have sought at all times to stress the need to address the root causes of conflict, to respect principles of international law, to promote fundamental human rights, with particular emphasis on the status of women and children, and to eradicate poverty. When dealing with conflict situations, we have consistently stressed the need to focus on the humanitarian situation of those affected.</P>
      <P>As members of the Security Council, we have been obliged to address conflict situations across the globe &ndash; Afghanistan, the Congo, Palestine and many others. We have sought to address every issue which has arisen objectively, on its merits, consistent with our values. We have not engaged in high rhetoric, we have resisted the temptation to climb on the soap-box and sound off. Rather we have worked painstakingly, with our partners on the council, with other member states and with UN officials and NGOs to persuade and encourage those involved in conflict and other members of the council to follow what we believe to be the right course towards compromise and resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> It is not easy for a small, non-permanent member of the council to take a leading role on the council. Certainly, we have not achieved all that we would like. I refer in particular, to the situation in the Middle East. Nevertheless, I believe that we have established a significant standing and influence on the council. As a result, our contribution to conflict resolution, peacekeeping, peace-building, the promotion of human rights and addressing the humanitarian needs of populations in crisis has been of the highest order.</P>
    <P>Those members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs who travelled to New York last October, during our presidency of the council, know and value this. The quality of our efforts has also been generously recognised by many who are in a position to closely follow the workings of the council.</P>
    <P>I regret that what the Deputy describes as the &ldquo;criticism&rdquo; of the Government's performance on the Security Council is essentially founded on a contention that the US acted illegally under international law in seeking to defend itself against the attacks of 11 September.</P>
    <P>We have debated this issue on several occasions in this House. I know that there are differing and perhaps even irreconcilable views on the matter. For my part, I believe that the Government was right to agree with the UN Secretary General who made clear to the members of the Oireachtas joint committee his view that the US had the right, recognised under Article 51 of the UN Charter, to act in self-defence. I also still believe that the Government was right, acting in conformity with Security Council Resolution 1368, to offer assistance in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the 11 September attacks and those who aided and abetted them. The number of al-Qaeda fighters found to be present in Afghanistan exceeded the worst fears of the international community and demonstrated that Afghanistan under the Taliban had become a terrorist training camp.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the arguments made by the person in question have been presented as a general criticism of our performance on the Security Council. This is both inaccurate and unwarranted.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to criticism by Amnesty International, I have to inform the Deputy that both Ms Irene Khan, the Secretary General of Amnesty International, and Mr. Seán Love, director of the Irish section, made clear to officials of my Department that the press article and the headline to which I assume the Deputy refers did not represent their views or those of Amnesty International. In fact, I have before me a letter from Mr. Love to an official in my Department, dated 29 January 2002, in which he states the following:</P>
    <P>During its chairmanship of the UN Security Council and indeed in negotiations at this current session of the General Assembly, the Irish Government have been strong in their support <Col N="112" /> of bringing UN texts and resolutions into conformity with international humanitarian and human rights law.</P>

Clearly, the conditions at the prison, as described in the report, are below international standards.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the status of the prison and the prisoners held there remains to be determined. I welcome the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross has access to the prison and continues to investigate the status of the prisoners there.</P>
      <P>I call on the prison's authorities, and the Afghan Interim Administration, to implement the recommendations of both the ICRC and the Physicians for Human Rights group in relation to the conditions at the prison. I recall the terms of the Bonn Agreement, which states that the Interim Authority shall act in accordance with basic principles and provisions contained in international instruments on human rights and international humanitarian law to which Afghanistan is a party.</P>
      <P>The international community is committed to assisting the Interim Authority in addressing the massive challenges it faces in rebuilding the country, including in relation to prison conditions.</P>
      <P>I recently attended the Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan Reconstruction where international donors pledged US$4 billion for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, US$1.8 billion of it to be made available during 2002. The EU has contributed US$550 million of this 2002 allocation.</P>
      <P>For our part, the Government has pledged &euro;12 million to Afghanistan reconstruction over the next three years. A team of Irish officials is currently undertaking a needs assessment mission to the region.</P>
      <P>At the conference, I met with the chairman of the Interim Administration, Hamid Karzai, his Foreign Minister, Abdullah Abdullah and other members of the Administration. I took that opportunity to underline Ireland's position that all detained persons are entitled to the protection of international humanitarian instruments and international humanitarian law.</P>

      <P>On 6 November, David Trimble and Mark Durkan were successfully elected First and Deputy First Minister respectively by the Assembly in Northern Ireland. As I said in my reply to the earlier priority question, the period since has been a highly productive one in all the institutions created under the Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Assembly has been advancing its work, including reaching cross-community agreement on its budget for the period 2002-2003 in December. The Executive has also been operating successfully. I welcomed the appointments of Seán Farren as Minister for Finance and Personnel and Carmel Hanna as Minister for Employment and Learning in December, and wished them, and their colleagues, continuing success in their work. It was also encouraging to note the recent successful visits of the First and Deputy First Minister to Europe and the United States, including the formal opening of the offices of the Northern Executive in Brussels and Washington.</P>
      <P>I have long been of the view that if we are to succeed in advancing matters across the range of issues, a sustained period of political calm, in which the institutions work on a full and inclusive basis, was necessary. I believe that this is now possible.</P>

      <P>The focus of my first official visit to the People's Republic of China on 22 to 25 January was on strengthening our bilateral relations, in keeping with the Asia strategy, launched after the visit by the Taoiseach to China in September 1998.</P>
      <P>I met with senior Chinese leaders, including Premier of the State Council, Zhu Rongji, and Foreign Minister, Tang Jiaxuan. I conducted a meeting with the heads of Irish diplomatic missions resident in Asia and with the representatives of the semi-State agencies and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. These were the first such joint meetings and we focused on evaluating the implementation of the Government's Asia strategy and on making recommendations for strengthening and improving the effectiveness of the Government's promotional efforts in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My meeting with Premier Zhu and Foreign Minister Tang focused on international and regional political issues, our shared membership <Col N="114" /> of the UN Security Council, human rights and issues of bilateral economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>I had a very productive discussion with Foreign Minister Tang on the issue of human rights. I raised a number of areas of concern in relation to human rights with him, in an open and frank way, and Minister Tang responded in kind.</P>
    <P>I emphasised the importance which the Government attaches to the respect of human rights. I highlighted, in particular, the level of concern in Ireland in relation to Tibet. I strongly encouraged the Chinese authorities to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama on the issues of concern.</P>
    <P>I also raised the case of Trinity student, Mr. Zhao Ming, which the Taoiseach had previously raised in his meeting with Premier Zhu in September of last year. I was informed that Mr. Zhao would be released on 12 March and that he would, at that stage, be eligible to apply for an exit visa. I was assured that there was no physical ill-treatment of him during his period of detention and that he received regular medical check-ups.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussion with Minister Tang, I also highlighted the positive elements of our relationship with China in the human rights area. I noted, for example, that the Centre for Human Rights in Galway will be working in partnership with the Law Institute in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences over the next two years in the EU-China human rights network.</P>
    <P>I also took note of encouraging developments in relation to human rights within China, such as the renewal of the UN's programme of technical assistance to China in the field of human rights.</P>
    <P>Overall, my trip was a highly successful one which, I feel, contributed to raising Ireland's profile in the region and I look forward to further deepening Ireland's relations with Asia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>A key area for involvement by Ireland Aid, the Government's programme of assistance to poorer countries, is the provision of drinkable and accessible water. It is central to the provision of good health, especially among children. The absence of accessible and potable water has a huge and disproportionately negative effect on the lives of women, who, in the main, are responsible for walking the often very long distances to procure the water available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish bilateral programme has a particular geographic focus in eastern and southern Africa on six of the poorest countries of the world. All of them rate low on the United Nations development programmes' poverty index, the human <Col N="115" /> development index. They are Ethiopia, which is listed as 158th out of 162, and Mozambique, which is number 157th. The list also includes poor countries like Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania and Lesotho.</P>
    <P>Some consideration is being given to the possibility of increasing the number of country programmes. It is likely, however, that least developed poor countries adjacent to the current six will be looked at first. Notwithstanding the primary focus of the bilateral programme on these six countries, Ireland provides assistance to the work of NGOs and missionaries in a wide range of countries, including Ghana, in their work of improving the position of the poor, often in the provision of clean water, through its NGO co-financing programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to Ghana, the Deputy may wish to be aware that Ireland Aid is currently examining an NGO co-financing proposal to address the water and sanitation needs of a number of communities in the western region of Ghana. The aim of the proposal is to reduce the incidence of illnesses and associated morbidity and mortality by using an integrated approach to sanitation, hygiene education and safe water provision.</P>
    <P>This proposal, which deals in a comprehensive way with a very basic human need which is well recognised by Ireland Aid, has now received a positive initial appraisal and hence will be considered at the next meeting of the Ireland Aid NGO co-financing committee, which makes recommendations for ministerial decision.</P>

      <P>I have noted the concerns of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in relation to the Australian Government's policy of detaining asylum seekers and more especially in relation to prolonged detentions and the detention of minors. I am conscious that the policy guidelines of the UNHCR's executive committee, of which Australia is a member, state that the detention of asylum seekers, especially children, is inherently undesirable. I call upon the Government of Australia to act upon the recommendations of the UNHCR.</P>

      <P>The Government very much hopes that there will be no extension of military action beyond that undertaken in Afghanistan. We will make every effort to ensure that any further effort to eradicate international terrorism is achieved through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Security Council Resolution 1368, which is binding on all members of the United Nations, calls on all states to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of the terrorist attacks of 11 September and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of those acts will be held accountable.</P>
      <P>If evidence was forthcoming that, in addition to the Taliban, the governments of one or more states were involved in harbouring those involved in the atrocities of 11 September, then those governments would also be held accountable under the terms of Resolution 1368. If this were to occur, the Government would wish the matter resolved without resort to military action. It is the Government's firm position that military action should be undertaken only as a means of last resort after all other means have failed.</P>
      <P>It is critical that, at the same time as tackling international terrorism, the international community gives urgent priority to addressing the many root causes of conflict and terrorism. These include poverty, injustice, abuses of human rights and the proliferation of small arms. Ireland will continue to work to this end. All states have the inherent right to self-defence, recognised under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Ireland expects a state which acts under the right to self-defence to fulfil its obligations under the charter.</P>

The terms of employment, including leave, of all locally employed staff are set in accordance with local practice and the employment laws and regulations of the host state, rather than Irish legislation. In this regard, salary scales are maintained in line with those offered by the local embassies as well as similar local public and private sector employment. They are adjusted on a regular basis to take account of local inflation.</P>
      <P>As an equal opportunity employer, the Department does not use nationality as a recruitment criterion. Accordingly, no records in regard to the nationality of local staff are kept.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>All the countries of north Africa, with the exception of Libya, are parties to the Barcelona Process which was established at the meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Ministers held on 27 and 28 November 1995. The Barcelona Declaration, which was adopted at the meeting, called for the establishment of a free trade area to be achieved through the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements between the European Union and the respective Mediterranean partners. The declaration set a target date of 2010 for the gradual achievement of the proposed free trade area, which is intended to cover most products. Where agricultural produce is concerned, the Barcelona Declaration called for progressive liberalisation of trade through reciprocal preferential access among the partners.</P>
      <P>All the Euro-Mediterranean agreements provide for greater liberalisation of trade in agricultural produce and there are ongoing discussions between the European Commission and the countries concerned, which deal with all issues arising in the framework of the agreements. As far as trade in agricultural produce with the countries of north Africa is concerned, negotiations with Morocco for a revised protocol on trade in agricultural produce took place on 23 January and are to resume in March. The EU-Tunisia association council met on 29 January to discuss matters of mutual concern including trade.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is not aware of any complaints from north African countries about fruit and vegetable products being imported into the EU and re-labelled and sold as European produce. Both the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the permanent representation in Brussels have contacted the relevant services of the European Commission and been informed that the Commission is not aware of such complaints. The Ministers responsible for trade in the Euro-Mediterranean area will meet in Toledo on 19 March next to review developments in trade over the past year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Support for conflict prevention activities has been a long-standing and key aspect of Irish foreign policy and of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Ireland, along with the other member states, endorsed the EU programme for the prevention of violent conflicts at the Gothenburg European Council in June 2001.</P>
      <P>The programme identifies political priorities for preventive actions and measures to ensure early warning, action and policy coherence, including via the European Security and Defence Policy. A further extensive list of measures to strengthen EU instruments for long-term and short-term prevention is set out and the EU also commits itself to a range of initiatives designed to increase co-operation and build effective partnerships with other international organisations. Chief among these organisations are the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe. NATO and the International Committee of the Red Cross, among other organisations, also feature.</P>
      <P>Since Gothenburg, the General Affairs Council has considered potential conflict issues at the outset of each EU Presidency. Most recently, conclusions adopted by the Council on 28 January 2002 specify that EU preventive policies will take into account the importance of co-operation with other international, regional and local actors, including non-governmental organisations. A first report on implementation of the EU programme is to be submitted by the current Spanish EU Presidency to the European Council in Seville on 21-22 June 2002.</P>
      <P>A common position on conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa was adopted by the General Affairs Council on 14 May 2001 and is of particular importance in this area. The common position was drawn up with the objective of contributing to the prevention, management and resolution of violent conflicts in Africa. This is to be achieved by strengthening African capacity in this field and, in particular, through support for the Organisation of African Unity, various African sub-regional organisations and civil society. The common position is legally binding on all member states and contains a number of undertakings by which EU and member states' policies will be guided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I also draw attention to the numerous commitments made by Ireland and the EU to conflict prevention activities in the context of our respective bilateral and collective development assistance programmes. As I stated at the General Affairs Council debate on this topic on 28 January, development co-operation focused on <Col N="120" /> poverty eradication is one of the most effective instruments by which the long-term root causes of conflict can be addressed. In this context, Ireland and the EU have committed themselves to extensive co-ordination and co-operation arrangements with our partners in the relevant UN agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, which has conflict prevention as part of its mandate.</P>
    <P>As well as our ongoing work with the core UN agencies, Ireland Aid has also supported the conflict prevention efforts of a number of other organisations. These have included the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, UNIDIR, for assistance to address the proliferation of small arms in west Africa, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, UNTAET, for a study on gender in post-conflict situations, support for the facilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue and support for disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation in Sierra Leone. In the past, Ireland Aid has also provided support to the OAU, now African Union, for conflict prevention in Africa.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has taken a strong forward position in the formation of EU policy in relation to the actions of the Government of Zimbabwe which have involved human rights violations and the undermining of democracy in that country. The EU has been engaged in a dialogue with Zimbabwe for ten months in an attempt to encourage the Zimbabwean Government to take steps to remedy its deteriorating internal situation. Consultations were held in Brussels on 11 January with a Zimbabwean delegation which included Foreign Minister Mudenge.</P>
      <P>At those consultations the EU stressed the need for rapid and tangible results in five areas: an end to political violence; an invitation to the EU to support and observe the presidential election on 9-10 March and the need for a free and fair election; concrete action to protect the freedom of the mass media; independence of the judiciary; and an end to the illegal occupation of properties.</P>
      <P>The EU side asked Zimbabwe to immediately take two steps. First, to invite international observers, including from the EU, at least six weeks before the election, and second, to ensure full access to national and international media to cover the election. The Zimbabwean delegation expressed a willingness to go some way towards meeting the EU's concerns, which Minister Mudenge later confirmed in writing. However, serious violations of human rights have continued to occur in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>My EU colleagues and I, therefore, decided at the General Affairs Council on 28 January to close the consultations and implement targeted sanctions against Zimbabwe if the Government of Zimbabwe prevents the deployment of an EU election observation mission starting by 3 February 2002, or if it later prevents the mission from operating effectively; likewise, if the Government of Zimbabwe prevents the international media from having free access to cover the election; there is a serious deterioration in the situation on the ground, in terms of a worsening of the human rights situation or attacks on the opposition; or the election is assessed as not being free and fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An invitation to dispatch observers was received on 5 February. In this invitation, Foreign Minister Mudenge invited the European Union, together with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, to observe the presidential election. The Zimbabwean side has asked if observers <Col N="122" /> from the following countries could be included in the team: Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. There is a clear consensus among EU member states that, as an observer team represents the Union, the composition of the team is a matter for the EU to determine and the team will be put together on this basis.</P>
    <P>A core team of observers will be dispatched in the coming days to make preparations for the deployment of a full observer mission. While we have a strong interest in ensuring that the presidential election campaign and the election are independently observed, we will also insist that the observer team be permitted to conduct its mission without hindrance. Clearly, the EU will highlight any irregularities it observes either before or during the presidential election.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department will provide all possible consular protection to Irish citizens in Zimbabwe. The Irish embassy in South Africa, which is accredited to Zimbabwe, is monitoring the situation closely and maintains contact with Irish citizens there. Officials from the embassy have travelled to Zimbabwe on a number of occasions to meet with Irish citizens and will continue to do so in the lead up to and during the presidential election. The embassy in Pretoria is also in regular contact with EU embassies in Pretoria and Harare to exchange information on the evolving situation. On the question of the property of Irish citizens in Zimbabwe, Ireland and the EU have consistently called on the Government of Zimbabwe to put an end to illegal occupations of property and ensure that the land reform programme is carried out in accordance with the rule of law.</P>

      <Quest>if he has raised with the British authorities the concerns expressed by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala O'Loan, regarding the conduct of the investigation into the Omagh bombing; the response he has received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>On Saturday, 15 August 1998, a bomb exploded in Omagh killing 29 people and two unborn children. The reports by the Police Ombudsman and the Chief Constable into the investigation of that atrocity have generated considerable public discussion. As the Ombudsman herself has stated, we must not lose sight of the fact that the persons responsible for the tragic loss of so many lives in Omagh that day were those who planned and executed the atrocity. To date, one person has been found guilty of offences related to this bombing. However long it takes us, the other perpetrators of this evil deed must be found and held fully to account before the law.</P>
      <P>On 12 December 2001, the Police Ombudsman issued a report which raised issues of very serious concern about the conduct of the police investigation into the Omagh bombing. The Chief Constable issued a detailed response on 23 January last. Both have presented their respective views to the Omagh families.</P>
      <P>It is now a matter for the Policing Board to assess these reports and take this issue forward. Members of the board met with the Omagh families on 27 January and the board had separate meetings with the Ombudsman and the Chief Constable on Tuesday last, 5 February. That meeting was adjourned at a late hour and the board is meeting again today to continue its consideration of the issues arising from the two reports.</P>
      <P>Since its inception last November, the members of the Policing Board have worked well together and they have endeavoured to deal with difficult issues in a sensitive and constructive manner. The Office of the Ombudsman, the Policing Board and the new police service are all key elements in the new policing arrangements for Northern Ireland. It is important that this matter now be taken forward in a manner which inspires confidence in the new policing order and reassures the relatives that those responsible for the Omagh bomb will be brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main recommendations of the Ombudsman's report was that an investigation team led by a new senior investigating officer, independent of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, be asked to conduct the Omagh bomb investigation. In his report, the Chief Constable opted instead to bring in an officer from an outside police force to act as an advisor to the senior investigating officer. We see merit in the recommendation to bring in an outside officer to conduct the investigation, particularly in circumstances where the confidence of the families in the police investigation is in question. This was done previously by the Chief Constable, for example, in the case of Rosemary Nelson. The Policing Board must now examine all aspects of <Col N="124" /> the current situation, including the six recommendations made by the Ombudsman, and decide on the most effective way to take the police investigation forward.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions about the issues raised by the two reports with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid. The Government's views have also been made known to the British authorities at official level on an ongoing basis. I intend to review the situation with Dr. Reid when we know the outcome of the Policing Board's consideration of the issue.  </P>

      <P>The members of the task force on policy regarding emigrants are Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon, chairman; Mr. David Begg, general secretary, ICTU; Rev. Paul Byrne, OMI, Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants; Mr. Joe Harrington, Department of the Environment and Local Government; Mr. Mahon Hayes, former legal adviser, Department of Foreign Affairs and former permanent representative to the United Nations, New York and Geneva; Professor Mary Hickman, Irish Studies Centre, University of North London &ndash; Alternate: Mr. Sean Hutton, co-ordinator of the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain; Ms Maire McCluskey, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and chairperson, Díon Committee, Irish Embassy London; Mr. Joe McDonagh, former Uachtarán, Cumann Lúthchleas Gael; Mr. Gerry Mangan, Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs; and Monsignor James Murray, Project Irish Outreach, New York &ndash; Alternate: Mr. Adrian Flannelly, Emerald Isle Immigration Centre, New York.</P>
      <P>The task force held its first meeting on 12 December 2001 and has held three further meetings since then on 8 January, 22 January and 5 February.</P>
      <P>In its discussions so far, the task force has organised its work programme and commenced substantive discussion of the issues encompassed by its terms of reference. The task force is asked to recommend a coherent, long-term policy approach to meeting the needs of emigrants, focusing in particular on the needs of young and vulnerable people, in the three areas of pre-departure services for emigrants before they leave Ireland; services to emigrants while they are abroad; and services to returning emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force has also launched a public consultation process to elicit the views of interested organisations and individuals at home and abroad. The aim is to ensure that the task force is fully informed on all aspects of its remit and that anyone who wishes to contribute to its delib<Col N="125" /> erations has an opportunity to do so. As part of the consultation process, members of the task force will be travelling to the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to meet with representatives of organisations providing services to Irish emigrants in those countries.</P>
    <P>The task force has made a very good start to its work and is on course to complete its report by the middle of this year as the terms of reference request. I have asked that the report should contain a series of pragmatic recommendations which will help to improve the services provided to emigrants by official and voluntary organisations in a practical way, so that those who choose to emigrate can make their decision on an informed and considered basis and that they will have access to a wide range of support services while they are abroad and should they wish to return home.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my appreciation to the members of the task force for the energy and commitment they have brought to their work. The establishment of the task force, and the report it produces, will send a strong signal that the welfare and concerns of our citizens abroad are being addressed in a constructive and forward-looking manner.</P>

      <Quest>the representations he has made to the British authorities regarding continued sectarian violence in the north Belfast area; the response he has received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the high levels of sectarian violence in north Belfast. Much of it has been associated with the protest along the route to Holy Cross girls' primary school in Ardoyne, which started in late June 2001, resumed the following September and continued for a further 12 weeks, with appalling sectarian abuse and physical intimidation being directed at the school children and their parents throughout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Wednesday, 9 January last, rioting broke out near the school and the disturbances quickly spread to other surrounding areas. On 12 January, a young postal worker, Daniel McColgan, was brutally murdered on his way to work in Rathcoole. The paramilitaries responsible for this killing subsequently issued death threats against other Catholic postal workers and teachers. While these threats have since been rescinded, the fact remains that the threats represented a direct and unacceptable assault on workers and on the wider community. The paramilitaries responsible for the murder of Mr. McColgan and for the death threats against his colleagues and other workers were rightly rejected by the people who turned out in large numbers at a number of anti-sectarianism rallies on 18 January. The trade <Col N="126" /> union movement is to be commended for organising these rallies.</P>
    <P>Against the background of a very limited number of arrests and prosecutions, the Taoiseach recently called for tougher action to be taken against those loyalist paramilitaries responsible for attacks in north Belfast and elsewhere. I have also raised this matter personally with Dr. Reid. I made it clear that the community needs and deserves the assurance of effective action against both the organisers and the perpetrators of the awful sectarian violence we have witnessed over the past year. As the Secretary of State has publicly indicated, &ldquo;everything possible will be done to ensure convictions are procured&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have asked my officials, who have been in sustained contact with political and community leaders in north Belfast, to continue to monitor the situation there closely. My officials have also raised the issue of loyalist paramilitary violence in the north Belfast area with the British authorities on an ongoing basis through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>Since his appointment by President Bush as Ambassador-at-large with overall responsibility for Ireland last year, Ambassador Haass and I have met on a number of occasions, including in the United States. The Ambassador's most recent visit to Ireland was on 15 January. We had a wide-ranging discussion on international issues of mutual interest. In particular, I took the opportunity to express the Government's appreciation for the ongoing support of President Bush and the US Administration for the peace process and to brief Ambassador Haass on recent developments, including the Government's concern about the deteriorating security situation in north Belfast and the progress made in implementing the Patten recommendations on policing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> On 16 January, Ambassador Haass also met with the Policing Board and afterwards expressed the hope that Sinn Féin would reconsider its position and appoint members to the board. This is also the firm view of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that, following the progress made at Weston Park on policing and the publication of the revised implementation plan, the basis now exists for realising the new beginning to policing envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. The decision of the SDLP to support these arrangements and nominate members to the Policing Board was a significant and very positive development. The Government also welcomed the decisions of the two main Unionist parties to nominate members to the board. Everyone should now give their support to the new policing arrangements and to the new police service. We hope that, in time, Sinn Féin will find it possible to participate in the new policing structures.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the World Archaeological Congress and others in relation to the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the River Tigris in south east Turkey. These concerns relate to the effects which construction of the dam may have on the local population; its impact on cultural heritage in the area, particularly the great archaeological sites of Hasankeyf; and the reported lack of adequate consultation with the affected communities on resettlement issues and on local claims to cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>On 11 December 2001, the Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe approved an information report on the cultural aspects of the Ilisu Dam project. The report was prepared by the committee's general rapporteur on cultural heritage, Mrs. Vlasta Stepová. I presume it is to this report that the Deputy refers in his question. It is to be hoped that the Turkish authorities will carefully bear in mind the legitimate concerns which have been expressed in relation to the project. In this context, the information report prepared by the committee represents an important contribution to discussion. As the Deputy is aware, however, its conclusions are not shared by all those with an interest in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Non-governmental organisations, NGOs, engaged in development co-operation activities with people in the developing world receive very significant funding from the Government. The principal source of funding is the Government's official development assistance programme, Ireland Aid, which operates a number of schemes for NGOs, including NGO co-financing, rehabilitation assistance, emergency humanitarian assistance, human rights and democratisation. NGOs received approximately &euro;33 million directly from Ireland Aid in 2001. Funding of approximately &euro;7 million was channelled to NGOs through the Agency for Personal Service Overseas for personnel co-funding and training costs and through the national committee for development education for development education activities. Both APSO and the NCDE are funded directly by Ireland Aid. Therefore, in 2001, a provisional total of approximately &euro;40 million was allocated to NGOs. Final out-turns for 2001 are not yet available, but will be published in Ireland Aid's 2001 annual report, which will be available later this year and placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>A further source of funds for development NGOs during 2001 was tax deductibility allowed by the Revenue Commissioners on contributions made to such organisations. A number of Irish NGOs are also in receipt of substantial funding from multilateral agencies, such as the UN and the EU, to which the Government contributes from its official development assistance budget. The Deputy will be aware from previous replies to parliamentary questions on this topic that all applications for funding from NGOs, including missionary orders, must conform to a detailed set of criteria and guidelines pertaining to the particular sector being funded. Applicants for funding must demonstrate a capacity to carry out the tasks envisaged as well as a clear and coherent strategy to achieve the aims and objectives of the programme or project. The track record of the applicants in terms of planning, management, monitoring and evaluation is an important consideration when examining proposed projects and programmes. Applications must be carefully costed in advance. Successful applicants are subject to formal contractual arrangements which set out the terms, conditions and reporting requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has a separate audit and evaluation unit which is tasked with ensuring the highest standards of evaluation and the adoption of best development practice. Independent consultants and international experts are regularly commissioned to assist in the evaluation process. Each year a number of projects and programmes <Col N="129" /> carried out by NGOs are selected for rigorous evaluation and financial audit by Ireland Aid's evaluation and audit unit. NGOs in receipt of public funds must demonstrate that they have systems in place to monitor and evaluate projects and a demonstrated capacity to address issues such as sustainability, participation, local ownership, gender, environmental impact and cost effectiveness. In addition, the evaluation team reports on whether the projects and programmes are performing to expectations, whether the funds are reaching the beneficiaries and if the projects and programmes funded represent good value for money.</P>
    <P>During 2001 a number of major evaluations were conducted by the Ireland Aid evaluation and audit unit. These evaluations were headed by international consultants and reviewed projects implemented by all five of the Ireland Aid block grant recipient NGOs. Two evaluations examined NGO block grant projects in India and Bangladesh as well as in Kenya, Uganda and Malawi. These evaluations proved to be extremely useful exercises both for Ireland Aid and for the NGOs concerned, as they highlighted the many strengths of the NGO work in these countries, while also pointing to areas which can and must be developed and improved in the future. The evaluation and audit unit also commissioned a financial management systems review of five further Irish NGOs which had expressed an interest in receiving an Ireland Aid block grant. The report of this review, which was conducted by independent external experts, is currently being finalised. An evaluation was also undertaken of the activities of the NGOs which had received Ireland Aid funding following the Gujarat earthquake in India.</P>
    <P>A number of major evaluations of NGO projects and programmes are planned for 2002. A comprehensive evaluation of Ireland Aid's in-country micro projects scheme is scheduled to commence later this month and will examine in detail the operation of this scheme, through which local and indigenous NGOs and missionaries can receive funding for relatively small development projects. It is anticipated that a major review of the operation of the main Ireland Aid NGO co-financing scheme will be conducted during the second half of 2002.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Ireland Aid programme, evaluation is seen as an essential tool in learning valuable development lessons and adopting new and improved ways of achieving real and sustainable positive change in the lives of the poor in the developing world. We must continue our efforts to ensure that aid is delivered as productively, effectively and efficiently as possible. The Ireland Aid programme is subject to rigorous peer review by an OECD development assistance committee. In 1999 the OECD published its most recent review of the Irish programme. The OECD review, which was very positive, stated that Ireland sets high standards for aid and pointed to a clear focus on poverty reduction. Preparations <Col N="130" /> for the next OECD peer review are scheduled to commence during 2003.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, an Ireland Aid review committee is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the structures, policies and programmes of the entire Ireland Aid programme. It is anticipated that the review committee will shortly report to Government on its findings. An important element of the work of the review committee has been consideration of how the official aid programme can best work in a complementary way with NGOs. During this process the committee has engaged actively with the NGO and missionary communities, as well as with other interested parties.</P>

The resolution of this question is essentially a matter for Lebanese politicians.</P>
      <P>A large scale withdrawal of Syrian troops from the vicinity of Beirut took place in June 2001 and further redeployment of forces might be expected in the context of a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East dispute. We look forward to a resumption of negotiations on all outstanding aspects of the peace process and urge all sides to take the necessary measures for this to happen. I would hope in this way that the situation is reached whereby there are no longer any foreign troops stationed in the countries of the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 49 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Government retains its strong commitment to supporting the vulnerable people of Afghanistan, involving the ongoing provision of emergency humanitarian assistance and supporting the process of national reconstruction in that country. Ireland has played a key role in ensuring that the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has been kept to the fore alongside the political aspects, including at the United Nations Security Council. In its ongoing contacts at the UN, within the EU and at other fora, the Government is emphasising that there must be a visible and effective strategy for meeting the needs of over 5 million people in Afghanistan who require humanitarian assistance. The urgency of assisting to those in acute need is underlined by the images we have seen of hunger in the region and the severe drought from which Afghanistan continues to suffer.</P>
      <P>During 2001, a total of &euro;5.08 million was provided by the Government in official humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. This commitment was enhanced by an Irish ministerial attendance at the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan in Tokyo in January of this year. At this conference I made a pledge of &euro;12 million in reconstruction assistance on behalf of the Irish people. These funds will be made available over the coming three years. This pledge is in addition to our ongoing emergency relief and recovery assistance, which combined with our reconstruction commitments, is likely to see our support to Afghanistan during 2002 exceed that provided last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Tokyo conference I outlined the need for strong co-ordination between humanitarian assistance, recovery, reconstruction and development in Afghanistan. This was reiterated by a number of donors. There was also general agreement on the central role which must be accorded to the people of Afghanistan and their representatives in the reconstruction process. The European Union has pledged &euro;600 million in 2002 for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. It is anticipated that similar amounts will be available in subsequent years. This substantial pledge by the EU, fully supported by Ireland, is an indication of a long-term commitment to Afghanistan. This pledge places the European Union at the very forefront of the challenge to rebuild Afghanistan. The Tokyo conference recognised that the UN has played and should continue to play a pivotal role in Afghanistan and Ireland fully supports this view. UNDP will lead the recovery effort on behalf of the UN system and will have a central role in the co-ordination of donor efforts. In Tokyo, I met the chairman of the interim Admin<Col N="132" /> istration of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, and the Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan. At these meetings I reiterated Ireland's continued commitment to assisting the Afghan people.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid officials are currently carrying out an assessment mission to Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan and are meeting Irish NGOs, UNDP and other regional representatives and co-ordinators as part of their field visit. This mission will assist in planning aid disbursement which is effective and which can target those most in need. The Government will continue to work closely with Irish NGOs, the UN, ICRC and our other implementing partners to ensure maximum co-ordination of the donor effort.</P>

      <P>It was agreed at Weston Park to appoint a judge of international standing to undertake a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion in the cases of Pat Finucane, Chief Superintendent Harry Breen, Superintendent Bob Buchanan, Robert Hamill, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright. It was further agreed that, unless this was clearly prejudicial to forthcoming prosecutions, the judge would begin his or her investigation into each case no later than April of this year. Both Governments have agreed to abide by the findings and recommendations of the international judge including any recommendation for a public inquiry in any of these cases.</P>
      <P>This matter has been the subject of ongoing and intensive discussions with the British authorities since Weston Park and I have discussed it with the Secretary of State, Dr. Reid, in the interim. Officials from both sides met on 18 January to discuss progress in finding a suitable candidate and how best to guide and support whoever may be appointed. Discussions have continued since then with a view to fulfilling the obligations undertaken at Weston Park. This issue will also be discussed when the Taoiseach meets the Prime Minister later this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Irish people have been shocked by the devastation wrought by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano in the Democratic Republic of Congo. That the DRC, a country wracked by a protracted war, and Goma, a city so familiar with hardship, should be the subject of such awesome destruction, added poignancy to the images of despair we all witnessed a fortnight ago. To date, it is estimated that approximately 150 people have lost their lives and 350,000 have been affected since lava began flowing from the volcano on January 17. Over 30,000 people are still in camps and thousands of homes have been destroyed.</P>
      <P>The Government's response has been rapid and substantive. On January 21, the Government announced &euro;800,000 in emergency aid to provide much needed humanitarian assistance to the victims of the volcano. This has now been increased to &euro;1 million, recognising the sterling work being undertaken by the Irish agencies in the region, the evolving crisis and reflecting the Government's unflinching commitment to the world's poorest and most vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>The &euro;1 million package has been divided between Concern, Trócaire, WorldVision, GOAL and Christian Aid. These agencies have been operating in the Goma area and in Rwanda, to which many of the people displaced by the volcano have fled. The invaluable work of our NGO partners is ensuring that people are being provided with shelter, health care, basic utensils and food. This is in addition to the crucial work being undertaken by the United Nations and the Red Cross organisations in the region. It is also worth noting that ECHO, the European Commission humanitarian office, has made &euro;3 million available for assistance to victims of the volcano.</P>
      <P>The Government's &euro;1 million aid package is in addition to &euro;1.33 million in assistance directed at the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2001 and almost &euro;4 million provided for humanitarian needs in the Great Lakes region last year alone. Since the mid-1990s, the Government has been striving to bolster conflict resolution and development in the region by investing heavily in aid and recovery programmes in the poorest parts of central Africa. This is a trend that is set to continue, as the Government's determination to assist the region remains resolute. As always, we shall continue to monitor the humanitarian situation and be ready to act with both focus and purpose when appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government proposes to offer emergency relief to the Nigerian Government in order to enable it to respond to the human tragedy caused by a recent fire at an armaments dump in Lagos.</Quest>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, on 27 January 2002 one of the Nigerian army's largest munitions stores exploded in Lagos causing widespread destruction and loss of life. It is understood that most deaths occurred not because of the actual explosions, but as a result of the ensuing confusion. Many people drowned in a canal when they tried to cross to safety and many others died in the stampedes which followed the explosions. It is estimated that 1,000 people lost their lives and that 2,400 families have been displaced.</P>
      <P>The Nigerian Red Cross responded rapidly to this disaster and in the first hours 200 volunteers were deployed to assist with the injured. Shelter for the homeless is being provided as well as food, clothing and medical supplies. The Nigerian Red Cross has also established a centre to reunite families and register the missing, particularly children. Over 300 people have been traced using community networks and the local media. On 31 January the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, deployed an emergency team to work closely with the Lagos state authorities, the Red Cross, NGOs and international organisations to provide support in the current crisis. It will also identify critical areas where the international community could be requested to complement local efforts. OCHA will play a key role in co-ordinating the relief efforts. The Irish Government is providing &euro;600,000 to OCHA through Ireland Aid for its work in disaster relief and co-ordination generally in order that it can quickly and effectively respond to situations such as that in Lagos.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid has been assisting Nigeria for many years. These funds are channelled through NGOs, missionaries and community groups with a record of working with the poor. The areas funded include health, education, vocational training, civic education, water, sanitation and maternity care. In the aftermath of the tragic explosion in Lagos the key need will be to help people to rebuild their lives and sustain their livelihoods. The susceptibility of vulnerable communities to disasters such as the Lagos explosions is often a symptom of their poverty and lack of development opportunity. In the case of the Lagos disaster Ireland stands ready to respond in support of local community efforts at rebuilding shattered lives and livelihoods via local projects and programmes. The Irish Embassy in Abuja is monitoring the situation closely and the aid administrator based at the embassy will visit Lagos in the near future.</P>

      <P>In December 2000 the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1333 as part of its ongoing campaign against international terrorism. The resolution provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the drawing up of a list of persons and entities associated with the Taliban, Osama Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organisation whose funds and financial assets were to be frozen. Following the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001, the asset freeze list was extended to include the Somalian money transfer bank Al-Barakaat. The European Union subsequently added Al-Barakaat to its asset freeze list in Council Regulation (EC) No. 2199/2001.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, expatriate Somalis use the money transfer system to send remittances to family members at home in Somalia. Al-Barakaat is the largest, but not the only, remittance bank operating this kind of system. It is earnestly to be hoped that any hardship caused as a result of the dislocation of the Al-Barakaat system may be alleviated by having recourse to the other such money transfer systems still operating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development &ndash; UNCED, the Rio Earth Summit &ndash; adopted Agenda 21, a framework for integrating and balancing economic, social and environmental policies in support of sustainable development. UNCED also gave rise to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Conventions on Biodiversity and Desertification and helped establish the UN Commission on Sustainable Development and the UN Forum on Forests.</P>
      <P>The UN General Assembly has decided to convene a World Summit on Sustainable Development, WSSD, in Johannesburg from 26 August to 4 September 2002 to review the progress made towards achieving sustainable development since UNCED. The summit will focus not only on environmental sectors such as forests, oceans, climate, energy and fresh water, but also poverty, development assistance, globalisation and new technologies in biology and communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparations for the WSSD at national, subregional and regional level are under way. The <Col N="136" /> second meeting of the preparatory committee is currently taking place in New York and it will meet again from 25 March to 5 April. The fourth and final meeting of the preparatory committee will take place in Indonesia from 27 May to 7 June at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>At regional level, Ireland with our EU partners participated in the WSSD regional preparatory meeting, convened by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, in Geneva last September. This regional meeting contributed to the process of identifying EU priorities in the run up to Johannesburg. The following priorities have emerged: pursuing poverty eradication and sustainable livelihoods; making globalisation work for sustainable development; protecting the natural resource base for economic and social development; achieving sustainable production and consumption patterns; and strengthening governance on sustainable development at all levels.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting in Gothenburg in June 2001 proposed that the Johannesburg summit should agree a new global deal or pact between North and South involving all relevant stakeholders to promote an integrated and focused approach to the implementation of Agenda 21. The possible content of such a global deal is one of the items currently being considered by the preparatory committee. The European Commission will issue a communication later this month which will further refine the process of identifying priority areas, constraints, challenges and mechanisms for future action to be considered at the Johannesburg summit.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government are co-chairing a national committee established to co-ordinate our approach to Johannesburg. The committee includes representatives from relevant Departments and from the NGO community. In addition, last December we convened an open public forum involving all of the relevant stakeholders, representatives of civil society and the UN secretariat to discuss the key issues which will arise at Johannesburg. From the national preparatory process to date, the following principles to guide our approach to the WSSD have emerged. Agenda 21 continues to offer a comprehensive blue-print for the achievement of sustainable development and Johannesburg should not attempt to reinvent it; Johannesburg should focus on a number of key issues in Agenda 21 and on agreeing strategies for their implementation; sustainable development cannot be achieved unless there is a real effort, at all levels, to promote sustainable production and consumption and based on our own positive experience of Comhar, the national partnership for sustainable development; and Johannesburg should address the over-arching issue of partnerships involving central and local government, the private sector and the NGOs to promote sustainable development.</P>
    <P>From a development perspective, Ireland <Col N="137" /> believes that poverty is the critical constraint to the achievement of sustainable development. My Department will make financing for sustainable development one of our priorities at Johannesburg. We particularly support the catalytic role of overseas development aid, ODA, in creating an enabling domestic environment for poor countries who are trying to mobilise the resources necessary to implement Agenda 21. We also support the importance of capacity building to enhance developing country efforts to meet the various obligations from the commitments already undertaken in Rio.</P>
    <P>My Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the NGO community, will continue to work closely together to contribute, at Johannesburg, to a reinvigorated global effort to implement Agenda 21 which remains central to the achievement of sustainable development.</P>

      <P>The Kashmir question is undoubtedly one of the most <Col N="138" /> serious and destabilising issues in the south Asian region. It has once again brought India and Pakistan close to a war whose effects would be felt throughout the entire region and, indeed, globally.</P>
      <P>We have conveyed our position and concerns on this issue to representatives of both Governments here in Dublin. In our meetings we have encouraged Pakistan to carry through its commitment to clamp down on terrorist activities. Drawing on our national experience, the Government has explained that a state can maintain political aspirations while denouncing and outlawing those who wish to achieve such goals through terrorism.</P>
      <P>Ireland has encouraged India to accept Pakistan's commitment. Again, drawing on our own experience, we have suggested that India should not give a veto to the enemies of peace by making dialogue with Pakistan conditional on the complete absence of terrorist activity. What is crucial is that the Pakistani Government dissociates itself from such activity and does all in its power to prevent terrorist acts.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that despite the large number of troops amassed on the two countries' border, both countries would seem to have moved back from the prospect of war.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, subject to ratification, on 7 October 1998.</P>
      <P>Before Ireland can ratify the Rome Statute, it is necessary that implementing legislation be enacted to give effect to its provisions in Irish law. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated in a reply to parliamentary Question No. 920 of 30 January that implementing legislation was currently being prepared by his Department and that he expected that legislative proposals would be ready for submission to Government relatively soon. Once this legislation is prepared, it must be put before the Oireachtas and, when passed by both Houses be signed into law by the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the implementing legislation is enacted, the remaining requirements for Ireland's ratification of the Rome Statute can be completed promptly. A resolution approving the terms of the Rome Statute should be placed before Dáil Éireann, in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, and when this is passed, the Government can arrange the deposit of Ireland's instrument of ratification with the Secretary Gen<Col N="139" /> eral of the United Nations, in accordance with Article 125 of the Rome Statute. The Rome Statute will come into force for Ireland 60 days after this.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the proposal to amend the Constitution to allow the State to ratify the Rome Statute was approved by the majority of voters in a referendum held last June. As a referendum petition challenging the outcome of the referendum is currently under appeal to the Supreme Court, the Bill amending the Constitution has not yet been signed into law by the President.

      <P>At the beginning of this year the Security Council decided to request regular briefings from the secretariat on the situation in the Middle East. In December 2001, a draft resolution was submitted to the council. Ireland and 11 other members of the council voted in favour of the resolution, but it failed to be adopted due to the veto exercised by the United States. The failure of this resolution, which was moderate and balanced in tone, was a matter of regret to us. A resolution in identical terms was introduced in the General Assembly of the United Nations on 18 December. Ireland once again voted in favour of the resolution and it was passed by a large majority.</P>
      <P>It is usual in the Security Council that initiatives on the Palestinian question are undertaken by the representatives of the non-aligned movement in the council in consultation with the Palestinian observer mission and we would expect any new initiative to originate in that way. Ireland would play a full part in seeking agreement in the council as we have done on previous occasions when the matter has been raised.</P>
      <P>The Government considers that international observers could play a useful role in the occupied territories and would support their deployment. As was stated in the declaration of the European Council at Laeken, &ldquo;The European Union remains convinced that setting up a third-party monitoring mechanism would serve the interests of both parties. It is prepared to play an active role in such a mechanism.&rdquo;  However, I would point out that such a deployment can only be made with the consent of the parties concerned. This consent is not forthcoming from the Israeli Government.</P>

      <P>The terms of employment, including leave, of all domestic staff are set in accordance with local practice and the employment laws and regulations of the host state, rather than Irish legislation. In this regard, salary scales are maintained in line with those offered by the local embassies as well as similar local public and private sector employment. They are adjusted on a regular basis to take account of local inflation.</P>
      <P>As an equal opportunity employer, it is not the practice of the Department to use nationality as a recruitment criterion for domestic staff. Accordingly, no records in regard to the nationality of domestic staff are kept.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any suggestion that any of our diplomatic missions has not been adhering to best local employment practices or that the conditions of employment are less than satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Recent statements by President Bush and senior figures in his administration have expressed legitimate concern at Iraq's continuing failure to co-operate with the UN disarmament mission and the threat posed by Iraqi efforts to develop <Col N="141" /> chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction. The US Administration has indicated that it is reviewing its policy on Iraq but that, at present, its efforts will continue to be focused on achieving agreement in the Security Council on reform of sanctions and for the return of the UN arms inspectors.</P>
      <P>There are no indications from our contacts with the US Administration or from discussions between the EU and USA on the subject of Iraq that the USA is considering military action in the immediate future. The USA is well aware of the particular sensitivities which would arise, not least in the Arab world, if it were to take unilateral military action against Iraq without clear evidence linking the regime of Saddam Hussein with terrorism. Ireland will continue to work with our EU partners and with others in the international community in an effort to ensure that any tensions are resolved without recourse to military action.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, 2001, which became law in December last year. The Act contains a wide range of measures which the British Government considers necessary in the light of the terrorist attacks of 11 September. The measures include the power to seize assets, to detain under the Immigration Act, 1971, and to search and fingerprint terrorist suspects. A significant proportion of the concerns expressed by civil liberties groups and others have been directed at the additional powers of detention which the Bill will give the Home Secretary in certain cases. Prior to the introduction of the Act, persons awaiting deportation under the Immigration Act, 1971, could be detained only if it were possible to deport them within a reasonable period of time. The new legislation allows the detention of persons awaiting deportation provided certain specific conditions are met. However, I am satisfied that these conditions are such that the new detention powers will not affect Irish persons living in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More generally, it is clear that a number of the measures in the Act will affect all persons living in the United Kingdom. I am satisfied that none of the measures will have a greater effect on Irish persons living in the UK than on British nationals <Col N="142" /> or other UK residents. As a result of the consideration of the Bill in Parliament, the operation of the detention provisions will be examined by a reviewer and the Act in its entirety will be reviewed in two years. The detention provisions may not be extended beyond November 2006.</P>

      <P>I regret the company's decision to introduce 230 redundancies at its plant in County Mayo. The decision is due to the current economic downturn, resulting in a restructuring of the company's worldwide operations. It is expected that the redundancy programme will be completed by the end of March 2002. FÁS, the national training and employment authority, currently has three officers involved in interviewing employees who are being made redundant at the company. As well as offering guidance interviews, FÁS is endeavouring to assess the training needs of the relevant employees. In addition, FÁS has held meetings with Meitheal Mhaigh Eo, the County Mayo Partnership Company and the Mayo Local Employment Service, which are also involved in providing appropriate assistance.</P>

    <P>On a more positive note, I am pleased that Fort Wayne Metals Research Products Corporation of the USA, a leading developer and producer of precision wire products for the world-wide medical devices industry, is to invest &euro;3.4 million, with the support of IDA Ireland, in the establishment of a European operations centre for the manufacture and distribution of its products at Castlebar, <Col N="143" /> County Mayo. The new facility will create 80 new jobs over the next five years. Fort Wayne Metals will be the first tenant at the new IDA business and technology park in the town. The Castlebar operation will manufacture, in a high quality, skilled operation, precision wire for the medical devices industry in Europe, where the company has a strong customer base. The new operation will be housed in a customised 25,000 sq. ft. facility which Fort Wayne Metals is to construct at the park and which it aims to have completed by the end of 2002. It will partner the National Centre of Biomedical Engineering Science at the National University of Ireland, Galway, to carry out research in some specific areas. I have asked the industrial development agencies to continue to do their utmost to secure alternative employment opportunities and actively promote Castlebar as a location for further investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Work permits are granted under the Aliens Act, 1935, and apply to all non-EU and non-EEA nationals for engagements for financial gain. The initiative must be taken by the employer to obtain the permit prior to entry into the State of the prospective employee. The application must relate to a specific job and to a named individual. The permits are issued to the employer for up to one year, provided the relevant labour and immigration requirements such as legal status and national minimum wage are met. They are specifically intended to relate to posts that cannot be filled by Irish or other EU or EEA nationals. Employers who apply for work permits are required to establish that it has not been possible, in spite of reasonable efforts made in co-operation with FÁS, to fill the vacancy from the Irish or broader EU or EEA labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The link between employer and employee in this instance is important as the process by which work permits are issued is relatively simple and the State exercises no role in terms of vetting the qualifications or suitability of the person for the job offered. It also means that the employer is prepared to take on the person concerned and he or she is, therefore, less likely to require State <Col N="144" /> benefits. Non-EEA personnel have the same rights as Irish persons in a similar position.</P>
    <P>While it is clearly expected that an employee will remain with the original employer for the duration of the work permit, my Department has dealt with a number of cases where employees, having decided for various reasons to leave their original employer, have not returned to their country of origin. Where such cases have been brought to our attention and where the employee has secured an offer of employment from another employer we have adopted a helpful and pragmatic approach by issuing new work permits. It is necessary, however, for the second employer in such cases to seek confirmation through FÁS that an Irish or EEA worker is not available and willing to take up the vacancy which is to be offered to the foreign worker. I have no immediate plans to change further the arrangements under which work permits are issued.</P>
    <P>The working visa or work authorisation scheme, which was introduced in June 2000, is available to those who have an offer from an employer in Ireland of employment in one of three designated high-skill categories, namely information and computing technologies, construction professionals and nurses. The important distinction in this scheme is that the employee holds the working visa or authorisation and the worker can change to different employment within the sector. In addition, the visa lasts for two years.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the work permits section of my Department has received the application to which the Deputy referred. Assuming the application is completed correctly and is otherwise in order, processing time will take approximately 12 weeks from the date of receipt of the application.</P>
      <P>The waiting list or backlog of work permit applications awaiting decision has increased from 1,900 on 1 January 2001 to 6,953 applications last December and is directly related to the increase in the number of applications being received. The backlog on 31 January 2002 stood at 5,529 applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of work permit applications increased from an average of more than 350 per week in 2000 to more than 825 per week last year. The level of applications climbed during the year and in December alone, an unprecedented 5,690 applications were received. New procedures were introduced with effect from 2 January 2002 and this has resulted, at least temporarily, in a reduction in the number of applications received. The average number of complete and valid appli<Col N="145" /> cations for January 2002 was 325 applications per week.</P>
    <P>While the staff of the section was increased by 50% last year in an effort to reduce processing time, the very large increase in applications meant the waiting period could not be reduced. Nevertheless, the staff in the section issued 36,436 permits in 2001, compared with some 18,000 in the year 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the closure of Irish Ispat Limited last year, my Department applied to the European Commission for re-adaptation aid under Article 56(2)(<i>b</i>) of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty for employees who had been made redundant as a result of the closure of the company. One of the conditions for receipt of ECSC aid is that the member state concerned should pay matching funding to the employees before the ECSC aid is transferred by the Commission. In the case of this application, the Exchequer matching funds were paid to the ex-employees in December 2001. The ECSC aid funds are expected to be transferred by the Commission within a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>In the case of a previous application to the European Commission for re-adaptation aid funding in respect of steel workers who were made redundant as a result of the 1994 restructuring plan, the application for such funding was made by my Department on the basis that the extra statutory redundancy payments made to these workers constituted the State's matching funds. The extra statutory redundancy payments which had been paid by the company were taken into consideration in a State aid package made to the company in 1996 which effectively resulted in a contribution being made directly from Exchequer funds towards the extra statutory redundancy payments. The State's position regarding the matching funding was accepted by the Commission which, in any event, would have transferred the ECSC aid only when it was satisfied that the criteria regarding matching funding had been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State's position on matching funding was in line with the 1991 convention between the European Commission and the Government of Ireland which defines the terms and conditions for the granting of ECSC re-adaptation aid. A legal opinion produced by the Attorney General in September 1999 supported the State's interpretation of the 1991 convention. Therefore, there are no matching payments outstanding to the for<Col N="146" /> mer employees in respect of ECSC re-adaptation aid.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The right of the Palestinian people to a viable, independent and democratic state has long been supported by Ireland. This right was further endorsed by the European Council at Laeken in December, together with Israel's right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. The fact that a Palestinian state is an indispensable element of any peaceful solution to the Middle East conflict has also been recognised by the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel. The final form which that state will take is a matter for negotiation between the parties on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Ireland has constantly urged the parties to resume negotiations towards a final settlement. The Mitchell Committee report and the Tenet ceasefire plan offer the best available means to get such negotiations under way. This is also the view of our European Union partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All settlements in the occupied territories are <Col N="148" /> illegal and should be removed. The eventual fate of the illegal settlements is a matter for negotiation between the parties to the conflict and must be considered as part of the final status talks. I am conscious that a significant number of casualties have occurred in the vicinity of the settlements, mainly Palestinian but also some Israeli. Ireland abhors all acts of violence and I have made this clear to both sides. I have urged the need for restraint on the Israeli authorities in dealing with demonstrations, or in responding to attacks, on numerous occasions and have condemned the unjustified and disproportionate use of force before in this House. I have also urged on President Arafat the need to prevent terrorist acts to the greatest extent possible, including acts against settlements. There is no military solution to the problems of the region. Progress and security for all can only come about through negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the suffering caused by the civil conflict in Algeria. The internal security situation remains extremely volatile and the recent period has been marked by a further increase in killings, with Islamic extremists continuing to target the civilian population. Ireland, together with our EU partners, supports efforts to achieve a process of genuine political dialogue in Algeria. In a statement during the UN Third Committee debate on human rights in the recently concluded session of the General Assembly, the EU underlined the need for a greater respect for human rights by the security forces and expressed cautious support for new initiatives announced by the Algerian authorities for political, social and economic reforms.</P>
      <P>The dialogue between the EU and Algeria will be enhanced by the recently negotiated EU-Algeria Association Agreement based on the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Article 2 of that agreement states that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will guide the internal and international politics of the parties and will constitute an essential element of the agreement. The agreement also commits Algeria to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. Ireland expects to see these commitments implemented fully in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland attaches particular importance to <Col N="149" /> human rights issues in our bilateral relations with Algeria. We have urged the Algerian authorities to establish independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and to bring those responsible to justice. We have called on Algeria to facilitate the requests for visits which have been made by the UN special human rights rapporteurs on torture and extrajudicial executions. As I have indicated before, the Government has noted the constructive action taken by the Algerian authorities in response to the recent critical report and recommendations of an independent inquiry established by President Bouteflika into the causes of the unrest in the Berber region of Kabylie. The Government hopes there will be further follow-up action to those recommendations. We hope that the Algerian authorities will now go on to establish similar, independent mechanisms to investigate allegations of human rights abuses arising from the wider civil conflict in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland continues to monitor closely the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since my reply to the Deputy on this matter last November there have been no major political developments to report. The European Council in Laeken in December 2001 reaffirmed the EU's full support for the Lusaka and Arusha Agreements as the only tools capable of bringing the countries of the region to a lasting understanding and to true stabilisation. In that context, we appreciate the European Commission's undertaking to sign the National Indicative Programme for the DRC with a view to the resumption of the inter-Congolese dialogue. I believe that this sends a strong signal of the EU's commitment to the people of the DRC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1376, 2001, in November which builds on previous Security Council resolutions and charts a way forward for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the DRC and for the disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, resettlement or reintegration of the negative forces operating in eastern DRC. The resolution acknowledges the progress made so far in implementing the Lusaka Agreement, including the fact that the ceasefire is generally holding, despite some infringements, and the fact that some foreign forces have withdrawn from the DRC, including all Namibian troops. The resolution states the Council's support for the launch<Col N="150" /> ing of phase III of the deployment of MONUC, the UN Mission in the DRC. MONUC's task during phase III will be to assist in the voluntary disarmament of negative forces, including perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide and Burundian rebels, and in the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Congo. To this end the active cooperation of all parties will be required and the Resolution sets out the steps necessary, including the establishment of a direct, confidence-building dialogue between the governments of the DRC and Rwanda.</P>
    <P>Ireland played an active role in the drafting of the three Security Council resolutions on the situation in the DRC adopted since we took our seat over a year ago, and we have sought to ensure that the DRC remains high on the Council's list of priorities. At the General Affairs Council in November 2001, my EU colleagues and I welcomed the adoption of the Resolution by the UN Security Council and endorsed the requests made to States which have still not begun to withdraw their forces from the DRC. We are seriously concerned about the support being given to the armed groups in the east of the DRC and about the human rights situation throughout the DRC territory.</P>
    <P>We welcome the UN Security Council's decision to extend the mandate of the panel of experts for a further six months. The addendum to the panel of experts report on the exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the DRC provides evidence of the ongoing exploitation by all sides in the conflict of the DRC's human and natural resources to finance their war efforts. While the exploitation of the DRC's resources did not cause the war, it undoubtedly has contributed to its continuation.</P>

      <P>The Prime Minister of Ethiopia is currently on a visit to Ireland. I had the welcome opportunity yesterday to meet with Prime Minister Meles and Foreign Minister Seyoum for a broad and open discussion on the political situation in Ethiopia and on wider regional concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN Security Council will send a mission to Addis Ababa, Asmara and the temporary security zone from 20 to 25 February. Ireland will participate in this mission, which aims to encourage confidence building measures and to promote reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as to relay to the parties the monumental importance attached to their acceptance of the boundary commission's determination, which will be the ultimate measure of their commitment to the peace process. The boundary commission <Col N="151" /> established under the Algiers Agreement has been presiding over the delimitation and demarcation of the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. With the commission due to reach its decision at the end of this month, I welcomed the Ethiopian Government's reiteration that it will abide by the findings of the commission and I stressed the importance to the peace process that both sides fully respect the findings as committed to under the Algiers Agreement.</P>
    <P>As regards the internal situation in Ethiopia we welcome Prime Minister Meles' statement to Parliament which called for a greater role for the opposition, a more constructive relationship with the press and a real devolution of power to the regions and lower level councils. The European Union has begun consultations with the Government of Ethiopia under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, which provides for general dialogue on specific issues. The discussions, which got off to a very good start in Addis Ababa on 28 January, centre on the improvement of democratic institutions, the reinforcement of democratic practices and the rule of law. We welcome the close interest displayed by the Government of Ethiopia, and by Prime Minister Meles personally, in the consultations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to his questions of 22 November 2001, in which I outlined my general position, and that of the EU, regarding the development and maintenance of stability in the western Balkans. Since 22 November, the General Affairs Council has met twice, on 10-11 December 2001 and on 28-29 January. On both occasions, the council, as is its normal practice, discussed the situation in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland continues to work with the various international organisations active in the western Balkans. In April 2001 Ambassador Antóin Mac Unfraidh was nominated to head the European Union monitor mission in former Yugoslavia and his mandate was extended recently to 31 December 2002. The secondment of civilian, Defence Forces and Garda personnel to the EUMM and OSCE missions in the Western Balkans continues, as does the secondment of Defence <Col N="152" /> Forces personnel to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Ireland continues to assist the region through its bilateral aid programme and through active participation in the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. In general terms, progress with regard to the establishment of democracy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its constituent republic of Serbia has continued. Belgrade's relations with its neighbours, in particular Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina, would appear to have improved steadily in recent months. However, more work is required by all parties on all matters related to the return of refugees and displaced persons.</P>
    <P>High Representative Solana has been to the fore over the past few months in encouraging and facilitating dialogue between Belgrade and Podgorica on the constitutional future of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Both capitals have been reminded of the council's view that staying together in a fully functioning federal state is the fastest route to participation in European integration. However, should the current process result in a referendum, this would have to be conducted in accordance with the democratic standards of a constitutional state and with the Montenegrin constitution. Ireland would be prepared to contribute observers to monitor a referendum, should one be called.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to support firmly the regional approach of the European Union in deepening cooperation with all the countries of the former Yugoslavia and providing solid foundations for increased prosperity and stability across the region. The stabilisation and association process, SAP, represents the best way forward in terms of the integration of the western Balkans countries into European structures while building regional structures. The council, in January, restated the Union's willingness to begin negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement with Albania but noted that attention had been diverted from the necessary reforms essential to such agreements. The recent resignation of Albanian Prime Minister Meta could further delay the reform process and retard the opening of real dialogue with Albania.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my view, which is shared by partners, that Kosovo remains a key factor for regional stability. I regret that, having conducted legislative elections in a peaceful and orderly fashion in November, the Kosovo Assembly has not yet elected a president. This is causing a delay in the establishment of provisional instruments of self-government and the transfer of authority from the UN mission in Kosovo to those institutions, as provided for in Security Council Resolution 1244. I welcome the recent indications from Belgrade that the 162 Kosovar Albanians held in Serb prisons will have their files examined and, by 31 March at the latest, political prisoners will be set free and common criminals will be sent, if they should so wish, to serve their sentence in prisons close to their place of origin. This is an issue which I raised with the Yugoslav For<Col N="153" /> eign Minister in New York when we met in November and which my officials raised in various fora.</P>

      <P>The situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia remains of concern in view of the importance of this country to the stability of the western Balkans. In this context, I would draw the Deputy's attention to my replies to his previous questions on the situation in FYROM on 16 October and 22 November last.</P>
      <P>It remains imperative that all political parties in FYROM demonstrate their full commitment to the thorough and rapid implementation of the Ohrid framework agreement. In this context, the recent passage through the FYROM national parliament of the law on local self government is important. This law, which devolves power from the centre to local government, gives the minority Albanian community a role in governance and was an essential element of the Ohrid agreement. It had been hoped that agreement on the law could have been reached by early December 2001; when this agreement was not forthcoming, the international community decided to postpone an international donors' conference scheduled for 20 December. A rescheduled donors' conference has now been called for 12 March 2002. Indications are that all laws addressed in the Ohrid agreement should be passed by the end of May, which would pave the way for elections after that date. Earlier elections had been foreseen under the terms of the agreement. The expected laws on municipal boundaries and electoral districts, which depend on the results of a census, will have to wait, as the expected census has been postponed from April to October this year.</P>
      <P>It will be important to maintain the momentum for peace in the coming months and for local leaders, in particular, to avoid provocation and intimidation. High Representative Solana passed on this message when he visited Skopje last month. In this context, it is noteworthy that the re-entry of police into ethnic Albanian areas has been progressing well, although slower than had been expected under the Ohrid agreement.</P>

      <Col N="154" /> Ireland, with its European Union partners, has pledged to support the process of political and socio-economic transition in Mozambique. We continue to carefully monitor the political dialogue between the ruling Frelimo party and the opposition Renamo party.</P>
    <P>The political situation in Mozambique remains stable. On the economic front, Mozambique has experienced significant growth in recent years. While flooding in the past two years has undermined economic progress, the economy experienced positive growth in 2001. Ireland welcomes the Government's efforts in resettling the population, resuming food production and basic services, and reconstructing basic infrastructures.</P>
    <P>Mozambique is a priority country for Ireland Aid, and a total of &euro;29.26 million has been allocated for the country programme for 2002.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government continues to closely monitor issues in Nigeria. We consider that the situation generally has improved since President Obasanjo came to power in May 1999. However, the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in a number of states in northern Nigeria in the course of the last two years has exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions there.</P>
      <P>In January, there was a major fire at an army munitions dump in the commercial capital Lagos, which claimed the lives of several hundred people. Together with our EU partners, we send our condolences to the Government of Nigeria and to the victims of this tragedy.</P>
      <P>We are concerned at the continuing sporadic outbreaks of ethnic tensions in Nigeria and the involvement of Nigerian troops. Any indiscriminate use of force by the military must be strongly discouraged by the Nigerian Government. In late December 2001, the Attorney General and Minister for Justice, Chief Bola Ige was shot dead. We welcome the efforts of the Nigerian authorities to bring to justice the perpetrators of this crime.</P>
      <P>With regard to the case of the woman sentenced to death by stoning, the Government has made known its very deep concern to the Federal Government. The punishment is currently being appealed to the Sokoto State Supreme Court and a ruling is expected in March. We urge the Nigerian Government to respond positively to the international concerns about this case and to comply with their international human rights obligations.</P>

      <P>The internal security situation in Rwanda remains relatively calm. The new Government of National Unity has a term of four years until 2003, when elections are due to be held.</P>
      <P>Last November, the EU General Affairs Council adopted a new Common Position on Rwanda which aims to encourage and support national reconciliation and the transition to democracy. Efforts are being made to gradually rebuild the country's justice system which was almost completely destroyed in the 1994 genocide. An International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, ICTR, was set up in 1995 under UN Security Council Resolution 995 to try those most responsible for the genocide. Gacaca courts are also being set up to try genocide suspects who are still being detained but who are not wanted by the ICTR. It is hoped that these courts will administer justice in an even-handed way that is fair both to defendants and to their victims. </P>
      <P>We are encouraged by the recent agreement between President Kagame and President Museveni of Uganda which aims to reduce sources of tension between the two countries and thereby contribute to regional stability.</P>

      <P>Ireland has taken a strong forward position on the political and humanitarian situation in Somalia during our year on the UN Security Council. We gave prominence to Somalia during our Presidency of the Security Council in October 2001 when we chaired the first full public debate on Somalia in 18 months. The public debate was very constructive and, as President of the Security Council, I had the honour of issuing a substantial statement on the situation in the country on behalf of Council members.</P>
      <P>At the UN Security Council public meeting on Africa on 29 January which the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell attended, we gave particular mention to Somalia and called on regional countries to work together to support peace in Somalia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland firmly believes the Arta process continues to be the most viable basis for peace and national reconciliation in Somalia, and we will continue to support it. Ireland is also a member of the International Partners Forum, IPF, which supports the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, IGAD. We have indicated <Col N="156" /> our support for IGAD's efforts to build peace and stability in Somalia, and see these efforts as complementary to the Arta process.</P>
    <P>When I met the Prime Minister of Ethiopia yesterday I urged the Government of Ethiopia, as a frontline State, to use its influence on key parties in Somalia to attend the upcoming summit in Kenya which has been mandated by IGAD. It is crucial that the people of Somalia themselves determine the future of their country.</P>
    <P>We are also conscious that the humanitarian situation in the country remains poor. Ten years without effective Government and poor climatic conditions have seriously undermined the ability of the people to provide for themselves adequately. As a consequence, Ireland contributed more than &euro;1.2 million in humanitarian assistance in 2001 to meet the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in Somalia.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in Africa remains a matter of serious international concern. I share this concern, particularly in relation to the ongoing problems of starvation and human rights abuses. Global hunger is now estimated as affecting 830 million people worldwide, and the problem is particularly critical in Africa. The World Food Programme has estimated that up to 16 million people are affected by hunger in the Greater Horn of Africa alone. The scale of hunger in Africa makes it a major priority for Ireland Aid. We have co-operated closely with our EU partners, and other major multilateral donors such as the World Food Programme, to tackle the humanitarian crises which have affected the continent. Ireland Aid has been actively involved in providing emergency relief to Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola and Sierra Leone. In 2001, Ireland Aid provided almost &euro;14 million to fund emergency relief and rehabilitation programmes for Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU's Food Aid and Food Security Policy is a key element of the Community's response to famines and food security crises in Africa. Ireland Aid has been working closely with our EU partners to improve the effectiveness of this policy and the European Commission has now presented a Communication on the Evaluation <Col N="157" /> and future Orientation of Food Aid Policy and Food Aid Management. This will give effect to a number of key recommendations which will improve the impact of EC food aid. These changes, which should make food aid more effective and responsive, have included a re-focusing of efforts towards strategic and sectoral issues, the introduction of country strategy papers to assist in streamlining rules and procedures and closer co-ordination of efforts with NGOs and recipient governments.</P>
    <P>At UN level, Ireland has strongly supported the target adopted by the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. The Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Plan of Action, adopted at the World Food Summit, WFS, in 1996 set out the way towards the achievement of the goal. The follow-up conference to the World Food Summit will take place later this year, and will provide a key opportunity to review progress towards meeting the WFS target, and to renew global commitment at political level to the task of eliminating hunger and malnutrition in Africa.</P>
    <P>The problems of starvation and human rights abuses in Africa are interlinked, and clearly demonstrate the vital importance of good governance for the sustainable development of the continent. All of Ireland Aid's activities, including our programmes with our developing country partners, are based on the fundamental principles of good governance, respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It is clear also that conflict and political instability in Africa lead to famine and human rights abuses. We are addressing these inter-related issues through an unprecedented increase in the volume of overseas development assistance in line with Ireland's commitment to reaching the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2007; using our current membership of the UN Security Council to work towards the resolution of conflicts in Africa; participating in efforts to assist conflict resolution and post-conflict reconciliation. These have included participating in UN peace-keeping operations in regions of conflict, such as the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE; funding to support the Inter-Congolese dialogue, and assistance for the Special Court in Sierra Leone which is a key part of the process of post-conflict normalisation and the restoration of the rule of law there; increasing our national contribution to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights by 55% in 2002 to &euro;2.16 million; co-operating with our EU partners in addressing serious human rights concerns in Africa, including Zimbabwe; providing funding for the key UN organisations, the World Food Programme, food and agriculture organisations and the International Fund for Agricultural Development, involved in helping the starving and in promoting food security.</P>
    <P>Starvation and human rights abuses are major obstacles to the development of Africa. The <Col N="158" /> Government, in close co-operation with our partners in the EU and UN, will continue to work to address these problems through a comprehensive programme of long-term development assistance, emergency relief, conflict prevention and resolution, and support for efforts to promote good governance, democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law in Africa.</P>

A substantial amount of Ireland's aid budget is allocated for payments to these international and multilateral development and finance bodies. In 2000 a total of &euro;93.35 million was channelled through multilateral development assistance agencies, equal to 36.5% of Ireland's overall aid expenditure, i.e the Ireland Aid budget plus funding from other Government departments which may be accounted as overseas development assistance.</P>
      <P>The reduction of poverty is the over-arching objective of the Government's programme of development assistance. All funding, whether bilateral, channelled through non-governmental organisations or allocated to the development activities of international organisations, must meet this objective. Our multilateral funding enables us to contribute to the global fight against poverty while maintaining a clear focus on our bilateral aid programme.</P>
      <P>Our contribution to EU development activities are obligatory and arise out of our membership of the European Union and our ratification of the Lomé Conventions, now the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement. There has been a wide public debate on the strengths and weaknesses of the EU development assistance programme recently, including the backlog of aid commitments which have remained unspent over several years. Ireland, together with a number of other like-minded member states, has been very active in pressing the European Commission to reform the management of the aid programme to make it more effective.</P>
      <P>This political pressure and the wide public debate has had a very positive influence on the management of external aid. While there is a need for further progress, I strongly welcome what has been achieved so far and I am confident EU development assistance is now more efficient and better managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's contributions to the UN agencies are <Col N="159" /> voluntary. Our contributions to the United Nations reflect our strong commitment to the role of the UN in promoting economic and social progress in accordance with the UN charter. In allocating funds to the UN agencies, we look at coherence with our objectives, management strength, effectiveness and efficiency, a commitment to UN reform and a clear focus on poverty reduction. In order to build on the strengths of our partnership with the UN, we are now focusing our aid on a more limited number of UN agencies which meet these criteria.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contributions to multilateral organisations are a vital component of a balanced and comprehensive approach to development assistance. Ireland Aid will continue to work in partnership with key multilateral organisations to ensure that we succeed in our overall objective of helping developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided in September 2000 to move progressively to the UN target for overseas development of 0.7% of GNP. The intention is that this target will be met by 2007 and that an interim target of 0.45% of GNP will be achieved by the end of 2002. Following this decision, agreement was reached between the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs on a three-year allocation for Vote 39 for the period 2001 &ndash; 2003.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the bilateral programme of Ireland Aid is concentrated on six poor countries in Africa. These are Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho. The involvement in these countries is guided by individual development co-operation agreements with these countries. The question of whether there might be an increase or decrease in the number of countries with which we have bilateral aid agreements is under consideration by the Ireland Aid review, which is nearing completion. Given the degree to which co-ordination of bilateral and multilateral donor efforts with partner countries is growing, there is a question over the necessity for formal intergovernmental agreements to underpin our bilateral aid programme with particular countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amnesty International does not produce a top ten list of countries in regard to human rights violations. The Department of Foreign Affairs is not aware of any other human rights organisations producing such a list. Human rights are a priority of this Government and a central com<Col N="161" /> ponent of our foreign policy. In co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned states, the Government continually monitors human rights in many countries throughout the world. The international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns and these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all Governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
    <P>This Government has commented publicly on many occasions on those situations which give rise to grave concern, in a national capacity and as a member of the EU and the Council of Europe. These concerns have also been raised on a consistent basis by this country's representatives at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. Ireland plays an active role in the third committee of the UN General Assembly and closely co-ordinates with EU partners in identifying priorities and strategies for human rights issues. At the most recent session of the third committee, the EU sponsored resolutions with regard to human rights in Sudan, Iran, Iraq and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all of which were adopted by vote. Ireland also co-sponsored Sweden's resolution on human rights in Burma/Myanmar. In addition, Ireland's resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance was adopted by consensus. Ireland has also been closely concerned with human rights issues at the UN Security Council, since taking up our seat in January 2001.</P>
    <P>Concerted international pressure applied through multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe is one of the most effective means of combating human rights abuses. However, despite the efforts of the global community in international and regional fora, it has to be acknowledged that the systems in place for preventing and tackling flagrant human rights abuses do not always prove adequate. Reasons for this range from the failure of states to ratify relevant international instruments to a lack of resources and even political will to focus on these problems.</P>
    <P>Ireland is actively engaged in the discussion of specific issues with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the Human Security Network. This initiative of the Canadian and Norwegian Governments is aimed at establishing the principle of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to conflict. The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards and will continue to voice its concerns, wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the UN Security Council.</P>

      <P>A series of earthquakes, the strongest of which measured 6.2 on the Richter scale, hit the western Turkish province of Afyon on Sunday 3 February. The epicentre was located in the provincial capital Bolvadin. The Turkish authorities have declared that 44 people were killed, a further 300 were injured and structural damage was caused to more than 600 buildings.</P>
      <P>The disaster rescue operations have been scaled down with the focus now switching to providing assistance to the survivors. Initial needs assessments indicate a requirement for shelter materials due to the freezing night time conditions. The Turkish Prime Minister has indicated that the survivors will receive the necessary relief supplies with blanket and tent distributions already under way. The Turkish authorities have also dispatched specialised civil defence teams to the area and troops have set up tented accommodation to house the homeless.</P>
      <P>The earthquake is significantly less destructive than the earthquake which struck north west Turkey in 1999, which claimed the lives of 18,000 people. At that time the Irish Government allocated &euro;940,000 in humanitarian funding to the disaster relief effort.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to which Ireland is contributing &euro;600,000 in 2002, will dispatch a disaster assessment team to co-ordinate in the relief effort. While the Turkish Government has not, as yet, requested a major international humanitarian response, Ireland Aid is continuing to monitor developments closely and is awaiting UNOCHA's assessment of needs.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there are 26 local offices throughout the country, which process applications under the ewe premium and suckler cow premium schemes. Special beef premium and slaughter premium scheme payments are processed in a central unit in Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>Some &euro;749 million has been paid to farmers to date under the various 2001 schemes. Under EU rules premium payments are pre-financed from national funds and recouped from the European Commission on average six weeks later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different retention periods apply in regard to the schemes but in the case of the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme the application period ran from 2 January to 29 June 2001 and most of the 66,900 applications were received in the May-June period. The retention period ran for six months from the time of application so that the retention period for June applicants did not finish <Col N="164" /> until December 2001. Under the protocol on direct payments to farmers advance payments of 60% were due to commence on 16 October. Where the retention period was completed by 16 October all eligible advance payments were to be made by 1 December. In other eligible cases such advance payments were to be made within 30 days of the end of the retention period. However, following strong representation by me to the European Commission, it agreed to increase the advance payment to 80% of entitlement for 2001.</P>
    <P>Payments commenced on 26 October, the day the EU regulation giving effect to the increased payment was published. To date, 80% advance payments valued in excess of &euro;153 million has been paid to all eligible applicants under the suckler cow premium scheme, representing 92% of all applicants. Balancing payments &ndash; 20% &ndash; commenced on 31 January 2002 in line with our commitment in the protocol on direct payments to farmers. To date, some &euro;30 million has been paid to 71% of applicants. These balancing payments will continue over the coming months with a view to ensuring that all eligible cases are paid by 30 June 2002 in accordance with the protocol and EU rules. Those farmers who have not yet received their advance payment will, assuming that their application is in order, receive 100% entitlement at balancing payment stage.</P>
    <P>Experience over the years has been that a small percentage of applications remain under query during the month of January before balancing payments commence. In all cases the farmers concerned have been made aware of the problem with their applications and cases are being cleared for payment on an ongoing basis. My Department is obliged to carry out a range of checks and controls including cross-checks against the bovine animal database CMMS with a view to ensuring, <i>inter alia, </i>that the animals applied on were in the herd at the time of applications; the animals supplied on &ndash; or suitable replacements &ndash; remained in the herd for the full retention period; and the heifer-cow ratio is respected. Some of these checks are carried out during the retention period. Obviously, the retention period check itself can only be made after the full retention period has expired.</P>
    <P>My Department has been making progressive use of databases in processing applications since 1997-98. In line with EU requirements cross-checks against the CMMS have been intensified since January 2000. The relevant regulation stipulates that premium can only be paid in respect of an animal which is properly recorded on the CMMS.</P>
    <P>Under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme, more than 1.1 million animal tag numbers have been cross-checked in this manner and difficulties initially arose in respect of about 30,000 tags or 2.7% of animals. These difficulties mainly relate to farm-to-farm movements where, unfortunately, either the seller or buyer or both fail to notify the movement to the CMMS. In a number of cases, animals being supplied on as cows were, <Col N="165" /> according to the CMMS, heifers at the time of application. It has also transpired that some farmers who have already received an advance payment now appear to have slaughtered cows before the end of the retention period without notifying my Department of eligible replacements. There are also other outstanding queries under this scheme relating to issues such as area aid problems, milk quota, etc. In all such cases the farmers concerned have been advised of the outstanding problem.</P>
    <P>My Department is making every effort, through contact with individual herdowners, to have all outstanding cases cleared for payment. Therefore it is most important that farmers respond promptly to queries. In light of the foregoing, I believe that the delivery of payments is highly efficient.</P>

The tallow is derived from specified risk material that was produced and handled in accordance with Irish and EU law and is stored under the supervision and control of my Department.

      <P>Under the 1998 ewe premium scheme the person named applied on 148 ewes. Following an inspection of his flock, 80 ewes were found at locations not declared on his application form. As there was no record of prior written notification on the file regarding the movement of these sheep as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme, he was notified by the district superintendent that the penalty was the loss of all premium. The person named appealed this decision by the district inspector but it was rejected. He subsequently submitted an appeal to the appeals unit in Agriculture House which upheld the original decision made. I am making arrangements to have the case re-examined and my Department will be in touch with the person concerned as soon as the re-examination has been completed.</P>

      <P>The procedure for disposing of reactor animals under the TB and brucellosis disease eradication schemes operates on the basis that meat factories tender on a weekly basis for the slaughter of these animals and my Department selects the meat factories on the basis of the prices that they offer for different types of animals.</P>
      <P>The compensation for reactor animals comprises the salvage value of the animal which is paid by the factory directly to the farmer and a reactor grant, or live valuation less the salvage value, paid to the farmer by my Department.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that at all times the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer and, therefore, the contract for the salvage value is a matter between the farmer and the meat factory involved. My Department's responsibility is to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and to pay the appropriate compensation.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances where a factory goes out of business, such as has happened in the case in question, the recovery of any moneys due to losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between themselves and the company's liquidators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>While the treatment of married and co-habiting couples under the social welfare code is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I point out to the Deputy that in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple. I understand that this judgment has been put into effect by treating co-habiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>In relation to taxation, there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together. In this context, I point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. Generally, the basis for the current taxation of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the issue of the tax treatment of cohabiting couples was examined most recently in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, co-habiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group, which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in May 1997, reported in August 1999. The report is available from the Government Publications Sale Office. The group was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further.</P>
      <P>In budget 2000 I initiated the process of band widening with a view to establishing progressively a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. When this process is complete the position of all couples will be the same with respect to the standard rate tax band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of married couples in relation to income tax is accorded recognition through the married person's tax credit and the home carer's tax credit. I have no plans to change the arrangements in that regard. The working group acknow<Col N="168" /> ledged that a key issue in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law on the matter. For that reason, and while I am cognisant of the issues faced by cohabiting couples, I have no plans to extend the married person's tax credit to such couples at the present time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of a covenant, the position is that there is no longer any tax benefit in one partner in a cohabiting situation taking out a deed of covenant in favour of the other partner. Sections 12 and 13 of the Finance Act, 1995, now Section 792 Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, restricted the tax relief available for deeds of covenant for individuals to the following categories as follows: unrestricted tax relief is available on covenants in favour of minors who are permanently incapacitated other than from parents to their own minor incapacitated children; unrestricted tax relief is available on covenants in favour of adults who are permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity; and, tax relief, not exceeding 5% of the covenantor's total income, is available on covenants in favour of adults aged over 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU White Paper on Food Safety, published in 1999, outlined a programme for future EU legislation in this area. The White Paper proposed to harmonise European legislation concerning fortified foods, but, as yet, no specific legislation has been proposed by the Commission. However, a Commission proposal is expected sometime later this year and will cover foods fortified with vitamins and minerals.</P>
      <P>Currently, in Ireland there is no specific legislation that restricts the fortification of food other than the general food safety legislation that prevents manufacturers from marketing unsafe food. Legislation governing nutritional labelling ensures that if a manufacturer claims that a food is rich in a certain nutrient, it must label the nutrients in line with the legislation. In relation to vitamins, manufacturers must list the vitamins and the percentage of the recommended daily allowance which they provide in a typical serving. Hence, the consumer can make informed choices in their purchasing patterns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fortification of foods differs between mem<Col N="169" /> ber states. The Scandinavian countries for example do not allow fortified foods while Ireland and the UK have markets in fortified foods which have been operating for many years. The ban on fortified food in some countries does not tend to be on safety grounds but rather on dietary grounds. These countries do not see a need for fortified foods. The other member states may have certain restrictions and maximum limits for some foodstuffs. Hence, at present the same brand of cereal in different countries could contain very different vitamin and mineral fortification.</P>
    <P>We are unaware of any risk assessment in Ireland on fortified foods, but the FSAI will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question about another scheme, I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the motorised transport grant which comes under the aegis of my Department. This is a means tested payment administered by the health boards. The purpose of this grant is to provide assistance to persons with a disability who may need a car to obtain or retain employment or to provide assistance to persons with a disability who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems. The maximum motorised transport grant is currently &euro;4,370, effective from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive the motorised transport grant, applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving licence; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; and the motorised transport must be a necessity in order for the person to obtain or retain employment or the person must have a transport requirement because of very isolated circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> Applications may also be considered in cases where persons with severe disabilities are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and, therefore, they must be driven to and from their place of employment. In such cases, the car must be purchased by the person with a disability and the name of the person who will drive this person to and from his or her place of employment must be notified to the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>If a person feels that he or she may qualify for the motorised transport grant, he or she should contact the relevant health board for further details and an application form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding the current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001 and concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group. In addition, I understand that a concerted overseas recruitment campaign will be initiated shortly on behalf of the health boards for scarce <Col N="174" /> physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy personnel.</P>
      <P>I am aware, in the context of work carried out by my Department with health service employers and IMPACT on the Joint Review Group on Psychology Services in the Health Service, that shortages of psychology staff, including clinical psychologists, exist in the health service. The review group identified that a key factor was the inadequate number of postgraduate training places available.</P>
      <P>A workforce planning exercise carried out under the aegis of the review recommended the provision of approximately 30 additional postgraduate training places in psychology. Following a process initiated by my Department, these additional places are now being provided through the Psychological Society of Ireland's postgraduate diploma course.</P>

The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced in last year's budget, I intend to increase the payment for qualified adults aged 66 or over to the same level as the personal rate of the old age (non-contributory) pension. This process commenced in budget 2001 with special increases of &euro;19.05 granted. In budget 2002 increases of up to &euro;12.70 were granted to qualified adults over 66 years of age. The measure is intended to improve the position of women who do not qualify for a pension in their own right.</P>
      <P>In general, a QAA is paid at a lower rate than the personal rate. However, in the case of some reduced rate contributory pensions not including pre-53 or over-56 self employed pensions, the QAA was actually being paid at a higher rate than that being paid in respect of the pensioner. In these cases, the personal rate is reduced to reflect the average level of contributions paid but the full rate QAA was being paid.</P>
      <P>I recognised that the proposals announced in budget 2001 would worsen this anomaly and, accordingly, I introduced measures in the Social Welfare Act, 2001, to deal with the situation. From April 2001 the QAA payments in all new cases have reflected the rate at which pensions are awarded. For instance, when a person is awarded a pension at half the full personal rate the qualified adult is also paid at half the full QAA rate.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of half rate old age contributory pension applicable to those with a yearly average of ten to 14 contributions. The rate of QAA which would have applied from April 2001 is &euro;50.54 or 50% of the full QAA. However, in order that there would be no reduction in the rate payable, it was decided to slow down the rate of increase for people already in receipt of reduced rate pensions. In the case of the person concerned, the QAA was increased by &euro;10.16 resulting in a payment of &euro;92.20 instead of &euro;50.54. Budget 2002 increased the QAA to &euro;98.50 in this case.</P>
      <P>I consider that this measure represents a sympathetic solution to the removal of the anomaly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 22 November 2001. One of the principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and being provided.</P>
      <P>The medical evidence submitted with the application was insufficient to determine whether the person being cared for required full-time care and attention and a more comprehensive medical report was requested from the care recipient's doctor.</P>
      <P>This report was referred to the Department's medical adviser. In the light of the evidence and the opinion of the medical adviser, the application was refused on the basis that full-time care and attention was not required. The person concerned was notified of this decision and of her right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office on 11 January 2002.</P>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. Details of grants awarded in 2001 and the number of ben<Col N="181" /> eficiaries of the scheme last year are currently being compiled and will be made available in the coming weeks. Some &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002. Voluntary or community based groups seeking funding under the scheme of community support for older people must satisfy the defined eligibility criteria of the scheme, comply with Government tax clearance procedures and provide satisfactory accounts in respect of previously paid grants.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that this scheme continues to operate in a way that benefits the most vulnerable older people in our society. With this in mind my Department keeps the administrative procedures applying to the scheme under review and makes amendments as appropriate. My Department also monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis to ensure that those organisations receiving funding under the scheme are complying with all the scheme regulations and requirements.</P>
      <P>The organisation mentioned in the Deputy's question is one of the voluntary organisations which has submitted applications for funding to my Department in recent years. While every effort is made to ensure the prompt processing of applications under the scheme, my Department, in administering this and other grant schemes funded from public money, must ensure that all criteria are adhered to, including the provision by funded groups of satisfactory accounts in respect of previously issued grants.</P>
      <P>An application for funding was received from this organisation in 2000 and again in 2001. However, as satisfactory accounts were not submitted to my Department in respect of the grant issued in 1999, it was not possible to process the application further. My Department has been engaged in lengthy correspondence with the group on this matter and recently received accounts and other documentation which are currently under consideration. Representatives from my Department met with the organisation recently to discuss outstanding issues relating to their application. As a result of that meeting my Department is reviewing the application and additional information provided by the organisation. My Department hopes to resolve this situation shortly and will be in touch with the organisation in due course.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme of community support for older people, the maximum grant available is 90% of the once-off costs of purchasing and installing the necessary security equipment. However, the actual level of funding made available for individual applications varies according to individual needs and circumstances and according to the overall demand to be met in relation to the available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to assess all applications at the same time so that an appropriate level of funding can be determined for each application, taking into account the need to target funding at those most in need of assistance under the scheme. In order to facilitate this process it is necessary to have one closing date for receipt of applications <Col N="182" /> so that an accurate assessment of the total number of applications received and the level of funding sought can be made.</P>
    <P>However, while a closing date for receipt of applications is applied each year, the regional offices of my Department are flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are no direct incentives available from my Department to develop facilities such as tourist amenities on the islands, my Department has, since 1997, invested in the region of &euro;23 million in the improvement of island infrastructure and transport services. While this investment is aimed primarily at improving the living conditions of island dwellers, it has also helped to improve the climate for economic development on the islands including the development of the tourism industry. Among the types of projects which have been grant aided since 1997 are:</P>
      <P>&ndash;almost &euro;1.9m to provide-improve electricity supply on 18 offshore islands; </P>
      <P>&ndash;over &euro;2.7m spent on works on piers serving six islands off the Cork coast;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&euro;1.27m to construct a new bridge to Inishnee in County Galway;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&euro;290,000 to set up a waste recycling scheme on the Aran Islands;</P>
      <P>&ndash;a grant of &euro;1.84m approved for Mayo County Council to provide a cable car between the mainland and Inishbiggle at Bullsmouth;</P>
      <P>&ndash;almost &euro;3.5m to carry out major improvement works on the harbour facilities at Léab Gharbh on Arranmore Island and at Machaire Rabhartaigh on the mainland serving Tory Island and Inishbofin; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&euro;930,000 for the construction of a sea wall on Tory Island.</P>
      <P>One of the priorities for islanders is the improvement of island access through the improvement of ferry and air services. With this in mind my Department now subsidises 16 different services providing transport to 12 islands. This compares to only four islands which were served by State assisted services in 1997. The services currently assisted include:</P>
      <P>&ndash;a passenger and freight ferry service from Galway to the Aran Islands;</P>
      <P>&ndash;a daily passenger ferry service between Inis Mór, Árainn and Ros a'Mhíl, and Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr and Ros a'Mhíl;</P>
      <P>&ndash;ferry services between Inishbofin, Inishturk and Clare Island and the mainland; </P>
      <P>&ndash;a ferry service between Cape Clear Island and the mainland;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;ferry services between Sherkin, Whiddy, <Col N="184" /> Bere, Long and Heir Islands and the mainland;</P>
    <P>&ndash;ferry services between Tory and Arranmore Islands and the mainland; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;an air service between the Aran Islands and the mainland.</P>
    <P>I should also point out to the Deputy that Údarás na Gaeltachta's strategic approach to the development of tourism in the Gaeltacht, which includes the Gaeltacht islands, is outlined in pages 30 to 35 of its 2000 annual report which was published recently and that it has assisted projects on various islands in the form of grant aid and shares. Assistance is also normally available from the Údarás for other projects which have a tourism aspect such as arts and crafts projects, heritage centres etc.</P>

      <P>The report referred to in the Deputy's question was published by GRECO in December 2001. It follows on an evaluation by a team from GRECO, which is a committee operating under the auspices of the Council of Europe, having a particular focus on the phenomenon of corruption. The evaluation report centred on the response of a number of Departments and agencies concerning the prevention and detection of corruption, including my own Department, the Departments of Finance and Environment and Local Government, the Garda Síochána, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Office of the Civil Service and Local <Col N="185" /> Appointments Commissioners. As such, it is a wide-ranging report.</P>
      <P>The report is generally favourable to Ireland. It concludes that &ldquo;Ireland appears to belong to the group of those GRECO members that are least affected by corruption.&rdquo;  GRECO also welcomed the proposals contained in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2001, which update the law on corruption and make it more responsive to modern conditions.</P>
      <P>As already mentioned, the report covers the response of a number of Departments and agencies in detecting and preventing corruption. Therefore the recommendations are not a matter for my Department alone. My Department and the other relevant Departments and agencies will examine the recommendations before deciding on the necessary action to be taken in response.</P>

    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the most recent statistics readily available in relation to personnel attached to divisional drugs units, as of 9 October 2001, are as follows. In addition, the Garda National Drugs Unit, headed by a detective chief superintendent, consisted of 52 personnel. All members of the Garda Síochána are tasked with the responsibility of enforcing the relevant legislation and, in addition, substantial resources are employed on specialised Garda projects and operations.</P>

      <P>The position in so far as future legislation in relation to the abolition of ground rents is concerned, is that the Government's current legislation programme makes provision for such a Bill. The content of the proposed Bill continues to be examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office and the Land Registry, since it raises certain constitutional, technical and practical difficulties. I hope these difficulties can be overcome in a way that would improve on the readily available and reasonable system that already exists for the purchase of ground rents, and that details of the proposed legislation can be announced in the early part of this year.</P>

      <P>As this primary school does not yet have access to the full service provided by the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, it is entitled to avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. I announced funding for this initiative last June. It allows schools which do not yet have access to the NEPS service to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. The number of assessments per school is determined by the number of pupils, to a maximum of two per 100 pupils enrolled.</P>
      <P>This school has a population of almost 500 pupils, and is entitled to commission ten assessments under the scheme. The school has arranged two psychological assessments so far and it is entitled to commission eight more. It is a matter for the principal of the school to approach a psychologist to carry out the assessments. If there is a difficulty about waiting times, the principal may approach any psychologist on the NEPS panel. There are approximately 90 psychologists on the panel and their names are available from my Department's website.</P>

      <P>A comparative study of the levels of speaking and listening skills in Irish was carried out by Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann on pupils in second class in a national sample of primary schools in 1982. The sample included schools in the Gaeltacht, all-Irish schools outside the Gaeltacht and other national schools. A more limited comparison of the levels of listening and speaking skills in Irish of pupils in fourth class in a national sample of schools skills was carried out by Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann in 1980. The results of these surveys were published by Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann in 1984 in Spoken Irish in Primary Schools by John Harris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985 a national sample of primary schools, including Gaeltacht schools, all-Irish schools outside the Gaeltacht and other schools was used by Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann to carry out a comparative study of the levels of listening and <Col N="190" /> speaking skills in Irish among pupils in sixth class. The results of this study were published in an article in the international journal <i>Language, Culture and Curriculum</i> and in a chapter by John Harris and Lelia Murtagh in a book entitled, <i>Third International Conference on Minority Languages: Celtic Papers</i> edited by McEoin, G., Alqvist, A. and Ó hAodha, D. (1987). These studies show that children in Gaeltacht schools and in all-Irish schools generally have substantially higher levels of receptive and expressive skills in Irish than their counterparts in other schools.</P>
    <P>Studies of various aspects of the teaching and learning of Irish by Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann have continued since these national surveys of the 1980s and this more recent work is summarised in a major report, Teaching and Learning Irish in Primary School, by John Harris and Lelia Murtagh published in 1999. One of the major findings of this work is that children have significantly higher levels of achievement in listening to and speaking Irish in schools and classes where the focus is more on communication than on traditional language practice and memorisation.</P>
    <P>The Educational Research Centre and Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann are preparing jointly to carry out a survey of achievement in the Irish language at sixth class in primary schools towards the end of the current school year. The survey will assess speaking, listening and reading skills. It will be carried out in a representative sample of schools, including Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools outside the Gaeltacht as well as other schools. It will allow comparisons between current standards of Irish and those that obtained in the 1980s. It will also provide a baseline for measuring any changes that occur after teachers begin to implement the revised curriculum. The research work done on teaching and learning Irish provides valuable insights into the complex process of language learning and language development. I am committed to doing all that is necessary to ensure that our pupils' experience of learning and of using Irish is positive and successful.</P>
    <P>The recently revised primary curriculum is designed to cater for the language learning and development needs of all pupils, whether they attend Gaeltacht, all-Irish or other schools and whether their mother tongue is Irish or English. Last December I announced the setting up of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta. Its work will support the teaching of Irish in Gaeltacht schools, all-Irish schools and in other schools and will also support the provision of education through Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. The report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next 15 years. As regards training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places for both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and an additional 25 training places in physiotherapy. These increases are in addition to the extra number of places provided by the colleges in the last academic year in response to the request to expand provision in the light of perceived shortages.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency working group has been established, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. The Higher Education Authority has sought proposals from third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes, in response to the training needs identified in the report. The proposals received are currently being considered.</P>
      <P>As regards clinical psychology, I understand that a joint review group on psychology services has identified a shortage of professionally qualified clinical psychologists. This review group comprised representatives of the Health Services Employers Agency, health service employers, the Department of Health and Children and IMPACT. I further understand that the Department of Health and Children has made arrangements with the Psychology Society of Ireland to provide 30 additional postgraduate training places in 2001-02. The Higher Education Authority has recently received a request for capital funding from NUI Galway for the development of a postgraduate course in clinical psychology. The authority is currently considering this request in consultation with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards educational psychology, the <Col N="195" /> National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is undertaking a joint survey with the principal psychologists in Northern Ireland of supply and demand of educational psychologists in the island of Ireland. I am awaiting completion of that survey along with its report and recommendations. In the interim, my Department and the Higher Education Authority have agreed to a proposal to increase the annual output from the MA in educational psychology at University College Dublin from six to ten. I understand the Higher Education Authority has not received any proposal in relation to educational psychology from NUI Galway.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of mandatory Irish language modules in these courses, the position is that the curriculum content is a matter in the first instance for the individual educational institution and the appropriate professional body. As regards the delivery of educational psychology services, NEPS has advised me that it is working, through a number of measures, to ensure that a psychological service is available through the medium of Irish for those who require it.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern expressed by school authorities referred to by the Deputy. At primary level, schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools, including insurance costs. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from £45 per pupil in 1997 to £80, &euro;101.58, per pupil in this school year. In addition, a further increase of &euro;10 per pupil will apply from September 2002. This constitutes an increase of 95% over that period and is a reflection of the <Col N="198" /> Government's commitment to improve funding to the education sector. In the case of a 400 pupil school this capitation grant amounts to &euro;44,632 each year.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita</i> grants may be used for this purpose. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September 2000 to £192 and by £10 from September 2001 to £202, &euro;256.49. The rate will be increased by a further &euro;10 to &euro;266.49 from September 2002. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra &euro;20,870 per annum and a total capitation grant of &euro;133,245 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.10 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to &euro;152,295.</P>

      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question on 30 September 2000 was 156 pupils. An enrolment of 156 pupils warrants the staffing of a principal and five mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has the services of a remedial teacher and a resource teacher for Travellers.</P>
      <P>Last year I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three year period and will cost &euro;33 million. The programme involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school in question has been included in the rural dimension of the new programme. The school is eligible to receive grant aid of &euro;1,027 in <Col N="199" /> respect of the 2001-02 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. Rural schools identified by the Educational Research Centre as having the highest concentration of disadvantaged pupils will be allocated the services of a co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. The school in question was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
    <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my <Col N="200" /> Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools. My Department has now received a report from the Educational Research Centre and the situation of those schools that made representations is currently under consideration. There is no record of representations having been received from the school until recently and, accordingly, the position of the school was not considered. However, the circumstances of the school may fall to be considered again in the context of any future modifications to the programme.</P>
