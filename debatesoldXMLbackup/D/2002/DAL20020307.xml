      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputies Flanagan, Rabbitte and Fitzgerald. I call firstly on Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise under Standing Order 31 the urgent and important matter of the adverse consequences, trauma and hardship inflicted on thousands of families throughout the State arising from the most recent round of job cuts and redundancies and the need for the Government to formulate an appropriate plan of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give notice of my intention to seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the alarming growth in the rate of job losses which has seen the live register grow by more than 165 per day over the past four months; its likely increase at an even greater rate due to the announcement of job losses in the past week, including 375 at the former Irish Glass Bottle Company at Ringsend, 300 at Flextronics in Tullamore, 200 at Youghal Carpets, 160 at EMC, Ovens, and 80 at SMTC Electronics, and the urgent need for Government action to save these jobs or secure alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely the proposed closure of the Ardagh glass bottle plant in Ringsend with the loss of up to 375 jobs, the serious consequences for the people employed there, the impact on the Ringsend community, the major repercussions for the recycling industry and the <Col N="218" /> consequent impact on the environment due to loss of this major facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully, I do not consider it to be in accordance with Standing Order 31. However, in the event of Private Notice Questions, the matter will receive further consideration. In regard to the second topic, I received notice from Deputies Allen and Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that the Dáil adjourn under Standing Order 31 to allow the Taoiseach to make a statement on awarding a contract to manage the 50 metre pool, which is part of the Abbotstown project, and to allow a subsequent debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to allow debate to take place to establish why the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Tánaiste, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, appear to be in the dark as to the manner in which a contract was awarded to build an aquatic centre at Abbotstown in which the Government is reportedly investing more than &euro;62 million, and to have the Taoiseach make a full statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 19, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a proposal regarding section 17A of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, back from Committee; No. 20, motion re referral to Joint Committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a proposal to the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is a proposal for a council framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings; No. 21, motion re Standing Order 92A; No. 50, Finance Bill, 2002, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 22, motion re suspension of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to be taken not later than immediately following the conclusion of No. 50.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am saying it is unacceptable to us on the basis that we are being asked to abandon our responsibility as an Opposition party because the Taoiseach wants to run away. The Government is hiding. It is not prepared to sit the number of days we would normally sit in March. There is no need for the <Col N="220" /> House to adjourn until 20 March, and the Labour Party will not voluntarily acquiesce to the dereliction of our duty in holding this failed Government to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision for Government time in the debate on the motion on Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. Was it the Taoiseach's intention that the Government would not participate in the debate on No. 22? There is provision for Deputy O'Keeffe and Fine Gael and Labour Members to speak, but not for Government Members. I would have thought that at least the chairperson of the Members' interests committee, Deputy Killeen, would propose the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is being guillotined without the consent of the Labour Party. We are opposed to the guillotine.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the fourth proposal, the proposal dealing with Private Members' Business, agreed to? Agreed. Is the fifth proposal, the proposal dealing with No. 22, motion re suspension of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir. The House has agreed that an ethical code be established for Members and that sanctions be applied to those who breach it. The Committee on Members Interests has recommended, by way of motion, that Deputy Ned O'Keeffe be suspended for ten days. It seems, given that the House has established a code of ethics and imposed sanctions, that we should impose them in the full light of day. If we are to be strong enough to sanction Members and, like other professions, self-regulating, we should not try to hide the matter in the middle of the night. This item should be taken after the Order of Business, not at about 10.25 p.m. when it will receive no attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to this matter. I agree with Deputy Noonan and we are inviting the public to be cynical about the manner in which we purport to carry out business in this House. On many occasions the Taoiseach has admitted that politics has been brought into disrepute by the actions of many members, or former members, of his party. He has attempted to claim credit for the establishment of the tribunals which, in many cases, were forced upon a reluctant Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true. We are cynically being asked to acquiesce to Fianna Fáil getting Report Stage of the Finance Bill, which is being guillotined, through the House before taking away the vote of a Member. Deputy Noonan is correct to state that we should deal with this item now. The matter was raised at the Whips' meetings and we are doing no service to any Member by acquiescing to this measure. That is why the Labour Party is opposed to this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to find out why we are not taking this matter now, but no reason has been given. This proposal appears to be a cynical exercise to allow the Government to get Report and Final Stages of the Finance Bill through the House. I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to ensure that this House is spared whatever cynicism is possible and that this item is dealt with expeditiously. The matter has been well publicised and I am sure the public is wondering why it has to be put off until late this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anyone could suggest that this proposal has anything to do with a close vote on the Finance Bill. We have just seen what is the vote. I have listed the matter concerning Deputy Ned O'Keeffe for the order for today and the Deputy will speak on the matter. However, the Finance Bill is one of the most important Bills of the year and takes precedence. The other matter will be dealt with today and a tough sentence will be imposed on the Deputy. The matter can be debated during the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow, one of the listed items to be guillotined is Second Stage of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001. On 19 February the Government announced the appointment and naming of three distinguished people to be appointed judges to assist in the Flood tribunal. Since the announcement, those individuals have ceased practising while waiting to be appointed as judges which requires an amendment to the Courts Bill. The Courts Bill, in my name, is No. 77 on today's Order Paper. Will the Government consider a proposal I made and accept a simple one line amendment to that Bill to increase the number of Circuit Court judges by three? All sides of the House could accept that by agreement and the three judges could be appointed tomorrow to take up the important work of the tribunal. That would allow us then to deal expeditiously with the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001. This is complicated legislation which has important amendments with which we could deal on the understanding that we would conclude the Bill by the end of this Dáil.</P>

We can let the judges be appointed to the Flood tribunal and then proceed with the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always regarded this Administration as one of the most incompetent we have ever had. This is principally due to the fact that instead of doing their jobs in the Departments, everybody from the Taoiseach down is opening pubs and off-licences around the country and nobody seems to be accountable. Against that background, how did it come about that a dormant shelf company with assets of £4 sterling has received the contract for running the aquatic centre attached to Campus Stadium Ireland? The Tánaiste says that she does not know how a shelf company with no track record could have succeeded in a contract such as this and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation says that he does not know how it happened either. Who is in charge? Who actually runs Departments now? Who is accountable and answerable to this House when fiascos such as this occur? Since the buck should stop at the Taoiseach's desk, will he inform the House what he knows about this? What is happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Taoiseach is the person responsible for this. Does he intend to make a comprehensive and detailed statement on the matter? He must be well prepared as this issue could have been anticipated. Does the Taoiseach not agree that the project was brought into disrepute by avoiding or by-passing all the normal procedures of due diligence within the Government? There was no memorandum to the Department of Finance. The matter was brought straight to Cabinet and there was no examination of the proposal. A company to which the Taoiseach was personally close was given the contract to operate and manage this project. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation was excluded from the process from the beginning. Look at him now &ndash; he is as far away as he could possibly be.</P>

This is a serious matter and the Taoiseach must explain, considering the amount of money involved, how a contract which has caused so much concern to other members of the Cabinet, including the <Col N="229" /> Tánaiste, has been awarded. Perhaps she has a view about what is happening and perhaps the House, the Members of which will be required to vote for the allocation of moneys to this project, will be told what is going on.

      <P>Following queries from <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday and a subsequent article in yesterday's paper about the awarding of the operating contract for the aquatic leisure centre at Abbotstown, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation requested that the contract awarding authority of Campus Stadium Ireland provide, as a matter of urgency, a comprehensive report on issues raised in the article. These are the issues raised by Deputies Noonan and Quinn. The Minister was provided with a response late last night and has now sought further clarification from Campus Stadium Ireland on a number of issues as a matter of urgency. Until that clarification is obtained from the company and considered I can make no further comment about the matter. The Minister has also recommended to the executive chairman of the company that a meeting of the board should be held immediately so that members have an opportunity to discuss the issue in detail. The Government will also investigate the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been aware of this for about three days now. Members are entitled to an answer which we are not receiving this morning. Who was responsible for scrutinising the tenders? Was it done by the chief executive of Campus Stadium Ireland or by the board? What consultation took place with the parent Department? What was the involvement of the Minister? Was a report made to Cabinet about the award of this contract? Since it is the Taoiseach's pet project, I presume a report was made to him and that he was at least informed of what was happening. Did he sign off on this contract himself, as the main proponent of this increasingly white white elephant?</P>

The discussions of the board gave rise to the Minister's request for an examination of the issue and an early board meeting. The Minister will be glad to make public the results of that meeting.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned about the collapse in confidence within the Irish economy among ordinary workers who are now faced with the reality that the jobs they thought were secure are manifestly insecure? Does he share with me the anger expressed by so many workers who lost their jobs in Tullamore and who no longer feel that their interests are being looked after by this Government? Earlier today my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, tried to raise the issue under Standing Order 31. The reality is that over the past four months, 20,000 people have signed on to the live register. As we sit here, 165 people are signing on to the live register, 165 people a day who have lost their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>What action, if any, will the Taoiseach take? In the glass bottle company in Ringsend, 375 jobs have been lost. Some 300 jobs have been lost in Tullamore, 200 jobs have been lost at Youghal Carpets and 160 jobs have been lost at EMC in Ovens. Across the country, jobs are being lost systematically.</P>
      <P>What has gone wrong over the past four years? The Government was handed the economy in extremely good condition with a budget surplus. We now find that the accounts are in the red, the tax revenues are below the anticipated level and workers are losing their jobs. There is no sense of protection or urgency. What message can the Taoiseach give to the workers who have lost their jobs and the others who will lose their jobs in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The job losses over the past four months or so are the highest for over five years. When the numbers are added up they are achieving record levels. The inward flow of investment to supply replacement jobs has also dried up and <Col N="231" /> international confidence in the Government's management of the economy is now very low. This is because a budget which was brought in in December is already off the rails, expenditure which was projected to rise at 11% is rising at 22%, and in the first two months of this year alone, the fiscal account is in deficit by more than £1.25 billion. I ask in particular whether the Taoiseach has discussed this situation with the Tánaiste. Has the Tánaiste confirmed that the flow of inward investment has dried up and that the prospect of new jobs through foreign investment in manufacturing industry is a very poor prospect for the remainder of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Quinn's concern for the plight of the individuals concerned, whether in Youghal Carpets, Flextronics or in other companies. I hope industrial relations mechanisms will help to sort out the problems at some of those companies. However, in other companies it is market conditions that are unfortunately creating the difficulties. While in some cases jobs in the existing workforce will be maintained, it is clear that quite a number will lose their jobs. As always, the State agencies and the various Departments will do all they can, both for existing companies and communities, and will assist as they have successfully done in a number of cases. The record of the Tánaiste in helping these areas to recover quickly through task forces and other methods has been extremely successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 50,000 new jobs were created last year in this economy. Employment grew by almost 3% last year. The latest survey shows that Ireland has for the first time ever reached the target of 1.75 million jobs. The latest figures from the CSO, the ESRI and others show that the economy is doing well. As I understand it, last week the live register fell. However, there have been job losses and we need to work ourselves through what has been a difficult international period, and continue to work successfully with the IDA and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say there has not been good inward investment in this country, in so far as there is investment moving anywhere around the world. Biotechnology plants are one of the biggest areas for inward investment. The IDA <Col N="232" /> continues to follow up some of the other big operations around the world in that area, and that is also the case for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry. We are doing remarkably well during a difficult period and must continue to do that. We must continue to try, where we regrettably lose jobs, to do all that we can to get replacement industries, to continue the flow of inward investment and to maintain our excellent economy in as good health as we possibly can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this Government, despite taking the credit for the boom, does not have control over international market forces. I accept that its wonderful powers of spinning are limited and that there are some things over which it does not have control. However, the Government has control over other things. It has control over the 1967 redundancy legislation and the social insurance fund, when it is not being raided by the Minister for Finance. It could ease the plight of the 165 workers who will lose their jobs today, or who lost their jobs yesterday, or the 20,000 who have lost their jobs, such as the workers at Peerless Rugs in Athy and it could update the legislation for statutory redundancy payments to bring them from a half weeks pay for every year served up to the level of the recommendation from the Labour Court, and the demand now from congress, of three weeks pay per year served. That would get rid of the 41-year old sexist discrimination. The Tánaiste gave some indication or made some promise to the effect that this would be done because many of the firms that have gone into liquidation are not empowered to implement the Labour Court recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach expressed concern for the individuals who have lost their jobs. Many of those workers, because of their educational background and work experience, will not be eligible to take up the new jobs that will come into this economy because of its changing nature. I ask the Taoiseach to do the following things over which he has total control, and which are not subject to market forces or the recession following 11 September of last year. Will he and the Tánaiste bring in emergency legislation to at least give those who have lost their jobs some decent cushion through redundancy payments from the insurance fund that they have paid into? This will not cause any additional increase in taxation and will give those people a cushion of money that will enable them to look for other jobs or to avail of the retraining opportunities which FÁS can offer them. The Taoiseach could do that. This side of the House will agree to a single Bill to change those terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to recognise that many middle income taxpayers still pay more income tax than their counterparts in the United Kingdom. The Minister admitted this on Committee Stage. Over the past seven or eight years, a great deal of progress has been made in reducing income tax but the people who have gained most are those at the top of the scale who earn more than £100,000 and the 7% of the workforce who earn more than £200,000. I estimate that those earning over £200,000 have gained £60,000 to £70,000 from tax reductions under the Government. It may be argued that was because they were paying far too much tax in the first place, and there is some truth in that. A great deal of progress has been made <Col N="239" /> with those who earn the least and the tax take on lower incomes here is significantly lower than it is in the United Kingdom &ndash; that was not always the case.</P>
      <P>These amendments seek to extend that favourable comparison to workers in the middle incomes who pay higher income tax than those in the UK. The Minister has heard us make this argument in recent years. I raised it on Committee and Report Stages of last year's Finance Act. I realise that Exchequer finances have taken a sharp turn for the worst in the past year. The Minister would like us to believe that is solely down to foot and mouth disease and the events of 11 September. By far the largest cause is the Minister allowing current expenditure to increase by 22% when income increased by only 4%. The figures for the first two months of this year were published last week and they reveal a further increase of 22%.</P>
      <P>The real problem for the Exchequer is the failure of the Government to confine gross and public expenditure to a realistic and tolerable level. If that had been done the Government would have been able to take some steps to alleviate the tax burden on middle income earners. As I said on Committee Stage, a significant percentage in that category are young people who are incurring the costs of setting up a home. We have a generation of young people who have not been more prosperous or better paid than they are now, but they are the first generation for a long time who have no prospect of buying their own homes in their own city, and that is a pity. This also affects Irish exiles who are very talented, well educated, have good experience and want to return home. They cannot return home because they would have to pay more tax at middle incomes, nor would they be able to afford to purchase homes.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to acknowledge, as he did on Committee Stage, that there are significant numbers on middle incomes paying more income tax than those in the UK. I also ask him to agree in principle that we should aim to eliminate this disadvantage as soon as is feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>The points outlined by Deputy Jim Mitchell are crucial. The point at which people reach the top rate of income tax is too low &ndash;&euro;28,000 is quite a low level at which to enter the 42% income tax band. This amendment tries to increase the level at which one enters the top tax band. Many ordinary workers in ordinary jobs, of which many are single income families, find that it is very difficult to survive on an income of &euro;25,000 to &euro;28,000. They must pay for everything. Generally, they do not qualify for higher education grants and if their children go to college it will cost them an arm and a leg. If they are single parents they may reach the top tax band at a slightly higher level. Nonetheless, we need to increase the level at which ordinary people begin paying the higher rate of income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" />There are approximately 1.7 million people in the workforce and of those, approximately 32% earn less than &euro;10,000. The Minister will be correct in telling us that many of those are part-time workers, nonetheless it is a high proportion. Approximately 62% of the workforce earn less than £22,000. That is a huge proportion. If one were to examine what the Minister has done for that group, one would find that their income has not changed dramatically during his period of office. In that period there was a buoyant economy and some changes were made. Those with incomes in excess of &euro;60,000 have gained the most. Those in that category have received a tax payback of approximately &euro;1 billion during the Minister's period of office. That is a colossal amount of money to give to people who are already very well off. Those earning &euro;60,000 or more may find it difficult to survive, but they are doing well. How can the Minister justify giving a tax payback of those proportions to that relatively small group of people while not being able to take those on the minimum wage out of the tax net?</P>
    <P>It is all about what priorities the Government establishes when it designs the budget, tax bands and rates. The Government's record shows that the priorities it established have been geared towards the better off. The proportion of tax repayments skewed towards the better off is very high and that is disappointing. The Acting Chairman is a decent man and has represented a Dublin constituency for a very long time. If one considers any of our constituencies, regardless of whether they are affluent, the vast majority of people live ordinary lives and earn ordinary incomes. We should be looking after them. This proposal is an attempt to take some in the middle income band out of the top tax rate and have a lower 30% rate. It makes sense and I hope the Minister will change his mind. He was vehemently opposed to it on Committee Stage, but, perhaps, he will surprise us by accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the problem was that I always surprised  people. The purpose of these amendments is to provide for a third, 30%, band of tax between the standard rate of 20% and the higher rate of 42%. As I stated on the many occasions that this was debated, I have been engaged on a radical reform of the tax system in my tenure as the Minister for Finance. Tax credits were introduced and increased, tax rates substantially reduced, and there was significant widening of the standard rate band. All these made the tax system inherently fairer, improved the incentive to work and contributed to economic development. In particular, the changes in tax bands and credits have considerably benefited those on lower incomes, more than 380,000 of whom have been removed from the tax net altogether since I took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" />When this was discussed by the Select Committee last week, Deputy Jim Mitchell suggested that his and Deputy McGrath's amendment would assist those on middle incomes. Regardless of what may constitute a middle income, the focus of the Government's actions in the past five years was on reducing the tax burden for the large number of taxpayers earning below the threshold for the middle rate of &euro;43,000 proposed by the Deputies. The Government's target, endorsed by the social partners in the PPF, is to move over time to a position where this 80% of taxpayers pays tax at no more than the standard rate. For the present year, the Revenue Commissioners estimate that close to 80% of taxpayers will earn less than &euro;40,000, approximately £31,500. These are the people whom the Government has targeted in its tax reforms.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed in principle to a third rate, but it should only be considered when the present process of reform is completed. At present, the proposal would mean an effective cut of 12% of higher rate taxpayers at a time when greater prudence in managing the overall Government finances is called for. The proposal would cost &euro;750 million in a full year, more than the entire income tax package in the 2002 budget.</P>
    <P>Internationally, we are ahead of the field in terms of the tax burden imposed on those who might be regarded as being on middle to low incomes. According to OECD data, a single person on the average production or industrial wage in Ireland has the lowest tax rate in the European Union. The EU's average tax rate is 45% while Ireland's figure in 28.8%. Provisional data from the EU shows that EU average tax rate for 2000 of a single low paid person on 50% of the average production wage, APW, is 35%, while Ireland's tax rate on that income is 14.8%. For a married couple on 50% of the APW, the tax rate here is 30.8% while the EU average is 32.2%. At incomes of up to &euro;30,000 for single persons and &euro;50,000 for married persons, people are better off in Ireland than the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The approach to tax reforms comes down to judgment and I have said often that I would be happy to be judged on the combined effects of the five budgets for which I was responsible. Each one must be taken as part of a sequence. My tax strategy is bearing fruit in terms of higher take-home pay and increased incentive to work. I am confident the considered judgment of the electorate in this regard will be favourable when the general election is held. It is not possible to do everything at once. I would be prepared to consider the question of a middle rate in a future budget and, consequently, I cannot accept the Deputies' amendments.</P>
    <P>I am not against the idea of this or other rates in principle, as I stated, but I set out a programme while in opposition which I pursued in Government with additions. It was not in the election manifestos of either Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, or in the original action programme for the millennium, to remove people on <Col N="242" /> the minimum wage, because there was no minimum wage. That wage was a Fianna Fáil policy which I announced on the party's behalf while in opposition.</P>
    <P>That the minimum wage was my idea will cause terrible trauma to my critics in the media and others. I announced it in the salubrious surroundings of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham long before that general election. This will be a problem for those who wish to portray me in a certain light and are reluctant to dispense with my reputation in this regard. It became part of our programme for Government which led to the establishment of the Minimum Wage Commission and then the minimum wage Act. In the PPF and the revised mid-term review of the plan for Government, the goal of removing people on the minimum wage was added. Therefore, as a result of this year's budget, people earning up to 90% of the minimum wage will be outside the tax net.</P>
    <P>I followed a deliberate approach to tax reform. Both publicly and privately in all my years in this House, I was critical of the fact that every Minister for Finance was forced by dint of circumstances and lobby groups into making only small changes in the tax system. They acted to please as many as they could with little effect. I adopted a deliberate policy of saying what I would do and did it over five budgets. I have almost completed this programme by putting the tax system on solid foundations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>No Minister nor any politician in this House could say that, but I adopted a way of going about this, and stated after each budget that my aim was to establish a tax system based on sound principles. I introduced tax credits, widened tax bands and eliminated many tax avoidance mechanisms. The system is simpler and fairer following these changes. I want to achieve a system in which a person does not come under the higher rate of taxation until he or she has a reasonable income, and I have been relatively successful in this.</P>
      <P>This has generated controversy at different times, because, to get to that outcome, some decisions had to be taken. I have almost completed my programme which incorporates reforming the complex PRSI system. I did part of this in the previous budget by eliminating some thresholds. It was my intention to do more this year but, unfortunately, I was unable to do so. If I started to make piecemeal changes, as I said to Deputy Noonan recently, then I would not achieve my ultimate goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone has benefited from my tax reforms. Various articles and reports, such as the OECD's, recognise this. Even the Irish media no longer accuses me of not doing much for the lower paid. Deputy Jim Mitchell obliged me with a parliamentary question in autumn, 2000, about comparing Irish and British take-home pay, which gave <Col N="243" /> me the opportunity to lay out my schedule. At that time, he was not Fine Gael's spokesperson on finance but my answer to that question silenced much criticism, even from the trades unions, as it showed that we were ahead of the United Kingdom regarding lower incomes. Deputies Jim Mitchell and McGrath are right in saying that above certain levels we are not as good as the United Kingdom, and I will give the figures on this.</P>
    <P>However, on lower and middle incomes, we are better than the rest of Europe, as has been commented on in European Union reports. After I announced this budget, an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> illustrated with graphs what I had done in my five years and said that the only criticism against me it was that I targeted the relief disproportionately at the lower paid. That is what the facts prove. Regarding the lower paid, we are way ahead of the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, but we cannot do everything at once.</P>
    <P>I will give the Deputy some of the UK figures. Combining tax and PRSI contributions in both countries, single people here earning up to almost &euro;40,000 and married couples earning up to almost &euro;70,000 are better off. I can give the Deputy the separate figures for tax and PRSI here and the figures for tax and national insurance contributions in the UK.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath made the point about taking off 12 percentage points. That would automatically favour the better off. Deputy McGrath referred also to people earning over &euro;60,000 and Deputy Mitchell referred to people earning over &euro;200,000. The Deputies made the point that these people would be getting too much, but their proposal would give them an even bigger break than they get now. Deputy Mitchell spoke about the disproportional share of budget concessions going to these high earners, but my statistician tells me that people earning over &euro;200,000 make up only 1% of total numbers.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tim Callan of the ESRI wrote an article in the ESRI quarterly document on the distributive impact of budget 2002, which was carried in some of the national newspapers. Using what is known as the Switch model, it stated that compared to other budgets over the past 15 years, which would incorporate Members from different parties in this House, this budget was the most socially progressive budget. I have given those figures previously.</P>

      <P>Yes, and the Minister did so for noble reasons, which are to his credit. When I was a Minister I highlighted the overall impact of tax on income compared to social welfare payments which left many people better off out of work than in work, but that was always denied. When I was Minister for Transport I remember being approached by the personnel manager in Aer Lingus, who also happened to be the chairman of the institute of personnel management, and he made a speech highlighting the problems of replacement ratios. I asked him to come in to meet me and he produced tables which matched my everyday experience. I got agreement from the Government to discuss this matter with the Department of Social Welfare, which denied that anyone could be better off out of work than in work. The experience in my constituency was of people leaving jobs because of the impact of tax on their income compared to social welfare.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that, and I know it is a difficult thing to do, but the tax changes generally have also been in the right direction.</P>
      <P>There is also the aspect of internal replacement ratio issues and the question of competition, which should be our first guiding light in everything we do about the economy. The people we are highlighting in these amendments are the only remaining group who are worse off under our tax code than the UK tax code. Accepting these amendments would be the last step in ensuring that people are not penalised for going to work, especially those with children, and are not worse off than those in other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the principle of a third rate, something we are keen to pursue if we are in Government in the next few weeks. I acknowledge the Minister has taken many good steps in this direction under the tax code but he had a very favourable Exchequer position in which to do that. Any Minister in that position would have been able to do a great deal, although perhaps not with the flair of this Minister. If current expenditure continues to escalate at 22%, he will soon have to get rid of the low <Col N="245" /> tax rates that have been introduced. He cannot have a high spend, low tax regime. They are mutually contradictory and if something is not done to stop the significant growth in current public expenditure or bring it back down to reasonable levels, his successors will be forced to pay the bills by raising taxes. I am completely against that because it is self-evident that a low tax regime has served this country well.</P>

      <P>This amendment goes directly to the question of individualisation and its effects. I acknowledge arguments can be made on both sides of the issue, but I had a telephone call about three weeks ago from a gentleman in Mullingar, which Deputy McGrath represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was there the other morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This gentleman said that his wife had lost her job recently and the result was that his weekly tax had increased. I told him that was the effect of individualisation. That telephone call encapsulated the issue. Is it right that where one spouse loses or has to give up his or her job for whatever reason and is at the loss of his or her income, the other spouse ends up paying more tax? Last year a one income couple paid £42 per week more in tax than a two income couple and that tax liability increased by a number of pounds in the budget.</P>
      <P>There are strong arguments for encouraging more women to enter the workforce for economic reasons. The argument against that is that there are intangible but significant social benefits to be gained if a mother can spend some years in the home with her children. I do not think anyone would argue against that. If a mother stays at home to work in the home and look after her children, she and her partner or spouse are penalised to the extent of paying close to £60 more in tax per week. How can that be right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer if individualisation was abolished and it was recognised that there is a cost in going to work. There is a modest PAYE allowance which causes irritation to the self-employed. In the interests of equity, I would prefer if a one income couple or a two income couple were to pay the same taxes and there was a going to work allowance in recognition of the cost of going to work. If the case were presented in that way, it <Col N="246" /> would be acceptable and reasonable to people, given that there are costs involved in going to work, including child care costs, travel costs, clothing costs and other intangible costs. What is the Minister's view on individualisation? Can he justify one income couples having to pay significantly more tax per week than two income couples? What is the social justification for that or is this a statement from the Minister that he has little regard for the work of the mother in the home?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the substance of the amendment in my name and the amendment in the names of the Fine Gael Deputies, I will deal with some of the issues we addressed <i>en passant</i> during the discussion on the first set of amendments. It will not surprise the Minister to hear that I am out of sympathy with much of the language that will be used during this debate. The assumption is that tax is necessarily a negative element. The inclination and the instinct is to think of it in exactly those terms, but we must go back to basics. The time is right for us to do that and to characterise tax for what it is, the money that is used for public investment by government on behalf of us all.</P>
      <P>We cannot and should not have a debate on tax in isolation. We have to form a view as a society as to what should be the appropriate level of public investment. The Minister compares us to the UK and to other European countries and says that because people's take home pay here is higher than that of people in the UK, that necessarily is good. I do not look at those figures in isolation, as the Minister well knows. I look at the level of public investment and the level of investment in services as compared between Ireland and other EU and OECD countries. I looked at figures in relation to that this morning. As the Minister also knows, those figures are very stark. They suggest that the level of public investment, even related to GNP, which is the fair measure in relation to Ireland, is a good deal lower than the EU average and compares only to the UK. My colleagues in the British Labour Party are bemoaning the fact that their level of public investment is as low as it is and they are finding difficulty in raising it without raising taxes. It will be interesting to see how matters develop in terms of the British budget which is coming up soon.</P>
      <P>As everybody would now acknowledge, the debate in the UK, which has comparable rates of tax to here, has moved on. There is now a much greater appreciation and willingness on the part of the public to acknowledge the self-evident fact that if taxes are reduced to the extent that they were in the UK in the 1980s and the early 1990s, the capacity of government to invest to the extent that is necessary &ndash; in the UK's case to maintain public services and in our case to develop public services to an acceptable rate in the first place &ndash; will be inhibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" />We talk about the way in which tax impacts on individuals, as if the only thing that matters in terms of quality of life is the amount of money in people's pockets, but that is not the only thing that matters to people in my constituency. It matters to them that even four or five years after they were promised they would be able to get the DART in Killester and Clontarf they cannot because the Government has not invested sufficiently to lengthen the number of carriages that can be put on to a train. It matters to them if they are left for four or five hours in the accident and emergency department of Beaumont Hospital. None of this can be reversed without using tax moneys for public investment, which we all know. That must be a constant part of this debate. We cannot deal with the tax argument in isolation. To that extent I come at it, as the Minister knows, from a different angle from him and perhaps some Fine Gael Deputies.</P>
    <P>Specifically on the individualisation issue, as the Minister knows, I opposed the individualisation of the standard rate band when it was introduced by the Minister a few years ago. From his perspective, he has taken this project a good deal down the road. There is a difference of some &euro;19,000 between the standard rate band of a single earner married couple and a double earner married couple. According to my reckoning, that means there is a difference in take home pay in the region of &euro;4,000 between a single earner married couple and a double earner married couple. Had the bands been simply doubled or if we had a situation where the bands were simply doubled and transferable, the tax take of the two types of couples would be roughly the same. Even when account is taken of the home carer's credit, the difference for someone who takes full benefit of the standard rate band is in excess of &euro;3,000. There is not a shadow of doubt that this change creates a great deal of resentment, particularly among people who, as Deputy Mitchell said, have gone from being a double earner couple to being a single earner couple. People usually make that transition to look after children and they are the people who are most resentful of the position in which they find themselves. They find that whereas their tax take would have been the same as a double earner couple a few years ago, their tax take now is different and not to their advantage. I said previously and, therefore, this will not come as a surprise to anyone, that I acknowledge that to reverse this will not be easy or cheap. It would be politically almost impossible to reverse it without equalising up. One could not in any realistic way equalise downwards. In terms of social commentary and taking into account where we started from, this is a retrograde move and one I continue to oppose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support this amendment. The Minister said on Committee Stage that his face was set in this direction and he would not go back on it. However, there are a few stark figures <Col N="248" /> that should be pointed out to him. I will quote from the Minister's tables published on budget day. The tax bill for a one income household which earns &euro;55,000 per annum is &euro;10,500 per annum. If the other spouse in that household were to go out to work, the State would give back that household almost &euro;4,000 in tax. Its tax liability on an income of &euro;55,000 per annum would be &euro;6,640 per annum. The household's tax liability would be further extended if the household had an income of &euro;56,000, the limit at which the Minister has given the double income allowance for a two earner couple.</P>
      <P>The big question we must ask is whether the Minister is saying to single income families that they are doing a disservice to the State, that they are a burden on the State and that they are not helping the State? Is he saying to them that the Government does not appreciate what they are doing and to show how dissatisfied it is with them, it will charge them an additional tax of about &euro;80 per week? That is the core of the issue. The Government has set its face against stay-at-home spouses who may want to raise their family or, for one reason or another, have decided not to go out into the workforce, and will penalise them to a huge extent to try to force them into the workforce. The number involved is not insignificant.</P>
      <P>The number of families in the PAYE sector last year who qualified for the home caring spouse allowance amounted to approximately 120,000. In addition, there is the self-employed sector, a proportion of whom would also qualify. Although the number involved is not insignificant, the Minister in his wisdom seems to be set against them. In effect, he is saying he does not appreciate their status, that they should do something else and he will charge them accordingly. That is not fair to stay-at-home spouses and those who, for whatever reason, do not wish to join the workforce. It is also anti-family, in that those who wish to rear their children, rather than put them in child care facilities, are penalised. That is not a good job. The Minister is overturning a trend that has developed here in the past number of years and I am saddened he is moving in that direction.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to justify how he can penalise a single income couple earning &euro;55,000 to the tune of approximately &euro;80 per week, as distinct from their neighbours who may be a double income couple on exactly the same income? </P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to commence the process of reversing the move towards an individual rate band structure for each taxpayer. However, as I indicated to the select committee, the amendments do not achieve that purpose; they merely maintain the difference in the higher income level at a significantly increased cost. This is because the increased standard rate band of &euro;19,000 for the two income married couple would remain in place thus providing, perhaps unwittingly, for a standard rate band structure of &euro;28,000 for a single person, the same as the budget proposal. That <Col N="249" /> is &euro;42,000 for a married single income couple and &euro;61,000 for a married double income couple under the proposals of Deputies Mitchell and McGrath, or &euro;40,000 and &euro;59,000 under Deputy McDowell's proposed amendment, compared to &euro;37,000 and &euro;66,000, under the Bill as published. This would also mean a married two income couple would have more than twice the standard rate band of a single person which I would not favour. The amendment regarding the standard rate band proposed by Deputies Mitchell and McGrath would cost &euro;270.5 million in a full year. Deputy McDowell's amendment would cost &euro;170 million.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated on many occasions, the Government is committed in An Action Programme for the Millennium to work towards having 80% of income earners taxed at the standard rate. With allowances converted to tax credits, the only way to get the number in the top tax rate down is to widen the standard rate tax band. The most effective way to widen the tax band is to put it on an individual basis and tax a person on what they earn as individuals, whether single or married. The first step in this direction was taken two years ago. It was continued in last year's Finance Act and we are continuing along this road in this year's Bill. Considerable progress has been made and, as a result of the band widening, which is provided for in the Bill, the percentage of income earners on the higher rate will fall to 26.7%. This compares, for example, with 32% paying at the top rate in 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>The provision of a separate standard rate band for each taxpayer is part of the Government's policy and there is no going back on it. That policy has also been endorsed by the social partners through the PPF. In the circumstances, Deputies will understand I cannot accept the amendments. We have had debates on this issue in the past. On Second Stage, Deputy Mitchell raised the case of a person from a midlands constituency which he reiterated this morning. The Deputy suggested we are now in a position where if one spouse of a married two income couple were to lose his or her job, the couple would end up paying more income tax. I indicated this could not happen in so far as our tax calculations are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the example of a two income couple, one spouse has an income of &euro;45,000 while the other has &euro;24,500 which is in or around the current average industrial wage. Let us assume also that the couple splits its credits equally so that each has the benefit of a personal and a PAYE credit. The net tax liability of the couple, post budget 2000, through credits and bands is &euro;12,510. If the spouse on the lower incomes loses his or her job, there is no income attributed to that spouse on which income tax may be charged, whereas the income tax position of the other spouse may not remain the same as before that person may avail of a wider standard band, a married one earner band, he or she may also avail of the married personal tax credit. The net result is that the tax liability of the couple would fall to &euro;7,060. In this example, the couple's income <Col N="250" /> dropped by 35% but the net income tax liability dropped by 44%. I am prepared to look at the case to which the Deputy referred and if he forwards the details I shall have it examined. If the Deputy is referring to the traditional one income couple and a married couple on the same income, that is a different question and we have been down that road many times before.</P>
    <P>Given that we have discussed this issue so many times, there is a sense of <i>deja vu</i> about it. I happen to think the sting has gone out of the Opposition in regard to it. Whatever about Deputy McDowell, Deputy McGrath is preparing for the election campaign in County Westmeath. I do not expect Deputy McDowell to go around his constituency preaching this particular gospel. Were he to do so he would offend a great many trade union activists all over the country and the established policy of SIPTU for many years, endorsed in the height of my troubles by the SIPTU Equality Officer, Ms Rosheen Callender, who is not noted as a supporter of mine. I greatly appreciated her comments at a difficult time when it would have been far easier for her, given her political views, to have said nothing. I do not know Ms Callender very well but, as I said on Committee Stage, she has risen in my estimation, because it would have been far easier for her to have stayed at home and said nothing. However, she did what she considered was her duty. In fact, Ms Callender was opposed to the home carer's credit when I introduced it.</P>
    <P>Whatever about Deputy McGrath's position, I am always amused at Deputy McDowell's position on the matter of widening the standard rate band. As long as I have been in political life and from my student days I always knew that those who wanted equality in these areas were those on the left of Irish politics. Deputy McDowell is adopting a position which is not in keeping with that of any of his trade union activist friends, either now or in the past. Deputy McGrath has a battle to fight in County Westmeath on a particular level. I look forward not only to his comments in the election campaign but the comments of other parties.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered the married couple tax credit is double the personal tax credit. There is also the home carer's allowance which I introduced when I started to widen the standard rate band. The Fianna Fáil election manifesto stated that I would introduce the £2,000 home carer's allowance at the standard rate. I would not have attempted to introduce it in my first step in the widening of the standard rate band except for the hullabaloo created. I would have introduced it at the end of the second or third phase of the widening of the band.</P>
    <P>What has amused me in this debate, and again this morning, is that what was regarded by many commentators and left wingers as the dark old days of Ireland in the 1940s, 1950 and 1960s when equality was not an issue, up to and including the tax year 1980-81, there were not double bands. It was an innovation in the 1980-81 budget and <Col N="251" /> Finance Act to have double married bands. Effectively, I have stepped back&mdash;</P>

      <P>At that time there were not as many double income couples and there was no hue and cry in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s about this issue. I have looked at many papers, but it has not been suggested in any of them that the measure was anti-family. The Government met its obligations under the Murphy judgment in 1981, but it decided also to double the bands. Although there was no demand for it at the time, nobody said that it was anti-family. I have restored the system that applied then, which is uniquely Irish and does not apply in many other countries. This is a matter of equity and fairness, among other things. One can use the labour market argument, but it is basically a matter of fairness in the taxation of earnings.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised the matter of the supposition that tax is a negative thing. Most left-wing thinkers, including the Deputy, disagree with my philosophy in this regard. I have no difficulty with those who hold his opinion, but at least I understand it, even if I cannot share it. The philosophy is not unique to those on the left wing in Ireland as it has been embedded deeply in the political and economic psychology of many central European countries during the past 30 or 40 years. Such thinkers believe, to put it simply, that the wealth a person creates somehow does not belong to him or her, but to the State. I totally reject the idea that the State is obliging taxpayers by allowing them to keep their money. One should be allowed to retain one's earnings as an employee or an employer.</P>
      <P>The State's role is to encourage people to better themselves, to do greater things and to be more ambitious. This creates greater economic wealth, which the State can redistribute in particular directions through its taxation system. One cannot distribute something one does not have, which is why I fundamentally disagree with an economic and political approach that starts with the endgame, which begins by putting in place a taxation system so that moneys can be redistributed. We should have a taxation system which encourages individuals and thereby creates greater wealth. With respect to both philosophies, I believe the system I advocate is the one which has created greater wealth. It has allowed greater resources to go into particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of taxation is the essence of democratic rule. People in Deputy McDowell's constituency may want a particular public service, but the electorate as a whole has elected Deputies to make decisions on taxation and public expenditure. People want certain things and the system of taxation which enables that is at the core of our democracy. I believe that people respond better to incentivisation than anything else and I <Col N="252" /> have had the opportunity to put that into practice. Deputy Jim Mitchell referred to another aspect of this, which is the growth in public expenditure. I admit public expenditure has grown, but it has been in line with the resources we have been able to make available.</P>

Should it not have put more resources into education? Should it not have allocated £40 billion towards the national development plan, a large chunk of which was for infrastructural development?</P>

      <P>We have increased expenditure in these areas while maintaining budget surpluses, which is the only way to reduce the national debt. It may remain static as a percentage if GNP or GDP increases, but I have reduced it both in percentage and absolute terms. While running these substantial surpluses, I have allocated &euro;8 billion to the national pensions reserve fund. If I had not done so, I would have been able to use the money to reduce the national debt further. Ireland's national debt is now the second lowest in the European Union. I do not mind if people want to have their cake and eat it coming up to an election, but one cannot simultaneously increase public expenditure, retain reasonable levels of taxation, reduce the national debt, increase expenditure on roads and abolish vehicle registration tax to reduce the price of cars. Someone has to pay the social welfare, education and Garda bills at the end of each month. I have tried to introduce a fairer and more equitable direct taxation system to allow people to regain control of their money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to respond to the Minister. In reply to a point made by Deputy McDowell, higher levels of taxation do not necessarily lead to higher yields. The lower rate of taxation yields a higher return because there is more economic activity in that sector. I agree with the Minister in that respect, but I do not believe he should spend money as if it is going out of fashion. Spending money <i>per se</i> is not a great idea unless one is going to get a return for it. The Minister has ranted about higher allocations for roads and other matters, but he has not spent money as he planned. He has not spent enough on capital projects. Investment in infrastructure sows the seeds of future economic growth, but the Minister has failed to meet deadlines on all fronts in that regard. He has thrown money at the health service and expenditure in that sector has doubled, in real terms. I have raised this matter for years as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, but with what result? Money has been wasted and squandered without results.</P>
      <P>The Minister has exceeded by £13 billion his target of five years ago of 4% growth per annum in real terms. He may try to justify this by saying that economic growth was much greater than expected, and we can buy into that to a certain extent, but I want to know why so many people have been left behind. Why do widows receive only £90 per week, without applying for free schemes? Why do 20% of children leave primary school with learning difficulties, at least three quarters of which are avoidable? There is a queue of many years for the psychological assessment on which the provision of additional facilities for schools is based. Where has the extra £13 billion gone? It certainly has not gone to the less well-off in society. People with disabilities needed &euro;36 million this year for services to give them hope, but they were given &euro;6 million. There are social as well as economic priorities. By and large I agree with the Minister's priorities, but I am astonished that a Government led by a Taoiseach from my constituency can be so unaware of the considerable list of gaping holes regarding the poor which have gone unattended.</P>
      <P>These amendments deal with the mother in the home who has chosen to forego an income to look after her children. All mothers have a right to make such a choice without being penalised, but that is what this Government has done through individualisation. Equally, every mother has the right to go out to work and the costs of doing so should be recognised by the tax regime. The stress and pressure which many double income families experience must also be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is coming to the end of five years in office. In real terms he is spending £13 billion <Col N="254" /> more than was available five years ago yet he has left a trail of misery among many groups. I do not understand how the Minister could have accomplished this given the largesse available to him. I do not see why he should deliberately discriminate against the mother who chooses to stay in the home. I place great value on this role which should also be recognised by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>So I am not allowed to ramble. How do I respond to the ramblings of the other Deputies?</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of high taxation, but I am seeking to highlight the other side of the equation, namely, that tax is used for public investment. It may not all be well spent, as Deputy Mitchell has rightly stated, but we cannot undertake public investment without tax. I acknowledge that the tax wedge five or ten years ago was higher than was sustainable, that it produced serious disincentives and had to be reduced. However, I have stated previously that we have gone too far and I do not like the way in which we have approached the issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister points out that those countries which pursue a philosophy similar to his have created additional wealth, but I am not sure that is entirely correct. I could also point to countries in western Europe which have not pursued the same course as the Minister in which levels of wealth and economic growth over the decades have been as high as in, for example, the US. What is beyond doubt is that those countries which pursued the Minister's philosophy, such as the UK in the 1980s and the US for a long period, in addition to creating wealth also created inequality on a level which most of the rest of us find unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equality issue is interesting as regards this amendment. However, it misses the essential point that before the Minister embarked on the process of individualisation it was open to a married couple in which both partners worked to divide the standard rate band and the personal tax credits or allowances as they wished. They had the choice of doing so and it was not necessarily the case that the male partner had the tax credits or the standard rate band. I benefited enormously from the Minister's individualisation agenda over the past couple of years in so far as my wife <Col N="255" /> always succeeded in earning just enough to use up the entire standard rate band and most of my allowances. As a result virtually everything I earned was taxed at the higher rate whereas, courtesy of the Minister's changes, I now at least have a standard rate band of &euro;19,000 for which I am eternally grateful. Nonetheless we had the choice, which we exercised, to divide the standard rate band and our tax credits in a particular way. In our case my wife took the lot and, no doubt, we were not unique in that sense. However, the point is that the choice was ours and we exercised it in a particular way. Therefore, the Minister's argument about equality does not stand up.</P>

      <P>Traditionally we engage in a philosophical overview at the start of this debate. However, if precedent is anything to go by we get a bit tighter, or more tired, as the day does on.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to increase personal tax credits to take the minimum wage out of the tax net. The Minister has pursued several agendas over the past five years and budgets. He has pursued the individualisation agenda which we have just discussed and for which he had no mandate as it was not signalled to the electorate in 1997. He also reduced the rates of income tax for which, as he said many times, he had a clear mandate, even though I disagree with it as a method of reducing tax. As part of the PPF two years ago he committed himself to &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo;&ndash; I think that was the word he used &ndash; to take the minimum wage out of the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We sometimes phrase this issue incorrectly and, perhaps, the amendment should suggest that the first &euro;236 of weekly income of all taxpayers is taken out of the tax net. We have gone as far as we can in terms of tax reductions, but this is the one aim which we should have, but have not achieved. If necessary this aim should have been achieved at the cost of not doing quite a few of the other things which the Minister has done. He pats himself on the back for introducing the minimum wage and, to some extent, I acknowledge that fact. He took the lead in this regard and the experience of the past three or four years has proved wrong the naysayers, of which there were many, including in his Department. There is no <Col N="256" /> evidence that the minimum wage has done away with many jobs as many economists predicted three or four years. I acknowledge that the move towards an hourly minimum wage was a welcome development on which we have to build and develop.</P>
    <P>The basic principle is simple, namely, if we take the view that people should not be paid less than &euro;236 for a 39 hour week then surely it is unconscionable, and it is certainly inconsistent, for us to take some of that money from them. If we introduce a minimum wage largely as an anti-exploitation measure, as I think was the case, then it is inconsistent to then take some of that money back by way of tax. That is the central point behind this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment in principle. The problem with the minimum wage is that it is extremely costly if one adopts the Minister's approach. Under this approach it is not only those on the minimum wage who benefit, but all those who pay tax. In order to give the well justified relief to those on the minimum wage we have to give the concession to others, even those on large incomes. This ends up costing a fortune.</P>
      <P>If we continue to adopt the Minister's approach it will cost almost &euro;1 billion. I have seen different formulations which would reduce this figure to, in one case, &euro;650 million and in another to £150 million, which is about &euro;200 million. This is before one takes account of the Minister's budgetary proposals which cover 90% of those on the minimum wage. We cannot justify further concessions to people on high incomes and we must find a way of meeting the objective of these amendments without the huge burden of giving the concession to those higher up the tax net. There is a formula that would cost about £75 million &ndash; give the tax back and provide on a tapered scale for those marginally over the limit at the end of the tax year. It is not perfect but the tax could be given back, thus allowing for the fact that it was on loan to the Exchequer. We would be targeting the very group that needs to be targeted without giving up the concession. A major part of the cost of the concession goes to those who earn more than the minimum wage. We all agree that those earning less than the minimum wage should not be paying tax. There is 10% of income remaining that must be covered and we must find a way to do it; there is every possibility we could do it this year by way of retrospection. I hope the Minister accepts the principle that it should not be delayed any further and that, in so far as it is possible, he should find a way to target the relief solely towards those on the minimum wage, with a tapering relief for those just above it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments propose increasing the basic personal tax credits for married and single persons over and above those already provided for in the Bill. The cost of the <Col N="257" /> increases proposed by Deputy McDowell would be &euro;545 million in a full year and would, therefore, almost double the cost of the entire income tax package in the budget for 2002. The purpose of the amendment, as explained by Deputy McDowell, is to exempt the minimum wage from tax but the amendment would go further in that, when taken together with the revised employee tax credit of &euro;660 proposed in the Bill, it would exempt from tax income of almost &euro;500 per year in excess of the annual minimum wage. Provisions in the Bill already give rise to significant increases that will bring us up to a position consistent with the available resources and the commitment under the PPF where incomes at 90% of the minimum wage will be exempt from tax. I remind the Deputy that the PPF commitment is to remove all those earning the minimum wage from the tax net over time.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the percentage of low paid earners in the tax net has decreased as a result of the five budgets I have introduced. This year's budget means 692,000 people will be outside the tax net altogether. This represents 37% of all income earners, compared to a figure of 325,000, or 25% of income earners, before the 1998 budget. The increases in tax credits already provided for in section 3 of the Bill will cost &euro;400 million in a full year, while the overall budget package designed to consolidate the strategy to remove more low paid from the tax net and more middle income earners from the top tax rate will cost &euro;624 million. That is the most that can be afforded in the current economic circumstances and I therefore oppose the amendments.</P>
      <P>The Deputies referred to the cost of getting more people earning the minimum wage out of the tax net altogether and Deputy Mitchell referred to different ways of doing this. The cheapest way is to start with exemption limits. I have gone away from exemption limits, however, in the tax code because the dreadful step off a cliff came into being.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is proposing a new version that includes tapering. Over the years I have got down to a figure of 1,000 people on marginal relief, getting rid of the very real disincentive that existed against engaging in the workforce. If I wanted to go down that route by exempting the minimum wage by increasing the exemption limits, it would cost &euro;67.9 million in a full year but it is the least progressive step in my view. Deputy Mitchell has tabled an amendment that would taper relief at the end. We had marginal relief at the step-off point before and it caused many difficulties and I have tried to get away from that. In all of my budgets, I have increased the personal allowances and the personal tax credits and that has had the effect of getting rid of that problem. I have not been increasing the exemption limits and I would be <Col N="258" /> reluctant to go back to that. My approach has been the most effective way to do this. I am not adverse to new thinking in this regard but I would not advocate returning to the exemption limits. It was a goal of mine to get rid of them totally and I have nearly succeeded. Exemption limits only apply to a very small number of taxpayers now and they are mostly older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell is right, there are a number of ways to skin this cat and one is by using exemption limits. It would also be possible to do this by increasing the PAYE tax credit although I favour increasing the personal tax credit. I am persuaded by the same argument as the Minister about exemption limits. It was highlighted by the Tax and Social Welfare Integration Group some years ago that the marginal relief in place to deal with the exemption limits that previously pertained simply did not deal with most of the problems, there could be serious disincentive effects, and people would end up taking home less even though they were earning more. Exemption limits are not the way to go even though they are the most efficient in terms of cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>While I am not nervous about a small increase in the PAYE tax credit, I am conscious of the fact that it is not transferable between spouses so, to maintain consistency in my argument about individualisation, we could hardly go down the route of individualising the personal tax credits as well. By a process of elimination the best way &ndash; and probably the cleanest way &ndash; to do this is to increase the personal tax credit to take the first &euro;236 of weekly income out of the tax net. The Minister pointed out that I have gone a little beyond that. I did that to take into account that the minimum wage will increase in October, providing for a somewhat higher figure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the age tax credit and reflects the discussion we have just had. The Minister has, in relation to the tax burden on older people, moved along the exemption road, whereas my preference is to move along the tax credit road. We are all agreed that people who have retired are entitled to a certain additional benefit in terms of their tax credit and should pay less tax on income than others. The main reason for that is that most older people derive most of their income from pensions. We are saying that private pensions should be treated in a way that is more beneficial from a tax point of view than earned income. We agree with the Minister about the thrust of policy <Col N="259" /> in the area and it is simply a matter of whether we go the exemption or tax credit route. For the reasons I gave earlier, I prefer the tax credit route.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to increase the age tax credit for married persons from &euro;410, as proposed in the Bill, to &euro;550. The cost of the amendment is estimated at &euro;3.1 million in the full year and if it were extended to single and widowed persons, as in equity it would have to be, it would cost &euro;5.4 million. The elderly already have favourable treatment under the income tax code and rightly so.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy is anxious to remove from the tax net those with small personal or private pensions in addition to the social welfare pension. This would also be my wish. However, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, it boils down to choice of method and my preferred method is to proceed by way of increasing the exemption limits rather than increased tax credits. This targets available resources on those most in need and removes a majority of pensioners from the tax net. The Bill substantially increases the exemption limits for those aged 65 years and over, both married and single. The new limit will be &euro;26,000 for married couples and &euro;13,000 for single people, a virtual doubling of the limits since I took up office. Married couples will be tax free on occupational pensions of up to &euro;254 per week. This year alone, as a result of increased exemption limits, more than 11,000 elderly people will be removed from the tax net. As a result of tax improvements over the past five budgets, 71,500 elderly people have been taken out of the tax net. While I have the same objective as the Deputy, I am satisfied my approach is more appropriate. In the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree there is an inconsistency but my approach to the tax exemption route has ensured that almost all have been removed from that step-off, except for a small number aged 65 years and over &ndash; I understand it may be 1,000 or 2,000. The disincentive question is not an issue for those in that age group.</P>
      <P>When I took up office I implemented reform in this area. Apart from effectively doubling the exemption limits, I abolished the conditions applying to those aged between 65 and 70 years and those over 70 and 75 years of age, thus ensuring that the same conditions would apply to those over the age of 65 years. As a result everybody has benefited.</P>

      <P>At the various ECOFIN meetings in Europe there has been an emphasis on the need to encourage people to continue working beyond the age of 65 years, whereas the emphasis in this country during my political career has been on reducing the retiring age.

      <P>There is a general view that it is good to continue giving concessions to the elderly. However, this ignores the fact that some of the elderly are very wealthy. On the one hand people on incomes of £103 per week are not entitled to medical cards, yet friends of mine, who worked in Guinness and the various banks and are on pensions of perhaps £120,000 per annum, are entitled to them. There is a need for some perspective on this issue.</P>
      <P>The culture of retirement of people in the early to middle 50s needs to be revisited as it is not, perhaps, what the economy needs. While I acknowledge that help for the elderly is a good thing <i>per se,</i> any general election candidate who might argue to the contrary would risk losing his or her deposit. However, in the interests of equity it must be asked if we can tolerate a situation where those over the age of 65 who are very wealthy should be entitled to a medical card while those under the age of 65 who have an income of only £103 per week are not.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 10, to delete &ldquo;&euro;500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&euro;750&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to the tax credits given to parents of incapacitated children. For many years the allowance, as it was then, was virtually unchanged. While the Minister has increased it in recent years it is still at a very low level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complex area in the tax code because other tax credits have also to be taken into account. In another section of the Bill, the Minister considerably increased the tax credit given to those who employ carers, some of whom would <Col N="261" /> also benefit from this amendment. I commend his move in this area but it is only of benefit to those who can afford to spend up to &euro;30,000, the maximum threshold provided for, on employing a carer to look after a disabled child or elderly relative.</P>
    <P>The credit proposed in the amendment is nothing more than an acknowledgement to parents of incapacitated or disabled children because the costs incurred by them in any given year would be considerably greater. I have been lobbied by people in my constituency who consider that the acknowledgement of the additional costs they necessarily incur in looking after a disabled child should be increased to a more realistic figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to increase the incapacitated child tax credit by 50% over and above the increase already provided for in the Bill. The cost of the increase would be &euro;2.5 million in a full year. The incapacitated child tax credit is already substantially increased in the Bill, by over 22%, which is a generous increase by any standards. The Government also intends to invest approximately &euro;1.27 billion in substantially increasing child benefit, which will apply to incapacitated children. In addition, where appropriate, an incapacitated child may be the subject of a claim in respect of the home carers tax credit or, alternatively, the relief in respect of a person employed to care for an incapacitated individual, which I am more than doubling in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In the Bill I have allocated &euro;100 million to fund cuts in personal income tax credits alone and this is as far as I can be reasonably expected to go within the financial constraints of this year's tax cutting package. I therefore cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In his last comment the Minister is pushing out the boat. Nobody could seriously claim this is an expensive tax credit.

      <P>The umbrella organisation representing the disabled associations &ndash; the blind, deaf and those in wheelchairs &ndash; looked for a package of &euro;36 million but only got &euro;6 million. We are not able to find &euro;30 million to help them.

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&ndash;The maximum income allowance which determines qualification for the Home Carer Tax credit as set out in section 466A of the Principal Act shall be not less than the annual value of the old age contributory pension.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to flag the fact that in this year's budget the Minister has not increased the earning allowance earners have before spouses can claim the home carer's tax credit. As it stands, one can earn between £4,000 and £6,000 on a tapering basis, which is &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000 odd, before one's spouse loses the home carer's tax credit.</P>
      <P>While tabling this amendment, I acknowledge that at the moment the old age contributory pension does not infringe upon that, at least not to any great extent. However, we must keep an eye on the fact that people who are on social welfare benefits could find their spouses disqualified from claiming the home carer tax credits simply by virtue of the fact that we are increasing social welfare benefits even though this year the Minister did not increase the earning allowance.</P>
      <P>This is intended to flag a potential problem if we do not continue to increase the earning allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes a new section 4 which provides that the income disregard of the carer's spouse should not be an amount less than the old age contributory pension which, for 2002, stands at &euro;7,660. The current income disregard is &euro;5,080 and there is a taper, so the reduced entitlements apply to those incomes up to &euro;6,620. I assume the Deputy's amendment would increase the income disregard from its current level at &euro;5,080 to &euro;7,660, which means there would be full entitlement to home carer's tax credit at income levels up to &euro;7,660 and reduced entitlement where the income is between &euro;7,660 and &euro;9,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income disregard was introduced to allow the home carer to have a small income in his or her own right while retaining the tax credit and the existing system provides for this. It was intended to cover situations where spouses forfeit a second income to care for dependants in the home. I appreciate that the situation with income disregard has not increased and increases in <Col N="263" /> income can result in some people losing entitlement to the credit or having only reduced credit. However, there should be discretion to take decisions in this area in the annual budget and it should not be that such disregards are increased in line with particular social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 476:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;476A.&ndash;Where an individual who subscribed, as part of the initial public offering, for shares in Eircom plc, has sustained a loss (&ldquo;the loss&rdquo;) and such individual is not entitled under any other provision of this Act to relief for such loss than for the 2002 year of assessment the individual may in computing his or her liability to tax take a deduction equating to the amount of the loss at the standard rate.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to give effect to the Fine Gael proposal that those people who bought Eircom shares and who cannot avail of the capital gains offset should be allowed to offset their losses against other income taxes.</P>
      <P>I have been amazed by some of the initial reactions to this proposal, much of which I consider to be ranting and raving. The position is that all the institutional investors in Eircom availed of risk advice and expert advice. They were able to reclaim their losses in Eircom against other capital gains. Capital gains is income from capital investment and is already treated favourably in that it is only taxed at 20% in the pound. Those whose incomes come from work &ndash; earnings &ndash; pay 20% on the initial tranche but pay 42% on higher incomes plus health levy and PRSI. Those whose income comes from capital gains are already at an enormous tax advantage, paying perhaps more than 30% less tax on every pound than those in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue goes beyond Eircom and if it were extended beyond Eircom it would raise major issues that would need further study &ndash; I am not excluding the need for further study. If we are <Col N="264" /> aiming for a shareholder society which we should be, we should not allow capital gains losses against any income; it should not just be confined to capital gains, which it is in this case.</P>
    <P>The result is that big corporations with lots of experience and risk analysis available to them have already received their 20% rebate and we estimate the cost to the Exchequer at &euro;140 million. Most ordinary people have no experience of investment or risk analysis. They were carried away by the Government's hyping of the flotation which cost £74 million. They were not aware that the Government had jacked up the price of the share against the advice of the Eircom board.</P>
    <P>There should be the same concession for the ordinary man in the street who invested in Eircom as the big institutional investors. It says something about our society that there is a growing group of people who are so capitalist in their outlook that they have no concept of equity or social justice and who would deride a proposal which is manifestly fair. It is confined to this issue because of the Government's role in it. The maximum cost of this proposal would be &euro;90 million, a once-off cost as there are no repeat costs involved. That is the maximum estimate because we assume that everybody who was not an institutional investor was unable to claim the capital gains offset. I am sure some of those wealthy individual investors would have other capital gains against which to offset their losses. The &euro;90 million is a maximum and I do not doubt it would be some millions less than that.</P>
    <P>The issue of old age pensioners who borrowed from the credit union and who have no tax liability has been raised. We have provided for that and they would receive a rebate of money. There would be very few in that category but there would be some. If we are interested in social justice that goes all the way. However, this gives rise to the greater issue, which should be studied in the future, of the implications of encouraging ordinary people who do not have capital gains or a useful portfolio of shares &ndash; they may have modest shares &ndash; to get more shares in order to encourage private savings. Why should we not let them offset their losses on such investments against their income taxes in the way institutional investors can already offset them? Not only institutional investors but wealthy individuals with investment experience and resources to invest can already claim 12%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tourist Victim Support Service, TVSS, is a private company, registered as a charity, which receives funding from a range of bodies in the public and private sectors. It is based in Garda Headquarters, Harcourt Street in offices provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is overseen by an advisory board which includes representatives of the umbrella Victim Support organisation, the TVSS full time co-ordinator, Bord Fáilte, Dublin Tourism, Dublin Corporation, the Irish Hotels Federation, Aer Rianta, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and other partners in the tourism sector. TVSS receives no funds from my Department but it has been in receipt of an annual grant of £15,000 from Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>TVSS was established in 1994 and completed its seventh year of operation in 2001. Since its inception, the service has assisted more than 5,300 tourists. From the point of view of tourism, it is fair to say the service has been a success. It provides assistance to those in need and I understand that to a large extent clients seen by the service go home with an overall positive image of Ireland. I understand the number of referrals to TVSS by the Garda Síochána in 2001 decreased by 8%. I welcome the fact that there has been a gradual but steady reduction in the number of referrals since 1999. This may suggest that some of the experience gained from the TVSS system is being used by the mainstream Garda Síochána. However, as far as our visitors are concerned, there is no cause for complacency because there is no acceptable level of crime and one outrage is one too many.</P>
      <P>TVSS has been campaigning for some time for an increase in the level of its funding. I understand that it made a presentation last month to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation. I have been informed that Bord Fáilte has recently agreed to increase its annual subvention to &euro;25,394.69, equivalent to £20,000. This represents an increase of a third on the figure provided last year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>I understand the TVSS is attempting to increase sponsorship and I call on the many tourism enterprises who avail of or have access to the referral service to consider making a contribution or, as Bord Fáilte has done, to increase their current contribution to the funding of its activities if they wish to see it continue. It is important to emphasise that the most recent visitor attitudes survey by Bord Fáilte in 2001 confirms that safety and security are not issues for our visitors, with the great majority considering Ireland a satisfactory destination in this regard.</P>

        <b>: </b>At the recent meeting mentioned by the Minister of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation it was unanimously decided to recommend to the Minister, who would, it was hoped, recommend the same to Bord Fáilte, that the salaries of the two full time staff &ndash; that of the co-ordinator, &euro;42,409 and that of the assistant co-ordinator, &euro;16,741, for a total of £59,150 &ndash; should be borne in full. At present funding comes from a variety of different agencies but there is still a huge shortfall. Does the Minister accept that the company, which is a voluntary company, has looked after more than 5,000 victims since its inception, that it has given material, emotional and practical support across a range of areas and that when people come to Victim Support they are referred by the Garda, so it is accepted as an agency which fills a gap? There is an urgent need for 100% funding. The tourist victim support service in Amsterdam, which was set up at the same time as ours, receives its funding from central government, from local government and from the police. There is a real need to put the TVSS on a properly structured basis so that it does not need to come cap in hand to various agencies and organisations and also to the Government.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the excellent work done by the TVSS. However, the matter of salaries is one for the organisation. My reading of this is that while a structure has been set up, it was also agreed that another assistant co-ordinator was needed from within its own ranks without the permission of those involved. It went ahead to make that appointment. An organisation cannot make extra appointments without permission. That is what the problem has been. It is proper that we should reconsider the position of Victim Support. I am happy that referrals are down by 8%. There is no question about the work it does but as I said, the matter of the salaries of the co-ordinator and assistant co-ordinator is one for themselves. However, I see the Deputy's point.</P>

        <b>: </b>In the context of the relatively small decline of 8% in referrals, does the Minister accept that recently published figures from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda indicate that the figures for violent crime and assaults are up by a considerable amount? Does he accept that on the basis of the proportions of race-based attacks, we should expect a similar increase in the number of tourists attacked? This is something we do not like to broadcast. Does the Minister accept that the manner in which TVSS manages to disseminate a positive image of Ireland is a key consideration? This is due to the sensitive and practical way in which its staff deal with people. Examples include the cases of the German tourist murdered in County Meath, the Chinese student murdered recently and of course Guido Nasi the Italian student. Does the Minister accept that the amount being sought is a relative pittance when <Col N="267" /> compared to the huge revenue contributed by tourism?</P>

      <P>The amount of funding is not the problem. It is the structure that exists within the TVSS organisation. It is difficult for any organisation to say that it wants an extra assistant co-ordinator yet expects somebody else to pick up the tab.</P>
      <P>I hope the figures mentioned by the Deputy have been reduced and I agree with what he said. However, there is already a very positive image of this country and the support received by tourists, particularly in rural Ireland. Dublin is one of the major European capitals with very few complaints in that area. Dublin and Ireland are safe places.</P>

The association has also, in its recently published strategic review, recommended that it should consider allowing the use of Croke Park by other codes, on an occasional basis, as soon as the redevelopment of the stadium is completed and the newly laid pitch has been proved capable of accommodating a games programme. The pitch is currently being re-laid and is expected to accommodate games from as early as June this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" />At the meeting on 27 February, the GAA confirmed that motions on the decision-making process in regard to the use of Croke Park by other codes are on the agenda at its annual congress in mid-April. Should these recommendations-motions be approved by its congress, the GAA has confirmed to the Government that it will then be in a position to consider the request to accommodate some of the European championship games.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the Government has agreed with the Scottish Executive to establish a joint bid steering committee, comprising representatives of the Government, the Scottish Executive, the FAI and the Scottish FA, to oversee preparation of the bid documentation for submission to UEFA by the due date of 31 May 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply. Obviously, the GAA must sort out its own affairs. However, in the context of the planning permission the GAA currently has for the Croke Park site, how many events, apart from its own events, is the organisation allowed to hold each year? Does the GAA require planning permission for floodlighting? Will floodlighting be part of the requirement for the 2008 European championships? Are infrastructure problems being addressed? Have preconditions been put down by the IRFU which would effectively mean the Lansdowne Road-Croke Park proposal cannot go forward because the IRFU is not prepared to be part of the proposal unless the national stadium is provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, I believe the GAA has planning permission for either three or six events. Planning permission is required for floodlighting, particularly floodlighting for a national stadium. I understand the GAA has applied for floodlighting for Croke Park but that is a matter for the GAA.</P>
      <P>I will be meeting the IRFU this evening, having met with all relevant organisations at different times in relation to the stadium and the 2008 bid being made together with the Scottish FA. There are a number of options depending on what happens at the GAA annual congress and what happens concerning the national stadium. The IRFU has stated publicly that it is unwilling to reduce its capacity at Lansdowne Road to 35,000 unless the national stadium is a runner. The IRFU can accommodate 49,000 spectators at present. If it was to reduce that capacity to a 35,000 all-seat stadium at Lansdowne Road, capacity for 14,000 spectators would be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No organisation wants to lose that level of capacity and the IRFU knows there could be 50,000 or more spectators at the English, Welsh, Scottish and French matches, to name but four matches. It is only natural that the IRFU has reservations but there are three options open to us at present, whether that is option AB, AC or BC. These matters remain entirely optional and until <Col N="269" /> I meet all relevant organisations I will not be able to give the Deputy a full answer on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposal that is to go to UEFA by the end of May, if planning permission is not forthcoming for floodlighting at Croke Park and if the issue of extending the number of events &ndash; apart from the non-GAA events covered in the present planning permission &ndash; is not dealt with, will that render the application into a form which is unlikely to be accepted? I am saying this against the background of greatly welcoming this prestigious event here in 2008.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether floodlighting is required for the 2008 championships. The event is in the summer and will take place from 7-29 June. Floodlighting will not be required as most matches will be played in the earlier part of the day. What is required is at least two stadiums capable of holding 30,000 spectators. For a semi or quarter final, one of those stadiums would have to be capable of holding more than 40,000 spectators, and perhaps more than 50,000 for a semi final. While there is some degree of uncertainty at present, I am sure Deputies will agree that by 2008 all of these facilities will be available to us. There seems to be a difficulty at present with the date of 31 May but Lansdowne Road, Croke Park and the national stadium, which I have always backed, will be available by 2008.</P>
      <P>It would be a great pity to lose out on these championships because the World Cup has changed to six world zones. The World Cup will come to Europe only every 24 years. All of the other major countries of Europe after 2008 will be bidding year after year for the European championships. We will never get this chance again and must take it this time.</P>

      <P>The overview of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project conducted by independent consultants High Point Rendel was published on 31 January 2002. The Government has requested me to report on the implications of the HPR recommendations and options and in particular to evaluate the viability of the existing tendering strategy as a basis for any modification of the stadium design and operation, the implications for the Exchequer of the options and recommendations, and the issues raised in paragraph 1.7 of the report. I propose to circulate a copy of this in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have initiated a process for the consideration of these issues. I will draw on a wide area <Col N="270" /> of expertise and advice so that a thorough evaluation of the recommendations is made to ensure the Government is in a position to reach the best and most appropriate decision on the future of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland. Until I have completed this evaluation and reported to Government it would be premature to make any statement on the future plans for this project or to speculate on the extent of any future expenditure on the project. However, the Government remains convinced that a stadium project at Abbotstown is both desirable and feasible and that the Abbotstown campus can and will be developed into a vital infrastructure asset for the achievement of national aims in the field of sports, recreation and related tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund is ten to 21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, involvement in crime and-or drugs, etc.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas where integrated plans were prepared on the basis of detailed guidelines agreed by the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs. Local development groups were set up in each area and comprised representatives from the relevant local drugs task force, the local authority and the VEC. These plans were submitted for consideration via the task forces to the national assessment committee chaired by my Department. The plans were assessed against the guidelines agreed and recommendations were then made to the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs.</P>
      <P>Recognising that the drug problem is not confined to the drugs task force areas in Dublin and Cork city, funding was also allocated to a number of urban areas outside the task force areas where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The target areas selected were Galway, Limerick, south Cork city, Waterford, Carlow and Bray. The vocational education committees in these areas and the health board in the case of Waterford were asked to take the lead in developing integrated drug prevention strategies in consultation with relevant statutory and community-voluntary interests on the basis guidelines agreed by the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs. The Deputy should note that south Cork city subsequently became part of the Cork local drugs task force while Bray was designated a drugs task force in its own right in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A separate allocation was also made to assist a number of voluntary organisations with a national or regional remit which have the capacity to deliver targeted education and pre<Col N="273" /> vention initiatives. Under this allocation, seven voluntary organisations were approved funding to deliver drug prevention-education programmes, including peer education programmes, on a national basis.</P>
    <P>An amount of &euro;129.5 million has been provided under the national development plan to support measures under the fund. Since 1998, an amount of &euro;60.2 million has been allocated and of this amount, &euro;46.1 million has been allocated to local drugs task force areas while the urban areas of Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Carlow were allocated a further &euro;1.9 million. In addition, the voluntary organisations referred to have been allocated &euro;0.6 million and implementation costs of &euro;2.5 million have also been allocated. The Springboard Initiative which falls under the remit of the Department of Health and Children was allocated an additional &euro;9.1 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>In broad terms, approximately 350 facility and services projects are being supported under the fund. These initiatives fall under seven broad headings: first, the building, renovating or fitting out of community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs so as to provide suitable accommodation for programmes and services geared for the most at risk young people in an area. Access for the target group is an essential condition of funding for capital projects; second, a number of purpose-built youth centres are being funded which will provide a focal point for youth activities in an area, particularly in areas such as Tallaght, Ballymun, Clondalkin, Blanchardstown in Dublin and, in Cork, where there has been a dearth of dedicated youth facilities; third, more than 85 youth and outreach workers have been appointed to work on the ground with the target group offering developmental activities and educational programmes for young people who have traditionally found themselves outside the scope of mainstream youth work due to family background, involvement with crime or drugs or through lack of education; fourth, ten sports workers have been employed to encourage greater involvement of the target group in sports and recreational activities; fifth, a wide variety of community-based prevention-education programmes, including early school leaving programmes, sports and recreational activities, family support programmes, art, drama and music programmes, counselling and transport services are being supported; sixth, a number of targeted interventions for particular groups such as youth work projects for young travellers have been put in place; and seventh, a number of national drugs education and training officers for youth organisations catering for the target group who will deliver programmes throughout the organisation have also been employed.</P>
    <P>To date, &euro;32.9 million has been allocated to capital projects in the task force areas. This was made up of an original allocation of &euro;16.9 million in 1998 followed by increased capital allocations <Col N="274" /> of &euro;3.3 million in 2000 and &euro;12.7 million in 2001 to meet shortfalls that had arisen and were identified by the development groups.</P>
    <P>To date, there has been a relatively slow draw-down of the moneys allocated under the fund but this is expected to accelerate over the next 18 months or so when I expect that all of facilities projects will be completed. At the end of 2001, &euro;22.2 million, 43% of the overall amount allocated to date, excluding the Springboard Initiative moneys, had been drawn down by the local authorities and vocational education committees to meet the commitments incurred. This amount is made up of &euro;11.9 million in respect of capital projects and &euro;10.3 million in respect of services projects and implementation costs. This leaves a balance of &euro;28.9 million to be drawn down to meet outstanding commitments under the fund. By the end of 2003, I expect that all projects and initiatives supported under the fund to date will be completed and fully operational.</P>
    <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that WRC Consultants were engaged in April 2001 to carry out an independent evaluation of the fund. The consultants are examining the effectiveness and impact of the fund at national plan and local level and the evaluation is expected to be completed later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and congratulate him on the initiatives he is taking and the work he is doing. Does he agree that much more needs to be done and that across the country we are seeing difficulties where drug and alcohol abuse are concerned? Does he agree that in many of our cities there are no-go areas at night because of alcohol abuse, that there are young people who are afraid to go out during the day in many towns and cities, that drug abuse and misuse among young people is growing at a frightening rate and that the policy so far does not seem to be working?</P>
      <P>What evaluation of the programme has taken place to date? What action does the Minister of State propose to take given that the programme does not seem to be having the intended effect? Does he agree that young people throughout the country have very little to do at night and have nowhere to go and that we need a youth policy and to fund youth organisations to a greater extent than at present? We need trained youth workers to interact with young people but this is not happening to the extent it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of what the Deputy said. The programme is working in the areas to which the money has been allocated. Approximately 350 projects are being funded, including capital projects, 60 to 70 youth workers, sports workers and a variety of programmes. I agree with the Deputy regarding drugs and that is why we set up a national drugs strategy, which covers the entire country, and regional structures. Those regions will come up with a plan and the <Col N="275" /> type of projects the Deputy mentioned in their areas.</P>
      <P>On whether the programme is working, WRC Consultants were asked to evaluate how the programme is going and whether we are hitting the target group. They will report later this year with their findings on how it is working.</P>
      <P>I honestly believe the young people's facilities and services fund is probably one of the best programmes there is. Whether it needs to be extended around the country is an argument that needs to be looked at. From talking to people in the sector, it has proven to be a great source of funds and one which can quickly pay out. We have had a phenomenal response from people working in disadvantaged areas. It has been very positively received.</P>

      <P>Extending the programme will be the job of the next Government but it should be extended. It is a very important fund and it really does get to its target audience.</P>
      <P>We asked the consultants to ascertain if it is getting to the target group and approximately how many young people between ten and 21 are benefiting. I can only give the House anecdotal information. I have seen a great many of the projects that money from this fund went into and it has been successful. When WRC, the consultants, report to us we will have a more accurate idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 13, 23, 28, 38 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Following initial contacts between the Taoiseach and the First Minister of the Scottish Executive, I have spoken on a number of occasions with the Scottish Minister with responsibility for sport, Mike Watson, in relation to the question of a joint Irish-Scottish bid to host the European Soccer Championship Finals in 2008, including a formal meeting held in Dublin on 5 February 2002. At that meeting we discussed the various requirements and deadlines set out by UEFA, agreed that the question of a joint bid would be further explored and also agreed to establish a bid steering committee comprising representatives of the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Ireland and the Government. The bid steering committee has now been established and has already commenced its work.</P>
      <P>Following consideration at Government level, the Taoiseach confirmed to the First Minister of the Scottish Executive that Ireland is committed to supporting the preparation of a joint bid by the Scottish Football Association and the Football Association of Ireland to host the European Soccer Championship Finals in 2008. Subsequently, both football associations informed UEFA of their intention to present a formal, detailed bid document by the end of May 2002, the deadline set by UEFA. The preparation of bids to host the UEFA European championship finals is a matter for football associations. As the Irish Football Association, the governing body in Northern Ireland, is not involved in the bid, the question of a meeting the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the points made by the Minister in his reply and in his previous reply that a joint bid steering committee has been set up representing the FAI, SFA, Scottish Executive and the Government. What will be the representation on that committee from the Government and Scottish Executive? Does he feel there will be much necessity for meetings at political level to deal with problems that may arise as the bid progresses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department and I as Minister, will represent the Government on the committee while Bord Fáilte will also be represented on it. The FAI will have three members and I made it clear to them that if they wanted to appoint a fourth member I would not have any problem with that. It was normally three from the Scottish Executive and three from the Scottish FA.</P>
      <P>As regards political matters, it is now a matter entirely for UEFA. If, by 31 May, we are able to satisfy UEFA that we will have the stadiums available, they will send overseers here in September, October or November to view the available facilities. Although people have said we are in the back seat with regard to our bid to host the 2008 championships, that is not the case. If we consider the other bids we find that the Scandinavian countries have nominated their stadia but they are scattered over four countries. The Austrians and the Swiss have only one stadium, that of Grasshoppers in Zurich, with a capacity in excess of 30,000. The Scottish already have four available stadia, Celtic Park, Murrayfield, Hampden Park and Ibrox and will upgrade two more. By 2008, I am quite sure two of the three proposed stadia will be available here. It is untrue to say we are not at the races. We have jumped the second last fence and many races have been won at the second last rather than the last fence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the requirement that there must be a minimum of 30,000 permanent seats? Does he agree with me that such a requirement is detrimental in encouraging young people &ndash; such as those Deputy Eoin Ryan spoke about earlier &ndash; to attend major sporting events, who because of costs cannot pay the admission fee, nor can they go as a family? Does he agree that in stadiums such as Lansdowne Road, where it was traditional to have a young persons' section, this policy, which was very worthwhile, will be eliminated? Does the Minister agree that as Irish sporting events traditionally do not suffer from hooliganism, to have a stadium's capacity reduced from 49,000 to 30,000 &ndash; because of the ridiculous rule about permanent seating &ndash; does nothing to encourage sport, participation in sport or attendance by young people at sporting events, or those of lesser means, who cannot afford to compete with the corporate sector for seats? This is a policy on which the Government should make its voice heard internationally. These rules prevent young <Col N="278" /> people and those on lesser incomes from attending major sporting events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with the Deputy but I am also quite sure that we could make young peoples' sections available in a modern, 80,000 seater stadium. I understand such a section is available at Murrayfield. Unfortunately, it is a UEFA ruling that stadiums must have a minimum of 30,000 seats. This stems from the Hillsborough disaster and the strict safety regulations brought in afterwards. For group matches a stadium with a minimum of 30,000 seats is required while 40,000 seats for a quarter or semi final are required. The opening match and the final requires a stadium with 50,000 seats. I empathise with the Deputy. This is not something that I thought about but, perhaps, it should be brought to the international organisations' attention. Either I, or whoever may occupy this post, may bring it before them that there should be a young persons' section in the grounds.</P>

        <b>: </b>What is the estimated cost of hosting the games? Who will provide the finance? Will it be the Government or will it be funded by the FAI and SFA? Has the funding package been worked out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>To make the bids, we established a sports initiative section in Bord Fáilte which is responsible for any major international event that may be available and has the funding to make bids. Over the next seven years, there will be &euro;55 million available for such bids. It is better to organise such things on a multi-annual basis as this avoids handing out a lump sum since we can pay it in annual increments, as is being done with the Ryder Cup with &euro;500,000 per year.</P>
      <P>The FAI has made a submission to this section initially for the opening bid based on the feasibility of hosting the event. This includes other issues, such as transport, and other Departments, such as Justice, Equality and Law Reform. EUFA carries most of the cost of the competition which funds the associations in the fortunate countries, as far as I know. On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 90,000 extra visitors will come into the country for one group match, which over the three week period means a minimum of &euro;50 million spent in the Irish economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to Bord Fáilte's tourism product development scheme, which I launched at the end of January. As I have explained on a number of previous occasions, this is designed to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way, that widens the spatial spread of tourism, eases pressure on highly developed areas, and increases the lesser developed region's share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" />The scheme will be funded under the operational programmes for the Border, midlands west and south and east regions over the next five years. It will provide support for the development of major attractions, the upgrading of clusters of existing attractions and facilities, the development of special interest pursuits and also projects that will promote the better management of the relationship between tourism and the environment. In all, under this EU co-funded scheme, &euro;130 million of public sector funding has been earmarked to help lesser developed tourism areas maximise their potential, and stimulate new tourism growth areas.</P>
    <P>The launch of the scheme incorporated a public call for proposals through advertisements in the national media. Application forms and full details are available from Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism authorities, or Shannon Development in its area, to whom completed forms must be returned, I emphasise, by 22 March 2002.</P>
    <P>They will be appraised initially by the regional tourism authorities and then by Bord Fáilte before submission for decision to an independent product management board. As the launch was delayed because of difficult and protracted negotiations with the European Commission regarding State aids clearance, no grants have yet been approved under the scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>Will the Minister be more specific because what he said is general? He spoke of major attractions, existing clusters and the relationship between tourism and the environment, but will there be grants available, for example, for small hotels, the development of existing guesthouse facilities and bed-and-breakfasts? This is an important sector of the market. The large hotels, with their multi-purpose complexes and conference centres, are important revenue earners, but the traditional market is struggling &ndash; the bed-and-breakfasts, guest houses and small 20 bedroom hotels. Will the Minister tell us what kind of facilities will be eligible for grant-aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The BMW region is divided into five areas and each is entitled to provide a major attractor, upgrade clusters or provide new clusters of attractions. The problem is getting sufficient draw-down on the available funding. For example, if in Donegal we get a major attractor, that is something valued over &euro;3 million, we will also be eligible for funding to upgrade various castles, gardens, equestrian centres or any cluster of attractions. It is hoped that using this scheme to attract people to an area will benefit small hotels and bed and breakfast establishments. People no longer visit a specific area for the sake of getting a comfortable bed. They want to go to an area which has attractions, particularly for children. During the foot and mouth disease crisis people complained that they were asked to holiday at home, but there was nothing for their children to do. That is true. This is an opportunity <Col N="281" /> for local authorities, regional tourism authorities and people in general to come together with a view to bringing forward ideas to attract people into their areas, thereby benefiting the hotel sector and bed and breakfast and guest house establishments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past 30 years, the Border region was unable to attract any tourism. In my own county of Monaghan, for instance, guest houses, small hotels etc. suffered greatly during that period yet it is difficult for them to draw down any funds under the current structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the BMW region as an example. The south and east region is also divided into five or six different regions. I understand Deputy Deenihan's area is in the same region as Limerick and Kerry North. There is a south and east region and a BMW region and they are sub-divided further. All the information is available in a pack from Bord Fáilte of which the Deputy can avail. In terms of previous funding, £60 million &ndash; I do not know the figure in euro &ndash; went to the south and east region and £40 million went to the BMW region.</P>
      <P>On the Leader groups, it is open to anybody to put forward proposals. For example, an individual can put forward a proposal to set up an equestrian centre or a water sports centre as long as it is regarded as an attraction. In my own area, for example, Glenveagh Castle, Doe Castle and some of the equestrian centres would come together and put forward a submission for funding of &euro;2 million, &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I might try to get the time limit extended. I agree 22 March is a little short, but we were held back in that regard. The Deputy must remember that a detailed proposal is not needed by 22 March, only an indication of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Crawford that the Border region has suffered. We have had 30 years of instability along the Border because of the troubles perpetrated on a daily basis by different organisations, and the Deputy's county and my county have felt the effect of the dearth of investment over those 30 years. We are only playing catch-up with the rest of the country in that <Col N="282" /> regard, but this represents a great opportunity and I hope the people in the Monaghan area and the local regional tourism authority will make an application for funding. It will be available for five years and I hope we will have a major attraction in each area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8, 14, 24, 35, 50 and 534 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Irish tourism industry suffered its first major setback in a decade in 2001 with the impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis in the spring and, in the autumn, the fall off in business arising from the events of 11 September. The most recent CSO figures cover <Col N="283" /> only the first nine months of the year and indicate that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland in that period dropped by 6% on the same period in 2000 to 4.55 million. Despite this drop in numbers, total earnings from all overseas visits in the first nine months, including receipts paid to Irish carriers and cross-Border revenue, increased by 5.5% to &euro;3.06 billion.</P>
    <P>Official CSO statistics for the year 2001 as a whole will not be available until the middle of this year. However, Bord Fáilte estimates the number of overseas visitors to Ireland may have declined by about 7% in 2001 to 5.8 million but expenditure by overseas visitors is estimated to have increased by 4% to &euro;3.8 billion. Also, on a positive note, domestic holiday business remained buoyant last year, with expenditure rising by 16% according to latest Bord Fáilte estimates. Last year, Irish people took 7.2 million trips in Ireland, an increase of 10.7% on 2000. This helped offset the downturn in overseas visitors, in particular towards the back end of the year.</P>
    <P>On the employment front, the CERT business and employment survey 2001 indicated 2,000 permanent job losses, with an additional 6,000 seasonal-part-time losses compared with the previous year. However, 60% of respondents in the survey expect business in 2002 to be the same this year as in 2001. A total of 82% of businesses expect employment levels to be maintained at 2001 levels and only 10% of respondents are projecting staff reductions with most of the job losses being seasonal in nature.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt but that 2002 will be a challenging year for Irish tourism. Tourism Ireland Limited, the new all-island tourism marketing company which was successfully launched in Dublin and Belfast last November, is projecting a best case scenario for 2002 of a return to 2000 business levels, generally regarded as an excellent year for Irish tourism. This equates to an increase in the number of British visitors of 10%, growth of at least 6% in visitor numbers from mainland Europe and a minimisation of any further loss of traffic from North America.</P>
    <P>The out-turn of expenditure by my Department for general tourism marketing purposes, including Bord Fáilte operating costs, is set out in the Estimates volumes for the years in question. The position may be summarised as follows:</P>

        <b>: </b>I thank the Minister for his reply but he did not reply to Question No. 7, which asked about the amounts made available by his Department for tourism promotion and marketing. He gave us many statistics, but it would take a lot of statistics to convince people in the tourist sector that a 7% decline has led to an increase in revenue. However, we can debate that matter another day.</P>
      <P>Where will the emphasis be in terms of marketing and promotion? What initiatives or additional measures have been put in place to attract British tourists who were asked not to come here last year because of the foot and mouth disease crisis? The &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; slogans on walls have disappeared with the advent of the peace process. There are much cheaper fuel costs here than in the United Kingdom. The currency exchange rate between Britain and Ireland could make Ireland an attractive destination for British tourists. Having regard to all that, where is the emphasis, what is the focus and what additional measures have been put in place to attract back British tourists, many of whom unfortunately have considered Ireland a &ldquo;no go&rdquo; area for the past 20 to 30 years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I said it is estimated that we are trying to get a 10% plus increase in British visitors in the coming year. I agree with the Deputy that the British market has suffered tremendously particularly as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis. We were rightly focusing on the United States because the higher spending visitor came from the United States. Unfortunately the United States market has been slow to pick up. Flights from here to the United States are full, but the return flights are half empty. Anyone who works at Dublin Airport would confirm that. The focus, therefore, must now be on the British market and other European markets. Relevant surveys show that of all travellers, the Americans, the British, the French and the Germans account for 40% of the total spent by tourists. Ireland is in an ideal position, given the number of people who claim to be second, third, fourth and fifth generation Irish on one side of the Atlantic and our close <Col N="285" /> proximity to the UK, France and Germany. The French and German markets have been extremely sluggish. If the foot and mouth disease crisis did anything, it made us realise that while there are 350 million people in the United States, there are also 350 million people in Europe, yet the number of tourists from the two destinations are not similar. We get only one million visitors from Europe. We are focusing on the British market for all the reasons the Deputy set out.</P>

      <P>In view of the major drop of 770,000 visitors to this country last year against the target set in the national development plan and the loss of about 10,000 jobs, much more should be spent on marketing Ireland this year to win back the market. I understand the marketing budget of Bord Fáilte will be used up by the end of April and there will be no visible marketing of Ireland by Bord Fáilte in the UK market or in the USA after April. The UK has made £20 million available to its tourism board and the French have made &euro;12 million to their tourism board in additional to the amounts in their estimates. The British and the French, our main competitors, are providing the necessary extra funding for tourism because the market is becoming very competitive, but we, however, are cutting back on this area. A recent ITIC report states that less money is available for marketing this country this year than was available in 2001.</P>

      <P>This small country made an extra &euro;13 million available last year. I am aware of the position that will pertain after April. I met representatives of ITIC recently. They made a sub<Col N="286" /> mission for an extra &euro;20 million, which I am examining. I had a good discussion with them on that occasion and told them that the largest marketing budget in the history of the State will go into marketing this year. More than &euro;50 million will be used by Bord Fáilte, &euro;27 million will be used by Tourism Ireland on marketing alone and &euro;5 million has been spent on a TV series for broadcasting on television abroad. All that funding has gone on marketing this country. I am aware that the marketing budget will be used up by April. The Deputy must remember that the bulk of the marketing of a country is done in the early part of the year or in the previous November-December. That is nothing new. All the funding on marketing must be spent in the earlier part of the year. I asked Tourism Ireland to examine ways in which the marketing spend could be spent.</P>

        <b>: </b>I welcome the marketing initiative and the additional funding for tourism promotion, which are important from the point of view of selling Ireland. That is the way to go. Rather than the global advertising of this country on radio, television in newspapers and so on, which is important, is there any change in Bord Fáilte's approach in terms of going into sectoral interest areas? I am talking about going into angling clubs and selling fishing, going into golf clubs and selling golf, going to interest groups such as those and selling the country on a one to one basis because once one attracts those types of interest groups to come here, one has that market forever. We need to be able to talk golf to the golfers, angling and fishing to the anglers and so on, particularly in Britain. Is there any change of emphasis or focus in that direction by Bord Fáilte? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. I agree with the Deputy on this issue. It is all about the experience a visitor has when he or she comes to this country. We are bringing people over, introducing them to Irish culture and life and letting them get a feel for it rather than telling them about it. We have so many brochures that we could fill 50 articulated trucks that would block the route from O'Connell Street to Dublin Port, if not out to Dún Laoghaire. Everyone is focused <Col N="287" /> on the idea of brochures. When one leaves an aeroplane and comes into the airport one sees many brochures. Does anyone ever look through them? If there was only one, a person might pick it up, but one is faced with many of them and a great deal of money is spent on them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's idea is correct. I have emphasised that approach to Bord Fáilte on many occasions, the importance of bringing people over here and giving them an experience, particularly people who are in media. I am considering a suggestion of how one can sell a country to a huge audience, which I came across on the Discovery channel at 7 p.m. on Sunday night. Getting the message across in that manner is far better than by way of brochures.</P>
      <P>With regard to the angling experience, if a guy gets up at 4 a.m. goes out and catches a fish, comes in and cooks it, he will bring that story back home and that message goes far further than the audience one would reach by an article in a brochure stating that we have the best angling in this country. Words ending in &ldquo;st&rdquo; should be removed from the marketing of the country, phrases such as we are best, the first and the utmost at doing this. People are tired of hearing that. The Deputy's proposal of bringing people in niche areas, particularly those in angling, over here is a good one. There is major potential to develop the angling industry. The River Moy is worth &euro;10 million to the people in that area. That is the type of marketing I would like to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that, with the funds made available last year, there was success in winning back some of the market at the end of the year, surely it makes sense that if one spends on the market after April visitors will come to Ireland. I understand a submission has been made to the Minister for &euro;20 million which would be money well spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The experiment worked well last year and we are considering the funding requested by ITIC. It worked particularly in the UK market. However, I am still not convinced the Americans are prepared to move. While there is an idea that the economy there is recovering, nonetheless even business people are stagnant in their approach. If there is to be a boost it will come from the leisure centre, through imaginative marketing and the different packages offered. We have discussed in the past who is a visitor and who is a holiday maker. Any boost in air travel will come from the leisure sector as opposed to the business sector because of the imaginative packages being made available. While the experiment has worked there is a limitation on the resources. I do not like talking about figures but we put a great deal of funds into the industry. I shall convey the point raised by the Deputy to Paul O'Toole of Tourism Ireland. We have discussed with Tourism Ireland various print media <Col N="288" /> in which we should get involved. There are new innovative ideas but they all take funding.</P>

        <b>: </b>In regard to the cutbacks in Aer Lingus, 33% of its staff have been shed. It has withdrawn a considerable number of transatlantic flights and has done away with the marketing arm. It has to be acknowledged that long before Bord Fáilte got into the business, Aer Lingus was not only selling Aer Lingus, it was selling Ireland and doing so very aggressively. Ireland and Aer Lingus were synonymous with each other. Does the Minister regret that Aer Lingus has decided to displace the personnel in the marketing section? Given that those personnel were professional and very good at the job, it is unfortunate, in the context of the cutbacks, that this element of the service has been culled and taken out of existence.</P>

      <P>Naturally one would regret that any element of marketing has been taken out of existence. The idea in setting up the Tourism Marketing Partnership was to bring the industry into line with Bord Fáilte When I came into office, I found a great divide between Bord Fáilte and the industry. Bord Fáilte was spending an arm and a leg on marketing while the industry was also spending in this area, and there was a great deal of overlap. The Tourism Marketing Partnership has brought all that together. While &euro;50 million will be spent by Bord Fáilte this year, it is estimated that the industry will invest &euro;100 million. While all the air and sea carriers have marketed themselves, they have marketed Ireland also. Any loss in this area would be felt greatly.</P>

      <P>I have seen the results of the recent Bord Fáilte visitor attitude survey for 2001 and I am pleased to see that Ireland is still highly rated by our visitors and that we are continuing to deliver holidays that match our customers' high expectations. We surpassed the expectations of one third of our visitors &ndash; just 4% expressed disappointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the survey, more than 50% of all holidaymakers are satisfied with all-round value for money. British and American visitors, who benefit from strong currencies, were particularly satisfied. While the overall satisfaction rate has improved on that five years ago, Bord Fáilte has identified a worrying trend among mainland <Col N="289" /> European visitors. A number of years ago, there were some concerns about value for money among German visitors and this has begun to filter through to other European markets, particularly the Netherlands and Italy. According to Bord Fáilte, this can be partly attributed to the downturn in the global economy combined with an increasing cost base in Ireland. The areas most criticised in respect of value for money were eating out and the price of alcohol. Car hire and the cost of access to the country are rated more positively on value for money than five years ago.</P>
    <P>Increasing the number of visitors from continental European markets is a priority for Tourism Ireland Limited this year. In looking to mainland Europe as a source of potential growth, the industry must be extremely conscious of the new competitive environment that has come with the new single currency. Most of our key European target markets are in the euro zone and there is greater price transparency between Ireland and these source markets, as well as competing holiday destinations.</P>
    <P>To help emerging price pressures in the labour market, CERT has been developing programmes which focus on improving productivity and human resource management in the sector.</P>
    <P>Many tourism businesses have readjusted their marketing and pricing strategies to secure extra business in the current difficult climate. I urge companies to improve their competitiveness and keep prices as attractive as possible. In particular, I welcome recent attractively priced offers from air and sea carriers, which have been to the forefront in this area, accommodation providers and others, which should help to improve our competitiveness and our image as a value for money destination.</P>

      <P>In the past three years much dissatisfaction has been expressed regarding the prices charged for services provided, which have increased from 12% to 22%. In lower grade hotels the dissatisfaction rate has risen from 10% to 16%. Another issue that gives rise to dissatisfaction is the quality of roads and road signage. The Minister has indicated some of the measures being taken. Given the Minister's response, I am of the view that there is an acceptance that these problems will continue and will be difficult to address. Given that we have an excellent tourism product, which we seek to sell to our European colleagues, it is vitally important that these trends are addressed and reversed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the value for money part of my portfolio. I have said previously that people do not have a problem with paying for quality. We have quality. The word &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; is being used more and more in the Irish context. If Ireland becomes known as a high cost destination, unfortunately all the work and funding put into tourism will be wasted and it will be difficult to get those markets back. It has been stated that one does not get value for money in <Col N="290" /> food and bar prices. That speaks for itself, and I have always expressed that concern. Deputy Higgins asked why a 7% decrease in visitor figures has led to a 1% increase in revenue. There are two ways that can come about, visitors to Ireland are spending a great deal more or they are being charged more, but that is debatable. We have received complaints about roads and signage, particularly with regard to ports. My Department has asked local authorities to try to make arrangements in relation to these problems.</P>

      <P>&ndash;the introduction of improved management procedures and enhanced protocols for hospital management of patient care.</P>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputies Rabbitte and O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has tabled this motion as a demonstration of its concern for the perilous state of accident and emergency departments. Patients often have to wait for hours to be seen and days may pass before they are given a bed. A recent report showed that hundreds of patients are on trolleys in accident and emergency departments at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When asked in the House for a response to the recent crisis when Beaumont Hospital was forced to turn away ambulances, the Taoiseach tried to play down its seriousness by pointing out that it was not an unusual occurrence. It is tragically true that the crisis in accident and emergency departments is not new, but it has deepened in <Col N="292" /> the past five years. The Taoiseach should not be using these facts as an excuse, as they are an indictment of a Government which cannot, or will not, live up to its responsibilities. It is clear the Taoiseach's priorities are focused elsewhere. If the Government had tried to solve the problems in the health service in as dedicated a manner as it approached yesterday's abortion referendum, the sick and the elderly may have seen a real and significant improvement in their health. The nightmare in accident and emergency wards continues, however. The prolonged nature and scale of this crisis is hard evidence that after five years in office the Government has failed abysmally to provide quality health care for patients and a fair deal for staff.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office, it undertook to tackle waiting lists in hospitals. Money has been dedicated to that end, but we have not seen the desired results. Commitments have been made by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, but waiting lists are as long as ever. They increased under this Administration at first and have since been reduced, but their overall profile has not changed significantly, despite the additional funds. About 70 review groups of different kinds have been set up by the Government in its five years in office, but basic hospital services are over stretched</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot keep up. With a general election looming, the Government has pinned its hopes on an overblown health strategy, but it has failed to provide the funding needed if the plan is to live up to its hype. The Taoiseach said at the launch of the strategy last November that he was resolved to focus on long-term solutions rather than quick fixes, but we have not seen any evidence of such an approach. It was clear within days of the announcement of the strategy that the Government had not made any funding commitments beyond the end of the current year. The practical application of the health strategy means that people on low incomes who are just above the medical card limit will be offered no help or support. The Government insists on concentrating the provision of medical cards on those over 70, even though we know those in that age group who are in the top 20% of earners will receive the benefits. I have no problem with extending the medical card scheme, but I believe all people should get free GP care at the point of delivery. The Government made a deliberate decision in favour of wealthier people over 70 and against poorer low income families who are just above medical card limits. The health strategy is meaningless to the latter group as it has nothing to offer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister for Health and Children, much needed measures to deal with prob<Col N="293" /> lems in accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals can only be introduced if the cost of such initiatives can be met within current resources. Any reasonable person would take that as an indication that improvements in accident and emergency wards will mean a withdrawal of funding from, and less improvement in, other health services. The struggle between competing needs is most acute in emergency wards. The solution to overcrowding is often to cancel elective procedures, but the knock-on effect is that patients on waiting lists for treatment are pushed further down the line to make way for emergency cases. This happens to an increasing number of people and the solution must be to meet both needs. We should endeavour to manage and resource the health service to provide for those who need emergency care, without denying those who are entitled to other forms of care.</P>
    <P>The stark comments of Dr. Patrick Plunkett, an accident and emergency consultant at St. James's Hospital, sum up the Government's failure. He explained at a recent press conference that he resigned from the hospital's board of management because he could not accept that poor, sick and aged people who are too sick to be sent home should have to lie on trolleys in public corridors for hours or days because elective admissions are given precedence. Last Monday, 22 patients were on trolleys in the accident and emergency department of the hospital, waiting for beds in wards. Dr. Plunkett said that one such patient had been waiting for an emergency bed in a psychiatric hospital since the previous Friday. The fact that a new generation of doctors is learning to examine patients on busy thoroughfares in full view of other patients and passers-by is, according to Dr. Plunkett, a sad deterioration in professional standards. This may be acceptable after an earthquake has levelled a hospital, but in Ireland in the 21st century it is a cause of shame.</P>
    <P>One of the factors regarding the health service from which we have always taken solace and a certain amount of comfort is the high professional standards of medical and nursing staff. However, in conditions such as those described by Dr. Plunkett it is impossible for those high professional standards to be maintained. The point he makes is that it is unsustainable to expect that high level of professionalism to pertain in such a poor environment and in such working conditions.</P>
    <P>Even more shameful is the evidence given by nurses working at the coal face on a daily basis who are struggling to cope with a deepening crisis. In SIPTU's submission published recently the experience of one nurse is truly harrowing. This nurse spent one night watching over an accident victim so she could claim the bed when the time came for another patient in her care. The victim was a young, 28 year old man who she knew was about to die. This nurse stated that all she wished to do was to care for this patient in <Col N="294" /> his last moments. She did not wish to watch over him in order to claim his bed.</P>
    <P>Another psychiatric nurse brought an elderly patient from a psychiatric hospital to an accident and emergency unit because the patient needed urgent attention. The nurse was severely rebuked by a doctor on duty because the unit was already overcrowded and she had to leave in tears. For these nurses who already work in a stressful environment, fears for their safety have become a growing issue. SIPTU and the INO are calling for proper security provisions to make accident and emergency departments safe places in which to work. A key demand is the immediate introduction of measures to enhance security within these departments, including, where required, improved lighting, closed circuit television, security doors and the presence of security personnel 24 hours a day, seven days a week. These demands tell us all we need to know about the circumstances in which professionally trained people are trying to deal with emergency cases which come into over loaded departments. Is it any wonder that nurses have decided to take industrial action given the overcrowded conditions in which patients sleep on trolleys and in which nurses are constantly under pressure and often face aggression. More than 90% of nurses balloted voted to take this action. Striking is not something they set out to do. There has been only one nurses' strike which was taken under equally difficult conditions. It is significant that, in this case, the issue is not about pay or conditions, but the needs of patients and the capability and capacity of the hospital service to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this threatened industrial action is prevented and pre-empted by the Minister for Health and Children. He must seize the opportunity which the nurses have given him by delaying their action until 13 March. He has time to implement a clear set of measures to tackle the fundamental deficiencies in the accident and emergency service which he has so far failed to address.</P>
    <P>An analysis carried out by Geraldine Regan and published in an accident and emergency nursing publication two years ago outlined the main reasons delays in these departments were so lengthy. In her research interviewees saw the main cause as the high proportion of inexperienced junior medical staff. The crisis in hospitals is only added to where junior staff in accident and emergency departments are ill-equipped or insufficiently trained to cope. Patients must be assured that they have access to consultant care when needed.</P>
    <P>Another problem which was clearly identified, and which is still unresolved despite the Minister's announcements, is the shortage of beds. We have to ask why, after five years of economic buoyancy in which health spending doubled, people are still forced to wait, often in pain and distress, in accident and emergency departments before they can see a doctor. People often have <Col N="295" /> to wait to get into a cubicle, then wait again to be admitted or forwarded to another department or hospital.</P>
    <P>An article in today's edition of <i>The Mirror</i> highlights the case of a young Kerryman who was kicked unconscious on the streets of Killarney and who was taken to Tralee General Hospital. On arrival it was discovered that he had severe head injuries and was soaked in blood. However, because there was no head trauma specialist available, he was forced to wait on a trolley in the accident and emergency department corridor for 15 hours, from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. During this time he continued to remain soaked in blood and in much pain.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Health and Children tell the House if this is the kind of health service over which he stands? Why was this young man &ndash; an innocent victim of a brutal attack &ndash; left to suffer even further because this Government has failed to upgrade, resource and where necessary, redesign accident and emergency services? The requirements have been set out by the INO and SIPTU and have been itemised by medical practitioners working in the field who have continually pointed out what needs to be done, and where, to improve accident and emergency services. We need more consultants, anaesthetic facilities, endoscopy services, facilities for minor surgery and general practitioner services. However, in addition there is a clear direction in terms of better management which must be spearheaded by the Minister who is ultimately responsible. He can transfer blame and responsibility to the health boards, hospital management and so on, but at the end of the day the buck lands on his desk. He has to take a real and effective initiative in this regard.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of hospitals with accident and emergency departments must be central to whatever management changes and reorganisations are required. Long before now we should have seen the implementation of measures such as the restructuring of the role of nurses, the greater use of nurse practitioners, a more efficient admission and discharge policy in accident and emergency units and improved liaison measures between hospital and community services.</P>
    <P>This issue has not arisen out of nowhere and this crisis should not come as a surprise to anyone. The Government is almost five years in office. We have just come through what I imagine has been a painful experience for many women, particularly those who experienced crisis pregnancies and who went to Britain for abortions. That experience demanded a great deal of resources, time and energy from the Minister to whom I pay tribute as he did not shirk his duty. He was willing to debate the issue on any occasion. Unfortunately, the Taoiseach was not as willing to do likewise. Considerable resources and energies were put into this issue by the Minister and his officials to try and drive through an <Col N="296" /> abortion referendum which was unnecessary and unnecessarily divisive. That energy and those resources should have gone into dealing with the crisis in our accident and emergency departments which are affecting patients &ndash; the born of this country, the elderly and the sick.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons what is happening in accident and emergency departments is not forgotten is because it does not matter whether one is rich or poor, if one needs that kind of care one goes to such a department. Even Charlie Haughey ended up availing of such a department. If we had private departments we probably would not know half of what is going on. However, we do not have private accident and emergency departments so everyone goes to a public hospital when necessary. Most people who attend such departments point out that the nurses and medical staff are great, but that they are overworked and the conditions are often appalling. There is genuine shock that at a time when this country is so financially secure that we have a Taoiseach dreaming about national stadia and changing the Constitution in totally unnecessary ways, we cannot get the floors of our accident and emergency departments swept clean or have units upgraded and staffed to meet the needs of poor, sick and vulnerable people. Those people need the Minister's attention but, so far, have not got it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more typical of the Members of the House than Deputy McManus in approaching this debate. She is something of an expert in the area whereas I am merely the recipient in clinics and elsewhere of heart-rending complaints from those who have direct experience of the accident and emergency service. It is difficult to understand how, after seven years of unprecedented boom, the accident and emergency services are as Deputy McManus described them.</P>
      <P>The staff frustration is perfectly understandable. I hope the dispute in this area is resolved but I understand why staff of all categories working in these circumstances would wish to express their frustration in this way as a final resort. Recently I wrote to the Minister about a case from the midlands, where the person ended up in the accident and emergency unit of St. James's Hospital on a Friday night. It might be because the person concerned was from the midlands, but he was absolutely appalled by the environment in which he found himself. I do not understand how nurses and other staff can cope with these circumstances in a major acute hospital in cities at the weekend. After waiting for five hours, the person concerned discharged himself, if that is the correct word, because he despaired of being attended. He feared for his safety because of the fights and arguments taking place in the accident and emergency department at that hour between people who were drunk or addicted to drugs, worsening the already excruciating situation for those queuing for attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that Beaumont Hospital had to issue a protection warning two weeks ago that it was <Col N="297" /> unable to cope with further admissions is extraordinary. Some 59 patients were already waiting for attention &ndash; more than three times the capacity. Ambulances had to circle as a flight would have to circle Dublin Airport if air traffic control required it. Tallaght Hospital is developing a fine reputation but the problem for people on the street is that, while it is a fine hospital, they cannot get into it for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>One third of patients who get into accident and emergency units wait longer than six hours. Are there no remedial measures the Minister can take to deal with this problem? Why can he not put GPs into accident and emergency departments? Different categories of complaint cause people to present at accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus dealt with the implications of the health card and people using the accident and emergency service because they cannot afford to see their GP. The old system of the triage nurse defining the gravity of the category would allow a situation where minor categories could be referred to a GP doing sessions in the accident and emergency departments of our major city hospitals, while more serious categories could be referred to a surgeon or physician. Management of non-emergency cases is critical in gaining respite. That happened with some success in St. James's Hospital but this phenomenon in accident and emergency departments is predominantly city based.</P>
    <P>Some GPs have come to rely on the accident and emergency services or the radio doctor to an extent. That clearly contributes to the situation where the throughput in the accident and emergency departments cannot be attended to. The whole question of the accident and emergency service supporting primary care will have to be examined by the Minister. He must talk to the GPs about it.</P>
    <P>In provincial areas, the opposite is the case. There is no accident and emergency consultant in the hospital in Ennis. In such a situation, highly trained, professionally qualified, non-national doctors, who are not necessarily specialists in the area, have to deal with patients. This gives rise to an issue with paediatrics that must be addressed separately. There can be a very highly qualified doctor, a specialist in his own area, on duty who is not comfortable with a child presenting with what could be a serious problem. I do not understand why the consultants the Minister has announced for accident and emergency departments are temporary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we devolved too many statutory powers and not enough accountability. I was disturbed yesterday to meet a manager who told me that she was recently an applicant for a post in an agency. Someone at the top of the agency came to the conclusion that a professional manager was required, rather than a physician, and advertised accordingly. This person is satisfied that the only reason she did not get the post was that she did not come from inside. Some chap who came up through the system concluded she would not be able to talk to consultants.</P>
      <P>There must be a problem with management in the health services. I do not understand why, while financial investment in the health services is doubled, the problems also double. There must be a problem with the calibre and quality of the management. It would be desirable for the Minister to encourage a system where managers from the private sector are brought in to shake up some of the habits within the system.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister does not require private hospitals to provide an accident and emergency facility. Insurers of private cover, whether it be BUPA, the VHI or whoever, should be required to make the necessary investment to ensure the Blackrock Clinic and other private hospitals provide an accident and emergency service. It is intolerable for working class people and others to be obliged to queue for attention in accident and emergency departments. The Minister must address the problem with a greater degree of urgency. He says his proposals offer a great deal of promise but he must produce more imaginative solutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for sharing time with me. It is shameful that nurses have been driven to call strike action to draw attention to the crisis in accident and emergency departments. If it was not for their dedication, nursing and medical staff would be leaving the service in droves. It is old fashioned to refer to vocations but nurses have a genuine vocation. They are so committed to their chosen careers to look after the sick they are willing to put up with a great deal of hard work and difficulty. However, they have been driven by frustration to take their present action. While he may not say it publicly, I believe the Minister would agree with Deputy McManus when she said he would have been much better using his time over the past few months addressing these issues rather than dealing with the divisive abortion referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a crisis in accident and emergency departments of hospitals. Sick patients must wait <Col N="299" /> for hours on trolleys. Deputy McManus outlined specific cases that illustrate the depth of the crisis. It is frightening enough to be sick and in hospital without having to wait in uncomfortable accident and emergency departments in the absence of adequate diagnosis and not knowing when and where treatment will commence. Given the state of the public finances, it is shameful that this situation persists.</P>
    <P>We must address the basic problems, which are clearly outlined in the motion. These include the provision of additional staff and resources, the opening of additional community beds to ease the pressure on accident and emergency departments and the introduction of improved management procedures and enhanced protocols for hospital management and patient care. They will not be addressed by endless long-term reports and so on. They must be tackled now. If the Minister spoke to the front line staff in accident and emergency departments&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;he would learn more than from any number of reports that have appeared.</P>
      <P>One of the problems is that to access the acute hospitals, virtually all patients must first go through the accident and emergency departments where they are filtered to the different departments. The system covers a spectrum of patients, from those involved in acute road accidents, those with minor cuts and suspected fractures, a growing number of suicidal young people, those with suspected heart trouble to the chronic elderly referred by GPs because they have become too sick to stay at home. That leads to bad management and it is surprising it has not been previously addressed. These patients are often seen at a time when senior management and consultants have gone home. It means they are being dealt with by relatively inexperienced hospital staff with the result that often difficulties arise in making management decisions. A different type of admissions system is required to ensure that patients can be referred directly to the part of the hospital where they will get treatment.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for a more interactive system with GPs. I live in the same house as a GP and I have often heard the telephone calls in the middle of night. Even where a GP refers a patient he knows very well, the patient must queue in the accident and emergency system as if he or she had arrived without referral That does not amount to a proper use of the GP service.</P>
      <P>There is a need for more consultants, although I take the point about Comhairle na nOspidéal. There is a very low ratio of accident and emergency consultants. Many more nurses are also required. There is also a need to break down the management hierarchies in hospitals. At present there can be management structures covering administrators, doctors and nurses who tend not to interact. It is an ineffective system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" />More needs to be done to keep patients out and move patients on who do not need to be in acute hospitals. This will involve closer co-operation with GPs. There is a need for move-on facilities to help patients who are ready to move to step-down facilities. The shortage of long-stay beds for the elderly is scandalous. We have known for a long time about the growth in the population of the elderly and the Ombudsman reported on the state of nursing homes over a year ago. St. Camillus's hospital has closed long-stay beds in recent years in an attempt to balance resources. Such decisions should not be forced on health boards. If space is to be made available in acute hospitals there must be a system to ensure that those who do not need to be there can move on in a simple way. Rather than oblige people to seek unaffordable nursing homes, public long-stay beds should be made available.</P>
    <P>The health system continues to be under resourced. We have one of the lowest number of beds <i>per capita</i> of all EU countries and our GDP expenditure on health places us in the lower half of member states. The Minister acknowledges that we have not reached the levels of expenditure in other EU countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of young school students want to be nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and many of the other classes of expertise required by hospitals but many of them cannot access third level courses. Last year a mother of a leaving certificate student told me her daughter only wanted to be a nurse but she had not got the necessary qualifying points. At the same time there are shortages in nursing which would be even more acute if nurses were not so dedicated. There are many easier and better paid careers for them. We have been very slow to integrate the educational system with the needs of the health care system. A minimum of 500 points in the leaving certificate is required to access courses in physiotherapy, occupational therapy or speech therapy. While it is the intention to introduce new courses next year it is a much too delayed response to current needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spending on the elderly is still too low at a time when we know the dependent elderly population is growing. The Minister may have heard about a lot of these issues before, but what is needed is a genuine response to the practical problems which have been identified by nurses. The welfare of sick people is paramount. If major structural changes in the management systems are needed, if it means getting more funding from the Department of Finance for resources, if it means banging heads together in third level institutions to ensure we train appropriate numbers of staff or if it means recruiting from outside the country in the short-term, then we will have to do those things. We cannot stand over a system where patients are coming in their droves into accident and <Col N="301" /> emergency departments which cannot cope. Nurses will leave if this is not addressed and we will have a much bigger crisis than that which already exists if numbers in nursing staff are reduced further.</P>
    <P>There is no time to look to the medium term, although the Minister must do so, as there are immediate crisis situations which need to be addressed. I hope this motion receives an urgent response from the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> I thank Deputy McManus and the Labour Party for tabling a motion relating to health for one of this Dail's final Private Members' debates. A core objective for our health services must be the development of accident and emergency services which are of the highest quality and are relieved of the unreasonable pressures their staff often face. Achieving this objective will take a wide series of initiatives, involving primary care, staffing, new facilities and many other areas.</P>
    <P>The blueprint for this series of initiatives is in place and action is under way. All my discussions with the groups responsible for implementation have been very constructive. In contrast, being constructive is unfortunately one the qualities generally absent from the Opposition's approach to these issues. I particularly welcome this debate because it gives another opportunity to show the contrast between the empty rhetoric of some politicians concerned only with an ever more desperate and distant hope of getting into power and the substance of a programme of investment and reform which will deliver the quality and fairness which our people so rightly demand of their health service.</P>
    <P>During the two and a half years I have had the honour of serving in the Department of Health and Children, the approach of the Opposition parties has been absolutely consistent. They publish their motions a few days beforehand and sometimes get their denunciations in early through media appearances. On every occasion the debate is opened with a carefully choreographed series of attacks, many of which fail to mention any positive proposal whatsoever. One particularly creative part of the Opposition's ritual on these occasions involves anyone who dares to reply directly to their attacks, or to question their vague and undetailed proposals being accused of a wide range of ever more grievous sins. These new champions of the interests of patients always manage to leave one thing out of their lengthy contributions &ndash; they never explain and never apologise for their abject record. The Opposition's concern for health is something which materialised from nowhere a couple of years ago, faster than you could say &ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo;. Since then everything has been driven by the same motivation.</P>
    <P>In preparation for this evening's debate, I asked to see a copy of what the Labour Party's extensive policy documents have to say about accident and emergency services. The House will recall that the Labour Party has spent a lot of time praising itself for producing what it claims is a blueprint to cure our ills. Two years ago, Deputy McManus published the first document promising to follow it up with legislation and detailed costings. Late last year we saw the second instalment, which was billed as a more detailed contribution. This managed the almost impossible task of having less detail and containing more basic contradictions than the first. We still await with bated breath how the Deputy will explain the promise to keep all facilities fully <Col N="303" /> operational, yet require all facilities to compete for their funding from insurers.</P>
    <P>In relation to accident and emergency, the area which the Labour Party has shown so much concern for tonight, this was completely absent from its first &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; policy. Last year's Labour Party document &ldquo;Our Good Health&rdquo; gave us a brave new vision for accident and emergency. The policy amounts to one proposal, worth quoting in full: Accident and emergency departments will be strengthened where necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The contrast between this and the detailed plans we have published and are implementing is quite dramatic.</P>
      <P>Our accident and emergency departments are often the place where key shortcomings in the rest of our health system come together. The lack of effective primary care teams in much of the country, the lack of capacity for elective admissions and an historic failure to invest in facilities and personnel all combine to impact on accident and emergency departments. The fact that 70% of all admissions now come through accident and emergency departments is the most dramatic demonstration that major investment and reform is required. Dealing with these issues does not require a single initiative &ndash; a series of interrelated initiatives are required, together with a sustained period of investment and that is what we are delivering.</P>
      <P>A key step in lifting the pressure from accident and emergency is to develop the capacity of our acute hospital system. The Government has recognised this and is taking action. The health strategy, &ldquo;Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for you&rdquo;, which we published last year outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services starting immediately which will stretch over the next decade. As part of the preparation work for the strategy, we conducted the first comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs for many years. The last health strategy in 1994 had no such bed capacity review or plan. This is the first health strategy to focus on that key issue.</P>
      <P>On foot of that review, &ldquo;Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review&rdquo;, which I published in early January, the Government has put in place a programme to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This will be the largest bed capacity expansion in the history of our health services.</P>
      <P>I announced on 16 January this year a &euro;65 million investment package in the current year for the commissioning of 709 of these 3,000 beds in acute hospitals and these will come on stream within the next 12 months. There are 55 in Deputy O'Sullivan's constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ready for the last two years.</P>

    <Col N="304" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident that once these beds are put in place there will be a significant improvement in the accident and emergency services. The provision of these extra beds will increase the capacity of the hospitals to facilitate the admission of patients awaiting admission through accident and emergency departments and will also help to facilitate reductions in waiting times for these patients.</P>
      <P>In the wider non-acute setting the Government is committed in the strategy to major investment in services which will relieve pressures currently faced by our accident and emergency departments. A major re-focus on primary care services marked by the introduction of a new model of care involving a core inter-disciplinary primary care team, which will work with a wider network of health and social care professionals and which will offer 24 hour cover to patients, will help to reduce demand from and treat appropriately patients who would otherwise have to attend at an accident and emergency department. This sector will therefore take on a pivotal role in helping to reduce pressures in accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>Our vision for primary care is a bold one which will represent a dramatic improvement both in the quality of care available and in the effective utilisation of vital health professionals. It will provide a more stable and supportive working environment and maximise the impact of early intervention and preventative work. We will also push on with a major programme of developing community care facilities, ensuring that people who often have no alternative to hospital can be cared for in more appropriate and effective facilities.</P>
      <P>The lack of sufficient capacity and primary care have a particular impact during the winter period when patients often have to wait for long periods before being admitted to an available bed. I will outline to the House a range of important initiatives which are being supported by the Government to improve service in accident and emergency departments. Among these initiatives was the provision last year of a &euro;40 million investment package aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients over the winter period. This investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including approval to recruit 29 additional accident and emergency consultants as well as additional anaesthetists. There are 12 in place and there is funding for an additional 13. Reference was made to their temporary nature but that was due to the fact that Comhairle, which has the statutory authority to sanction consultant appointments, wanted to do a review before making the posts permanent. When I receive that review, those posts will automatically become permanent and will be advertised as such. That was the largest ever appointment of any one category of consultant in any specialty in any one year; that is the kind of immediate priorities we identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the <Col N="305" /> Eastern Regional Authority and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require continuing care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health boards succeeded in contracting more than 700 beds under the initiative and this has helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospital. Deputy Rabbitte talked about alleviating pressures immediately; we did so and the winter initiative was one such initiative. We did not wait to build them but moved immediately. What would the situation be today if we had not provided funding for those additional 700 beds? It helped to significantly alleviate pressures right across the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the 80 nursing home beds that were not used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That level of funding was repeated over the winter period October 2001 to March 2002 and has been of significant benefit. There is no question about that. Everyone acknowledges that the initiative I took then was of significant benefit to health agencies in responding to the high level of demand for hospital beds over the winter period.</P>
      <P>Each of the health boards and voluntary hospitals recognised the priority attaching to investment in accident and emergency service provision and has responded accordingly. By way of example, I would like to outline for the House the initiatives taken by them to alleviate pressures in accident and emergency departments. These include the provision of additional long-stay beds which have become available in the catchment area served by Beaumont Hospital and a new 50-bed unit in Lusk which was opened by the Northern Area Health Board in November 2001. It will be fully operational shortly and will increase the number of public extended-care beds in the area. Initiatives such as this will allow for earlier discharge of patients, mainly elderly, who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who require a level of care more appropriate to their needs. They will also free up acute hospital beds for acute admissions. We purchased St. Joseph's, Raheny, for £11 million within weeks of being alerted to the possibility by the ERHA.</P>
      <P>A new project between the Northern Area Health Board and Beaumont Hospital was initiated and funded by the ERHA in 2001. Called the Home First project, it is designed to allow elderly patients to return to their homes after hospitalisation with the necessary support services being provided in their homes. I will continue to support this initiative as we evaluate its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other examples include the provision of additional funding to the ERHA and the health boards to support the following: the development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital; the provision of minor injuries units in Beaumont, the Mater, James Connolly Memorial, <Col N="306" /> St. James's and Tallaght hospitals; development of the accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital; extension to the accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital; provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital; the recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel at accident and emergency sites in the Eastern region; development of new accident and emergency departments at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, and The Children's Hospital, Temple Street; planning of a new accident and emergency department for Cork University Hospital; development of the accident and emergency department at Galway University Hospital, Castlebar General Hospital and Tullamore General Hospital; development of a new accident and emergency department at Portlaoise General Hospital; the appointment of a design team for the development of a new accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital; and the upgrading of accident and emergency facilities at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Monaghan General Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. Additional security measures in accident and emergency departments and further initiatives in this area are under review.</P>
    <P>In the health strategy we have also identified additional initiatives which will directly impact on improving accident and emergency service provision. These include the establishment of 24-hour GP co-operatives which will help reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise attend accident and emergency departments. A sum of &euro;17 million is being invested in the development of this service in 2002.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Other initiatives are, such as the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the reorganisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in accident and emergency departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs &ndash; emergency &ndash; in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients are prioritised in terms of admission to hospital through accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional personnel to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at accident and emergency departments; and the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in accident and emergency departments. Such information will provide staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these initiatives are under way and they combine to represent a comprehensive response to the needs of accident and emergency departments. The key to making sure that these initiatives have the desired effect is to ensure that all partner groups work together and that effective strategic plans are in place to guide implementation. The development of accident and emergency services will be further informed by a major review of the structure, operation and staffing of accident and emergency services and departments with a view to improving the provision of patient care. This major review is being undertaken by Comhairle na nOspidéal, the statutory body which, <i>inter alia,</i> regulates the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff. When we announced funding for an additional 25 accident and emergency consult<Col N="308" /> ants, this statutory body wanted to do the major review. That review will inform and take an in-depth look at how we can move forward in terms of the organisation of the accident and emergency service within the overall context of hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no consolation to the people on trolleys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This major review has involved extensive consultation with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, each health board, relevant voluntary hospitals, appropriate professional bodies and other interested parties. The review has also involved an extensive examination of best practice models of accident and emergency services in Britain, Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. I understand that this work is at an advanced stage and I look forward to assessing its findings in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the initiatives which I have outlined above will contribute significantly to the improvement of service provision in accident and emergency departments for all personnel working in these departments and for the patients receiving these services. However, I acknowledge that these improvements, which are needed because of the failure of the Opposition parties to give this matter priority attention while in office, will not be made overnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the new developments are being built as we speak. It takes time to build them, but that is being done. A lot of work has gone into the redesign of a range of hospital sites as I outlined earlier.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on the proposed industrial action to be taken by nursing staff in accident and emergency departments. I had the opportunity to meet representatives of the nurses on 21 February last. In response to Deputy O'Sullivan, I have been to accident and emergency departments across the country. I have met nurses and spoken to them about the pressures under which they work because of historic issues, buildings built in the 1970s, and because more people are attending hospital today than ever before. Some 90,000 more people attended hospital this year than last year.</P>
      <P>We had a constructive meeting on 21 February. It was acknowledged that difficulties can exist in accident and emergency departments from time to time because of the uncertainty surrounding the volume and complexity of cases presenting for care and treatment. I pay tribute to the nursing staff and doctors who work in our accident and emergency departments. Because of the issues I have outlined, they are under a lot of pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the meeting we identified a number of measures to be taken to address the problems. It was indicated that further measures must be <Col N="309" /> taken and there should be a demonstration of earnestness at local level in terms of more interim measures to alleviate immediate pressures. We are responding to that. Following the meeting, I wrote to chief executive officers of voluntary hospitals and of the health boards asking them to engage with the Nursing Alliance in each accident and emergency department with the aim of addressing current difficulties. I am happy to advise the House that there has been positive dialogue between nursing staff and health services management on ways in which improvements can be effected, and these discussions are continuing.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Health Services Employers Agency, HSEA, and the Nursing Alliance met on Thursday, 28 February to discuss the proposed industrial action. I understand that this was a constructive meeting at which a range of proposed initiatives aimed at further alleviating service pressures were discussed in some detail. All parties agreed to meet again tomorrow, 8 March. I remain absolutely committed to doing all I can to help management and staff at a local level move forward in the implementation of major improvements.</P>
    <P>I am also determined that implementation and future policy will be guided by policies informed by all key groups. Partnership is absolutely essential to effective policy development and implementation, in this as much as other areas. That is why I think it is important to convene a national accident and emergency forum in response to a request from the Nursing Alliance. This forum will identify urgent measures which can be taken to enhance accident and emergency services and is consistent with the commitment in the health strategy in this regard. The forum will be chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former President of Dublin City University. Participants will include relevant stakeholders, hospital management, members of the medical and nursing professions, para-medical and non-nursing personnel, staff representative associations and unions, patient advocacy groups and other interested parties.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen will be represented on it as he is a member of the health board. He will be a key player. Workable solutions may be reached, with dialogue and sharing of views, which will assist in alleviating the existing problems in parallel with the implementation on a regional basis of the initiative I described earlier. I am satisfied the range of initiatives I have outlined will contribute to a significant improvement in service to patients attending accident and emergency departments and represent tangible evidence of this Government's commitment to the development of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be much further along this road if we had not been required to make up for the lack of funding and planning which we inherited. I have no doubt we will hear this evening and over the next few months the old refrain from the <Col N="310" /> Opposition that its record has nothing to do with anything.

More patients than ever are receiving the care and treatment they need. They have a right to access services and it is incumbent on us to ensure that these are provided without delay. Patients also have a right to a well co-ordinated hospital service including an accident and emergency service which is capable of responding to their needs and which is integrated with other elements of health care provision.</P>
      <P>This Government will continue to invest in the development of a high-quality, equitable and accessible hospital service. Much has been achieved to date but much still remains to be done and this Government is committed to doing it in a far more structured and comprehensive way than any previous Government.</P>

      <P>Examples include the new accident and emergency departments in Portlaoise and Castlebar, the upgrading of facilities at Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, Monaghan General Hospital and Our Lady's General Hospital in Navan, the further development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's and the Mater, the planning of a new accident and emergency department for Cork University Hospital and more, as has been illustrated by Deputy Martin. All of us know how much has been done. However, we also know that had Deputies Quinn and Noonan, the Ministers for Health and Finance in the rainbow coalition, begun the work of reform two and a half years earlier when they had the money but lacked the political will, we would have more nurses, more wards, more screenings, more treatments and better accident and emergency services in our hospitals.</P>

      <P>There is real anger on this side of the House because Fine Gael and Labour, in the last few months of rainbow government, cut funding on waiting lists reduction by 20% when those same waiting lists had actually risen by 27%. Waiting lists would be far shorter today if Labour and Fine Gael had governed responsibly. There is anger on this side of the House because the massive programme of investment &ndash; the 125% increase in health spending since 1997 &ndash; was not begun earlier. There would be more wards, more clinics, more screenings today if Labour and Fine Gael had governed properly at that time. There is anger on this side of the House because funding for substantial increases in nursing training places was not put in place before 1997. There would be more nurses working in our wards right now had Labour and Fine Gael done something about that. There is anger and frustration about the state of the health services on this side of the House but there is also a drive to reform which is absent from the parties opposite. We are determined to invest, to reform, to provide the poorest of our citizens with the best medical assistance in the minimum time.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="313" />In my area, the health of older people, much has been done in the past five years. We came into office at a time when less than &euro;13 million was being spent on the development of services for older people. That sum has risen to almost &euro;100 million this year. While we are working in partnership with Comhairle na nOspidéal to review the structure, operation and staffing of accident and emergency services and other departments. We have asked chief executive officers of the health boards and voluntary hospitals to engage with the Nursing Alliance in every accident and emergency department in order to address the present undeniable difficulties. The Minister has also announced his intention to establish an accident and emergency forum, made up of all health stake holders working in this area. Since 1997 we have reformed, invested and championed a partnership approach to deal the very real problems which exist in our health services. We have set out a solid policy basis for reform and negotiated with stakeholders. We have picked up the pieces from decades of under investment and a lack of political will to reform and invest on the part of the parties opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to listen to a Minister who has set up 104 different reviews, forums, committees, inquiries and examinations and today tells us that he is setting up yet another forum. I recall the film <i>101 Dalmations</i>, which was not half as spotty as the Minister's approach to running the health services. This Minister will not take decisions, which is what he is paid for and elected to do, and this contributes to the mess the services are in. That is the real reason we are in this mess.</P>
      <P>The Minister made much of the fact that he had set up Comhairle na nOspidéal and announced 25 additional consultants for accident and emergency. However, these were delayed and only 14 or 15 posts were filled on a temporary basis by Comhairle na nOspidéal because it is carrying out another review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>When it is finished its review, it will report to the Minister and the Minister has said that he will assess that review. Is that not what has been happening for the past five years <Col N="314" /> on 104 different committees. I misled this House for a long time because I thought that there were only 74 or 75 of them. However, I found out last week in a parliamentary reply that there are 104. The Minister gets up here and has the brass neck to talk about more forums and another review group. It is absolutely pathetic.</P>
      <P>I have put forward proposals and I notice that the Minister in his contribution did not take on any of the detailed proposals put forward by Fine Gael. It has put forward proposals for separate accident and emergency departments in hospitals, for the fast-tracking of senior citizens along the lines of the pilot scheme in Limerick and for elective beds or perhaps even an elective hospital. That could, for example, be in Cherry Orchard in west Dublin where there is no accident and emergency unit.</P>
      <P>People are clustering the accident and emergency wards because they cannot get into elective beds. That is the problem and I have not seen one pastoral letter, one bishop wringing his hands, one Church of Ireland primate or Catholic bishop, or one Muslim or Jewish leader hitting out at the apartheid in the health services in Ireland. That apartheid was wilfully and deliberately extended on the eve of a by-election last year by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Members know that apartheid has operated and continues to operate in secondary care hospitals. However, last year, on the eve of a by-election, the Minister extended medical cards to those aged 70 and older. I have no difficulty with that. The Minister accuses me of wanting to give the card to 65 year olds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the House what my proposals are in a minute, and they are comprehensive. What did the Minister do? When the average payment to IMO members such as doctors and GPs was in the order of £50, which is probably a reasonable average, he gave them almost £250 to settle, and not to take on those on lower incomes but to take on senior citizens aged 70 and upwards. That was simply because those people vote. There is now a situation where retired bank managers, chief executives of State companies, doctors and Ministers&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;qualify for a medical card at enormous expense while people living on £101 or &euro;128 per week, alone in poverty, misery and in the cold, have been left without a card. Not one bishop has put out a pastoral letter about it. Where have our priorities gone wrong? This is an outrage and is apartheid in every sense of that word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the deep south of the United States, there were two waiting rooms, one for the blacks and one for the whites. That is the way it is here <Col N="315" /> except that the &ldquo;whites&rdquo; are the rich while the poor, be they black or white, are left waiting in the other room. The poor are the people who clutter up the accident and emergency wards, those on £101&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no priority in accident and emergency. It works on rotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or &euro;128 per week, living alone and denied the medical card. The agreement with the IMO is that up to 40% of the population can be covered. When the rainbow Government was in office, 37% of the population was covered but that figure has fallen to 29% because poor people have been left out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;the death rate among the wealthiest classes is about ten or 11 per 1,000. In the medium classes, that figure is about 23 per 1,000 but among the poorest classes the figure is about 31 or 32 per 1,000. In other words, the death rate is three times as high for poor people of that age group. The Minister of State, as a doctor, knows this is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is three times as high and what do we do? We give wealthy people free access to medicines and doctors while leaving out the poor.</P>
      <P>I will tell the House my proposals because the Minister did not address any of the comprehensive policies that I have put forward. I want to double the income limit for medical cards to bring it up to 40%. Even if that limit is at £10,000, it is not a lot to write home about, but it would bring the rate up to the 40% limit agreed with the IMO. A husband and wife with two children could earn £19,600 under the proposals that I have put forward. I have also said that I would give a free GP service to children up to the age of 18, and beyond that to the lowest paid 60% of the population in full-time education, and to those aged 65 and over as part of the same package.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government wilfully left out poor people and wilfully extended this. The poor are the people who end up in bad health and in hospital. They are the ones who have to go to accident and emergency units and who cannot afford private medicine. There is not a word <Col N="316" /> about that from the people gathered outside this House today. It is apartheid and it has made a major contribution to unfairness and injustice. The Minister has a brass neck to publish a so-called health policy with the word &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; contained in it.</P>
      <P>Unless we target resources along the lines I have suggested, we will not come to terms with the issue. We must invest in primary care in a targeted way and then invest in secondary care. Deloitte &amp; Touche, which wrote the Value for Money report on the health services for the Government recently, when questioned by me at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, agreed that it is better to have a targeted approach in primary care along the lines I propose. There must be total reform of the way hospitals are run, with citizen based hospital boards and a hospital management where managers have to apply for their jobs every seven years in the same way that city managers, Secretaries General of Departments and the Garda Commissioner do. If that is not the case, we will not ensure the accountability we need in the system to end the carry-on there at present.</P>
      <P>Of the 104 reviews that I mentioned, many cater for the vested interests running the services. Patients' interests come about fifth in the queue, and that is the problem. It is the reason I want a covenant of rights and responsibilities for patients. That is not just a charter to be stuck up on a wall but a covenant signed by a patient and an identifiable person in the hospital, overseen by an independent health ombudsman and with a surgeon general reporting directly to this House, no matter who is on the Government side of the House. This will ensure that Members of this House, who provide endless money to incompetent Ministers who cannot run an efficient service, will have an independent report on precisely how the money is being spent.</P>

      <P>I will come to a matter relating to the Minister of State's constituency later, but first I tell him that last Sunday a constituent of his rang a Dublin hospital. She arrived in Dublin on Sunday night, brought by her family, and was prepared for an operation yesterday. She was washed, cleaned, made ready and put into a gown. A nurse then told her that she was sorry, but the operation had been called off. The woman's husband had to leave County Mayo yesterday morning to bring her home. That is the health service we have in this country. I believe that the excuse in that case was shortage of staff. The new excuse is that they have no money because of the winter bug.<Col N="317" /></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should let me continue. I will address that in a moment.</P>
      <P>In the Minister of State's area of the Western Health Board &ndash; he has a lot of good friends in it &ndash; 700 jobs were filled in the last number of years but the problem is that they were not medical jobs. There is a crisis in that people cannot get any kind of procedure without going on a waiting list. The latest thing is that one must go on a waiting list to get on a waiting list, yet lo and behold &ndash; I would like the officials to listen to this &ndash; the Western Health Board spent &euro;70,000 on diaries which it sent to friends and doctors. One would think doctors could not afford them despite all the money they are taking out of the GP scheme. I would not mind if the health board sent five-year diaries to the people waiting for five years for hip, heart and cataract operations and other procedures. It spent &euro;70,000 on diaries even though people are left on trolleys and people in emergency rooms are sent home every day of the week because they cannot be dealt with as we have no money.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department should bring in the chief executive and the people responsible for this. I have written to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and have asked the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate the matter. There is no way that can be justified when there is a crisis in the health service. Somebody can write to me to try to justify it but I will not put up with it and I do not care on whose corns I stand. I do not care what they say about me in the health board because I know they hate me. I know they hate me in the Department of Health and Children but I will represent the people who elect me and will put it on the record every day that people are being treated like second class citizens. There are people who are weak, upset and cannot fight for themselves. When they ring hospitals, they are told to come in and when they do, they are sent home. That is an outrageous scandal.</P>
      <P>The Minister is the man for photographs. Huge money has been spent on public relations. I tabled a parliamentary question and found that, I think, £17 million was spent by that Department on advertisements in the last number of years. The Government has spent £300 million on public relations over the past couple of years.</P>

      <P>It has 85 spin doctors. I would not mind if it spent money on medical doctors but it spends it on spin doctors who were previously employed in RTE, Independent Newspapers. It is no wonder they cannot see anything wrong with this Government because the spin is being spun by its friends. The sick, weak and old who are <Col N="318" /> awaiting hip and cataract operations are waiting for this Government in the long grass.</P>
      <P>Last week a constituent of mine and of the Minister of State applied for the carer's allowance to look after a very sick person. The matter went to the social welfare appeals board. A doctor was sent out although I do not know what sort of doctor he was. He must have been one of the consultants but he was not a medical doctor. Last Monday morning the woman received a letter saying this man was not sick enough for her to get the carer's allowance. The morning she got that letter, she also got a telephone call from the hospital to say the man had died. How sick does the Government want a person to be to consider him or her sick? The carer's allowance meant a lot to that person. She was insulted by the Government, the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs and by the caring profession who said this man did not need full-time care. That man does not need full-time care now because he is gone elsewhere. It is a disgrace, shameful and outrageous that people must wait for treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the five minutes I have to speak, it is very difficult to address a very complex issue such as this but I would like to give two examples of the current situation. On 28 December last in the Minister's constituency, a 74 year old woman was removed from a nursing home to a city hospital. She had a problem and remained on a trolley for six hours. She was then transferred to Waterford, had surgery and died. Her immediate family received a telephone call to say she had passed away and was assured she died a happy death. I wrote to the chief executive of the hospital and the reply I received stated that the woman was moved 80 miles to Waterford because there was no surgeon in Cork city, the second city of this country, to carry out necessary life saving surgery on that woman. That is an example of what has happening in our disjointed health service.</P>
      <P>I know a 62 year old man who cannot climb the stairs at home and who cannot get on a waiting list to get on a waiting list. He has been told by Cork University Hospital that his situation is not sufficiently serious for him to be put on a list for an out-patient appointment. Some 5,000 young children in the Cork-Kerry region are awaiting orthodontic treatment. We were not told until we looked for it that a further 5,000 children are on a waiting list to get an assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Wiley of the ESRI issued a report some months ago on the private public mix. She said that in the interests of equity, there should be a cap of 20% on the level of private practice in our public hospitals. As a member of the Southern Health Board, I attempted to get an idea of the work mix of each of the consultants in the public hospitals in the Cork-Kerry region. I was denied the information which was effectively blocked by consultants in the Southern Health Board area who were afraid the truth would get <Col N="319" /> out in relation to the level of private practice in the public hospitals. The Minister also refused to release that information. I was told it would be a breach of the common contract.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mitchell said, there is apartheid in our public hospitals. The rich get quick access and quick treatment but if one is depending on one's medical card or on the public health services, one will wait. Many people have waited until the day of their death to get treatment. The greatest failure of the Government is that it has provided tax breaks for the rich and the wealthy while it has kept the sick and the elderly waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>I see little sign of the recommendations of the Murphy report on the delivery of acute hospital services which was carried out in Cork being implemented. As Deputy Mitchell said, medical cards are being distributed to the over 70s while some people on social welfare are being denied medical cards because they are &euro;3 over the limit.</P>

The most awkward issue in the delivery of hospital services is the abuse in our public hospitals, which are funded by the taxpayer, where more than 20% of the recommended cap is being seriously exceeded by some consultants, yet the Minister is refusing to take action and even to provide the information to public representatives and to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I wish to share one minute of my time with Deputy Deenihan. My constituency, Clare, has been visited a number of times by the current Minister for Health and Children and his Ministers of State. They have seen that accident and emergency services in the county hospital in Ennis are housed in a very cramped area and that they deserve a larger space in which to work. I recall the Leas-Cheann Comhairle visiting Ennis when he was Minister for Health and Children and he set up a review of accident and emergency services in the general hospital. He was followed <Col N="320" /> by Deputy Woods, who was followed by Deputy Cowen in turn, and both of them contrived to set up a review of accident and emergency services at Ennis. The current Minister promised that Ennis accident and emergency services will be faithfully considered under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Two Ministers have spoken on this motion and despite the promises they made when they visited it, neither of them referred to Ennis general hospital. We heard the harangue of Deputy Killeen who said it was Deputy Noonan who, as Minister for Health and Children, took the money from Ennis and gave it to Limerick. What nonsense.</P>

      <P>&mdash;following the mess made by Fianna Fáil Ministers. I have been there and seen it all. Do the people of Clare not need a proper accident and emergency unit? Are they not entitled to that? Is there no dignity or integrity attached to Ennis general hospital? Do the people in the Department not see the necessity to protect the integrity and dignity of the people of Clare? Why is independent Fianna Fáil running a candidate who is fighting for the hospital and accident and emergency services? Is he foolish? Not at all. This is something that the people of Clare deserve. They have pride in themselves and they want these facilities.</P>
      <P>I could continue this in another public forum and I intend to follow it up. I am very disappointed that the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who is a Minister from the west, did not even mention Ennis hospital in his speech.</P>

      <P>More than 30,000 patients are seen annually in the accident and emergency department of Tralee general hospital. As we speak, there are ten sick people lying on trolleys in the corridor of the hospital adjacent to the accident and emergency unit. There are four cubicles in the unit and they can accommodate only four people. These people have to be examined by junior medical staff as there is no senior consultant in the unit in Tralee. There are senior consultants in Castlebar and Sligo, three in Cork but none in Tralee because it has been totally neglected by the Southern Health Board and its preponderance of representatives from Cork. Patients are totally degraded. There are only six nurses on duty by day and three by night. They are over worked, stressed and being pushed to their limits.</P>

    <P>Patients are referred to the hospital by their GPs and put through the accident and emergency <Col N="321" /> department. They expect a bed but are put on trolleys. Some of these patients will go home rather than lie on a trolley. People will die as a result. It is up to the Government to do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This country had no money in the 1980s and there were excuses and valid reasons for not being able to provide the necessary services, particularly health services. That could not be said about the 1990s. After all, the Government has gone on the public record on many occasions eulogising about how well it has run the country. It said we were among the 20 richest countries in the world. One of the key services Government is required to provide, the health service, has been run down due to inadequate funding. The obvious conclusion is that whatever about the availability of money to Government, when the Government set out its priorities it did not think it worthwhile to devote sufficient resources to the health services.</P>

I do not know how it will go to people's doors and make excuses about why the country is facing a deficit after four years of so-called good Government and unlimited resources.

      <P>I feel sorry for the Minister of State because I know he is a caring and compassionate man. It must be a huge embarrassment for him to have to make excuses in this House for the lack of services in those areas. It must be a source of huge embarrassment to the Government in general to have to say that despite all the riches, wealth and resources that we have <Col N="322" /> enjoyed, it has not been able to provide a health service.</P>
      <P>There are 30,000 people on waiting lists for orthodontic services. Parents bring their children to private orthodontists because there is no service. No service has been provided nor will one be. Things are so bad that we in the Opposition are embarrassed making excuses on the Government's behalf. That is all we can do. We are counselling the people who are unable to gain access to services to which they have a statutory right because Government has not been able to focus on the issues in front of it.</P>
      <P>When resources are pinched or misdirected, those who pay are always the most vulnerable in society. I would have thought that somebody in the Department of Health of Children would have said he or she knew how to deliver the services. It should be possible to deliver them quickly, economically and efficiently. Obviously it is not. A former Taoiseach once said during a general election campaign that he had not realised things were as bad as they were in the health services.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time. I wish to put this Labour motion in context. A year ago the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn admitted that he was warned about impending nursing and medical manpower shortages in our health services. He admitted that he was warned:</P>
      <P>especially with regard to the number of people coming into the nursing profession and the availability of well motivated and qualified people in Ireland. I confess I did not listen to those voices at the time as well as I might have, and the problems the Minister for Health and Children now has are, in part, related to that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of that stark admission, it is bizarre for the Labour Members to table a motion with straight faces calling for, among other things, the provision of additional staff for accident and emergency wards. Given the Labour Party's funding of the health services from 1995 to early 1997, when it told us there were sufficient funds to begin the work of health reforms, it is <Col N="323" /> bizarre that it expects us to take seriously this motion.</P>
      <P>Does the Labour Party believe that by tabling Private Members' motions on health and appearing angry, as Deputy O'Rourke described it, it will erase its shameful neglect of the health service? Listening to the words of the Opposition, with our long memories, we recall the then Minister, Deputy Desmond, starting cuts in mid-1985, and the party is still at it. Does it think this motion will induce amnesia in the electorate or make it believe that Labour is the solution instead of the problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, it does not. There are no illusions on this side of the House as to the capacity problems in our accident and emergency departments. Fianna Fáil in government has put a range of measures in place. We introduced the winter initiative, which included a &euro;45.6 million investment package to alleviate the pressures, and that worked. We provided &euro;65 million investment for 2002 to commission more than 700 new beds in the public acute hospitals, most of which were closed down by the Opposition parties when they were in Government. More than &euro;17 million is being invested this year in establishing On Call Doc, the 24 hour GP service, which will alleviate the demands on accident and emergency services. It is important that these are noted when individual cases are cited.</P>
      <P>Additional measures in the health strategy include the appointment of additional accident and emergency consultants, to which Deputy Deenihan referred. We appointed 12 new consultants in this area last year and funding for an additional 17 was provided. We plan to establish minor injury units to treat patients with non-urgent illnesses who at present opt for accident and emergency service. These are critical and are a feature in other countries. Advance nurse practitioners are being appointed in acute hospitals. Anyone familiar with the health strategy will be aware that I am merely scratching the surface in mentioning these few, but they are part of a costed, implementable partnership health strategy devised by the Government, health professionals, patients and the public, which all participated in the largest public consultation ever conducted in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I contrast this to the Labour Party's alternative, the insurance company health system, which would increase bureaucracy and shut down small, local hospitals. We kept these open in 1985 and 1986 by battling locally. The Fine Gael alternative is to have no health policy but vague meandering between acceptance and rejection of the Labour Party proposal. If these <Col N="324" /> two parties are so concerned with the state of accident and emergency services, why did they make no detailed and specific submission on it to the health strategy when it was being formed, with the nurses, doctors, patients and all health professionals?</P>

      <P>The reason was that they have no workable ideas. In Fine Gael's case, there was no policy to submit. Deputy Shatter stated in the Dáil that the insurance company health service was overly bureaucratic, but that it was questionable if the necessary reform could be brought about by the introduction of a universal health system. He said that less, not more, bureaucracy was needed. So much for a coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>These services need proper funding, policies and partnership between all the stakeholders. The Labour Party's approach is to shout crisis, advance a policy of shutting local hospitals &ndash; I was chairman of a health board when the then Deputy Desmond tried to close our hospital &ndash; and hope that no one remembers how incompetent the party was on health in various Governments. It is not up to the job.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael approach is to shout crisis, hope that no one remembers that it has no policy and in government it too was incompetent on this issue. It is not up to the job either. The workable alternative is Fianna Fáil in government working with the health professionals to reform and invest in a health strategy which is costed and delivered.</P>
      <P>Members make their own points in this debate and most are parochial. It was interesting to hear Deputy Donal Carey boasting of what Deputy Noonan did for Clare, because I now know where the money, that Cork was left short of at that time, went.

      <P>The Labour Party's motion before the House is disappointingly unproductive, which is not unusual as the Labour Party is generally barren in terms of policy and reforming ideas for the health service. The familiar term &ldquo;a lost opportunity&rdquo; springs to mind. This is the party whose health record in government will lose them votes in the forthcoming general election as it did in 1997. It expects the electorate to ignore that record and the fact that its present health policy would close our local hospitals.</P>
      <P>Declan Bree, on Mid-West Radio, confirmed that Labour in government would abandon our national health strategy, with the long-term planning and the years that went into it, in favour of cheap auction politics by giving medical cards to all irrespective of any criteria.</P>

      <P>That sounds rather sad as I would prefer a well worked out health strategy that deals with all the people's health needs. How will Labour candidates explain on the doorsteps that they increased the health spend by a meagre &euro;400 million in their term in office, when the Fianna Fáil led Government spent an additional &euro;5 billion, £4 billion, since 1997? How will they keep a straight face when they compare those figures? They can link them to inflation and growth or whatever they like, but the Labour Party, compared to Fianna Fáil in government, raised the health spend by a paltry sum.</P>
      <P>Facts and statistics may be dull but they remain facts. How will the Labour Party explain that it allowed waiting lists to rise by 27% when it was in office last? Under this Government the lists have been reduced by 25% since 1997. How will the Labour Party explain that in 1997 it cut the funding to deal with waiting lists by 20%? How could anyone cut funding at such a time? The Ministers as well as backbenchers could ask that question, and we look forward to the reply, which I am sure will be given in summing up the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan will get his opportunity. He should not interrupt me. Those of us on this side of the House have brains too.</P>
      <P>It was left to this Government to set about restructuring, reforming and investing in the health services. No one in Fianna Fáil is asserting that all is well or that a 25% cut in the waiting lists is sufficient. We all hold clinics and we know the facts, but we have made definite progress over the past five years and we will build on that solid record over the next five.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a health board and I am aware that 4,000 additional doctors and nurses have been appointed nationally; 80,000 additional treatments were carried out last year over the 1997 figure; 3,500 extra residential and respite care places have been made available for those with a disability; and free medical cards were given to those over the age of 70.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil can point to a solid record of achievement and it has a solid policy basis for further reform through the national health strategy. We can say that a vote for Fianna Fáil will deliver on waiting lists of no longer than 12 months by the end of the year, no longer than six months by the end of 2003 and no longer than three months by the end of 2004. We can also point to 3,000 additional hospital beds over the coming years. More than 700 of those additional beds are already on-stream, many of which are in the north west, but we anticipate many more, with a further 200 contracted from private hospitals. Those new beds will enable us to carry out 30,000 additional treatments this year alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil had a solid record on health reform in the past five years and it has solid, costed, implementable and agreed policies for the next five years and beyond. In my constituency, votes <Col N="327" /> to establish a Fianna Fáil-led Government resulted in new accident and emergency consultant posts. One consultant took up duty in June 2001 and the report by the health board states: &ldquo;A considerable improvement in the service has already been realised on many fronts, including speed of response and quality of service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Specific to Letterkenny General Hospital, a new medical rehabilitation unit has been built and funding for the hospital has vastly improved on 1997. On the issue of breast care, there has been co-operation with the Altnagelvin Hospital. The list of achievements includes day surgery rates of 52%; 14 new consultant posts in 2001 in the North-Western Health Board; a 60% increase in ICU beds in Letterkenny General Hospital; a 17% increase in renal dialysis services; a 15% increase in respite care admissions; and a 91% reduction in adult ophthalmic waiting lists over six months and a 65% reduction for children waiting over three months. The list of achievements in the North-Western Health Board area under this Fianna Fáil-led Administration is lengthy. A vote for Fianna Fáil is a vote to complete the job of health service reform in Donegal and throughout the State over the next five years and beyond.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dennehy said earlier, the Opposition parties can shout &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; at every turn and run away from their own record of Government failure and from their own policies to close local hospitals. They can play auction politics, but I would prefer to have a national health strategy that is well thought out, costed and ready for implementation. The current Ministers and Ministers of State are best placed to take the helm for the next five years of what will be a ten year strategy. I am confident that a Fianna Fáil-led Administration will be in power for the next ten years and will address the issue of the neglect of the health services when Labour was in power. We must not go back to the days of Labour in Government when we had to close hospitals.</P>

      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the doctors, nurses and all the staff of our hospitals for their dedication and commitment to the patients in their care. I thank the Labour Party for affording us the opportunity to discuss the health services. We welcome all such opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most salient point emerging from the debate is that while the parties opposite slam all Government proposals and the efforts of Government, in partnership with the health professionals, to reform the health services and improve the A&amp;E service, they lack the workable policies and solutions for the current undeniable problems in the health services. It is not good <Col N="328" /> enough for the parties opposite to simply slam all proposals and solutions. They are like criers at a wake, with an ochón for every reforming measure of this Government. The Opposition parties failed to increase the health spend, provide for medical manpower shortages and inject much needed funding into capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The search for solutions to the complex problems experienced in accident and emergency departments appears to be confined to this side of the House. I am proud of the fact that the Government has more than doubled investment in the health service. Deputy Durkan said we would be called to explain where the money has gone, but I want to highlight a number of areas in which funding was increased.</P>
    <P>The winter initiative announced in 2000 provided more than &euro;40 million to reduce pressure on accident and emergency units. It provided for the recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants, anaesthetists and the contracting of more than 700 beds by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards for patients no longer in need of acute care, thus freeing up the much needed acute beds for those awaiting admission to hospitals through the accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>Where was the money spent? A &euro;65 million investment package to commission more than 700 new beds in the public acute system, 300 of which have been allocated to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, will also reduce demand for accident and emergency services, as will the On Call Doc 24 hour GP service.</P>
    <P>For all its rhetoric and public anxiety on the issue, the Labour Party lacks the policies to effect improvement in the health system and the accident and emergency service in particular. Labour Party policy documents are largely silent on the issue of A&amp;E. The measures called for in the motion, which we are happy to support, include more staff, resources and community beds. Those are Government health strategy proposals. Not only does the Labour Party not have any proposals, it is now starting to rob ours.</P>

      <P>Does the Labour Party not want more staff, resources and community beds? There appears to be perplexity and disorder in Fine Gael on the issue of health, as well as a lack of interest. Last October, the Fine Gael spokesperson on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Flanagan, publicly urged FÁS to end its overseas recruitment programme which brought much needed nurses, doctors and health professionals into the Irish health system. Only a week before that, the Fine Gael spokesperson on health asserted that the recruitment of highly qualified nurses from overseas is the only thing preventing meltdown in our hospitals. Deputy Flanagan does not want foreign nurses but the <Col N="329" /> health spokesperson says we will have meltdown if we do not get them.</P>
      <P>This perplexity and disorder on the issue permeates the entire Fine Gael Party. The Fine Gael spokesperson on health asserted in this House that the universal health insurance model was overly bureaucratic and that what was needed was less, and not more, bureaucracy. Deputy Noonan agreed with him. He stated in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that it would lead to accident and emergency chaos. My constituency colleague and the Fine Gael spokesperson on health, Deputy Gay Mitchell, said he was committed to steadfastly backing the universal health insurance system, a policy proposed and promoted by the Labour Party spokesperson on health&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will share a secret with Deputy Ryan. Before this was proposed by the spokesperson for Deputy Ryan's party, I was in the happy position to be in her company when she was in the company of the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, who had some interest in the scheme. The Deputy asked the First Lady for her views on it and she said &ndash; I am paraphrasing &ndash; not to go next, nigh or&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I have only a short time remaining, I will not say what I was going to say, as it would not be palatable to the Opposition. I will finish on a positive note. We were asked where the money was being spent. I will refer specifically to my constituency where St. James's Hospital is benefiting from the Government's commitment to accident and emergency services. Some 75 new acute hospital beds are being put in place this year, a &euro;71 million A&amp;E unit is being developed this year and we also have the appointment of an additional A&amp;E consultant. That is the type of serious approach the Opposition should mimic in its future policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the health services is taking place against the background of an expenditure of &euro;8 billion this year, which is 2.25 times the 1997 budget. The point is made frequently, particularly by Opposition speakers, that <Col N="330" /> the improvement is not commensurate with the additional spend on the health services. Ultimately, that needs to be refuted because there has been an enormous improvement in the quality and range of services, which were not in place heretofore. There are almost 20,000 extra employees in the health service and some of them are delivering services in areas other than accident and emergency, one of the areas being debated in this motion. The improvement and extra expenditure is taking place in the face of several decades of woeful neglect of the health services. This will result in a period within which the extra expenditure will not result in the kind of response to the problem that people want.</P>
      <P>I am greatly concerned that debating this issue at this time is likely to exacerbate industrial relations position and will probably lead to making a resolution more difficult. This is an area where Members cannot afford to act irresponsibly. There are serious issues at stake which need to be resolved through the normal industrial relations machinery. In that regard, I welcome that the Minister has set up the A&amp;E forum to take account of the difficulties and propose resolutions.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers &ndash; at least one tonight and many others elsewhere &ndash; and commentators tend to attack administrative and medical health board employees and seek to scapegoat them. On occasion politicians seek to use them to hide their own inadequacies. We need to remember that important work is done by people who send out notification of appointments, administer the medical card scheme, deal with housing aid for the elderly, catering, maintenance, ambulance personnel and so on. They deserve better than to be denigrated and belittled for cheap political capital.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to Ennis General Hospital in my constituency. The Minister made a day long visit on Friday last, which was unprecedented. He performed a number of positive functions, which is always nice. He opened an acute psychiatric unit, which is a major improvement from the position that pertained for several decades for people in need of medical intervention in that area. It is a wonderful unit which is staffed by, among others, a former colleague of my Labour colleagues, who is delighted to be moving from a Dickensian building to this wonderful new facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides the improvement in provision for the patients there, the new unit improves the general appearance of the hospital. In some respects, it points up the differences between the 1940s facilities and those which are appropriate to a new century. It also gives people confidence that in the health service there are people who realise we need to move forward in an unfashionable area, namely that of mental health, which we are doing successfully. I commend the Minister, his predecessor, health board officials and Members for their input into moving forward in an area, which traditionally was hidden from public view. The appalling conditions, which in many cases were <Col N="331" /> the norm in such institutions, got very little public attention or emphasis.</P>
    <P>The Minister also opened a cardiac rehabilitation unit, which in a sense reflects the lifestyle changes in modern society, where virtually any of us might be likely to be in need of cardiac rehabilitation rather than a range of other facilities. He also opened a mammography unit. The general point I am making is that many substantial improvements are happening in hospitals throughout the country. The most significant in the case of Ennis is that the Minister agreed last month to approve the appointment of a design team for a major refurbishment of the hospital.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in Ennis General Hospital in most urgent need of such refurbishment is the accident and emergency unit. It is probably true that A&amp;E units in all the older hospitals throughout the country are located in areas that are too small and unsuitable and which make it difficult to develop them to cope with the types of pressures they have come under during the past five to ten years. The fact that the Minister announced the appointment of the design team puts an end to uncertainty concerning Ennis hospital going back three decades, since the Fitzgerald report. That uncertainty and concern is only now being addressed. This is something anyone with an interest in health services in Clare welcomes with open arms.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the development of the hospital in two phases. One of the areas that will be developed in the first phase is the refurbishment and new layout of the accident and emergency unit. People there worked in difficult conditions. Throughout the county there are people who have reason to be extremely grateful to the staff who worked there and for the level of facilities and expertise that was available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the winter initiative in 2000 in which he invested in excess of &euro;40 million and provided a substantial role for additional A&amp;E consultants. That is important in terms of the quality of service that can be developed in A&amp;E.</P>
    <P>Perhaps even more important is the need to develop primary care. The Minister has done more in a very short time than anybody else to recognise the role of primary care and to set up the on-call 24 hour GP service. In County Clare the GPs came together with their colleagues in north Tipperary, who are ready to roll with this service, and their colleagues in Limerick, and made their proposals to which the Minister responded positively. That service will be up and running by the middle of the year. There is no doubt that far too many people are presenting initially at A&amp;E units who should more properly be presenting to the primary care service, which includes GPs and a range of other health personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Labour Party motion which deplores the conditions within the accident and emergency services in the general hospitals throughout the country. It saddens me, however, that once again we are required to do so. This in itself is an indictment of the performance of the Government, which has allowed this appalling situation to deteriorate since coming into office nearly five years ago.</P>
      <P>During this period I visited the accident and emergency units in Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital, which cater for the catchment areas of my constituents in Dublin North, on numerous occasions. Some of these visits came about as a result of telephone calls from constituents appealing for assistance for their parents and children while others were on my own initiative.</P>
      <P>On a recent visit to Beaumont Hospital the scene resembled one from &ldquo;ER&rdquo;. The department appears to be full of nurses and doctors running from one patient to another. The centre, the side aisles and cubicles were filled with trolleys occupied by patients. On that particular night, I counted over 30 patients on trolleys in the corridors awaiting a bed in a ward. On my way out, I came across two people consoling an elderly man on a trolley. One of them recognised me, beckoned me over, and said, angrily, &ldquo;My father here has worked hard all his life to educate his family on a modest income. He has paid all his taxes and PRSI contributions. On the first occasion he requires the assistance of the State, he has had to wait 24 hours on a trolley for a ward bed. What sort of a society is this?&rdquo;  He was right. The current position is scandalous. The Government has failed miserably to deal with those who require this service.</P>
      <P>I recall a telephone call from a constituent who waited over eight hours with her mother in the accident and emergency unit in Beaumont Hospital. Apart from the overcrowding, she said there was only one small toilet available for use by patients and their families. Her mother was embarrassed and unwilling to queue for toilet facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is it that Ireland, one of the richest countries in the world, provides one of the lowest levels of health care in terms of hospital beds and doctors <i>per capita </i>and percentage of GDP? Has it anything to do with the fact that the service in general caters for the poor, the sick and the aged who do not have the financial resources to gain immediate access to private health care facilities? The vast majority of those who have gone though the accident and emergency units, either as patients or as a patient's relative or friend have the highest regard for the doctors, nurses, administrators and general operative staff working in such traumatic and stressful conditions. Could one blame such professionals if they were to give <Col N="333" /> serious consideration to moving from the public health service to less stressful and more rewarding employment in the private sector? We must not allow this to happen. A properly funded national health service must be provided.</P>
    <P>As this may be my last opportunity to raise health issues in this Dáil, I wish to raise with the Minister the scandalous attitude adopted by him in respect of those with an intellectual disability resident in psychiatric hospitals throughout the length and breadth of the country, including St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane. In 1998, St. Ita's complex was promised, but as a result of many delays the planning application stage has not been reached. This is scandalous. People are waiting for TDs and other candidates to arrive at their doors where they will get a clear message about this matter. The Government has forgotten those it should care for, namely, the ordinary people who cannot finance themselves in private care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. An eminent accident and emergency consultant at St. James's Hospital, Dr. Patrick Plunkett, said:</P>
      <P>Why does a country with one of the strongest economies in Europe have one of the weakest provisions of health care in terms of hospital beds<i> per capita</i>, doctors <i>per capita</i> and percentage of GDP spent on health care provision? I have to assume that this is because there is no profit to be made from health care, in a system such as ours.</P>
      <P>Emergency departments the length and breadth of this land are full of patients deemed by their doctors to be in need of immediate hospital care. These cause overcrowding, which is stressful for the patients, for their relatives and for the health care workers trying to care for them. Like an over-full bus, where a newcomer cannot access the single empty seat at the back, or a plane in a holding pattern above a busy airport, the emergency departments are unable to take more patients into cubicles for evaluation and care. They must wait, stacked in the waiting room, until a space becomes available. It does not matter whether there is one doctor or six doctors available to see patients. Until space is freed up, no more patients can be seen.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in playing politics with health because health provision is a necessity. If I had the choice of reducing capital gains tax from 40% to 20% for the well off I would rather see some tax revenue, my own included, being spent on health care. One gets only one chance at health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in accident and emergency departments has deteriorated to the point of a real crisis. That is not a political charge; it is a fact. A survey taken some weeks ago disclosed that there were over 100 patients lying on trolleys in accident and emergency departments throughout the country. Hard pressed nursing staff have now reached the end of their tether and have <Col N="334" /> been forced, reluctantly, to take limited industrial action over the conditions that pertain at their places of work. They are doing so in order to compel the Government and the Minister to improve the conditions for staff and patients alike. That 90% of the members of both SIPTU and the INO voted for industrial action is an indication of their frustration.</P>
    <P>There is no point in engaging in the fig-leaf of setting up forums. We are worn out from forums, strategy groups and focus groups on which we could write theses. Action is what is required. The people are sick of death bed conversions by the Minister in an attempt to deflect nurses from taking action. One of the banes of nurses working in accident and emergency departments is the division of responsibility, taking notes, attending to administrative and clerical duties. That division of responsibility, which was recommended by the commission and is still to be implemented would help. There has been an abject failure of hospital management to fully comprehend and deal with the overcrowding and workload problems of recent years.</P>
    <P>At a time of unprecedented wealth, how have we arrived at a situation where ambulances can be turned away because of chronic overcrowding in casualty wards? Do we want a society that consigns patients to trolleys in cramped conditions where, as Deputy Ryan said, doctor-patient confidentiality can be compromised?</P>
    <P>It is imperative that a proper admission and discharge policy is put in place at individual hospital level. It involves additional personnel charged with that responsibility at executive level in the hospital who would be able to make instant decisions without having to go up the line for guidance. Personnel should be in charge to make the decision on whether a person can be dealt with as an emergency patient. The INO has made a proposal which would considerably improve liaison measures, ensure that all the stakeholders would be fully informed and help minimise problems by focusing on stronger management and improved team work. All of this would complement the provision, where necessary, of additional bed capacity.</P>
    <P>In Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, the completion of Phase 2B would help substantially alleviate the situation. Nothing has been done since 1997. The Government can crow all it wishes. It is a scandal that doctors, nurses and attendants working in a hospital can look through a window and see a huge empty building. All stages should be completed to ensure the provision of high quality patient care. That is what has to be achieved but, to date, it has been shamefully neglected.</P>
    <P>There are about 30,000 admissions per year or 2,500 per month at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, approximately 20% of which are people who are called back for review. The overall admissions figure is increasing each year. Large hospitals such as Mullingar Hospital will have to have accident and emergency consultants <Col N="335" /> appointed, and they should not be bypassed for such appointments as has happened in the past. Two such consultants are needed at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital to ensure 24 hour consultant accident and emergency cover is provided. Innovative solutions to the problem must also be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The accident and emergency department of St. James's Hospital, which is in my constituency of Dublin South-Central, was designed to cater for 30,000 patients per annum, but has to process up to 55,000 people each year instead. Is it any wonder, therefore, that there are constant reports of chaos, including long waiting times of up to 48 hours? People have to lie on trolleys in corridors and they sometimes express real anger and frustration as a result. I emphasise that my criticisms are accompanied by praise for the hard-working, courteous and frequently exhausted or stressed staff in the hospital.</P>
      <P>A recent newspaper report highlighted that patients from Dublin travel outside their health board areas for treatment, to bypass the long waiting times in accident and emergency departments in some of Dublin's larger hospitals, including St. James's. According to a consultant, there are problems in accident and emergency wards because there is nowhere to put patients who can be discharged following their recovery from an acute episode, but who need somewhere to convalesce. The entire health care system is in a state of chaos and is near collapse. If people move from their health board areas to look for attention, there are consequential effects throughout the system.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority, which funds the major Dublin hospitals, responded to the recent consultants' value for money report by saying it is working to address the difficulties. It announced plans in February 2001 to address various initiatives to improve access and reduce waiting lists in casualty departments. Such plans are entirely unimportant for patients, however, as their problems have not been eased. Waiting lists are longer, accident and emergency departments are more chaotic and a large number of social welfare recipients are terrified of losing their medical card entitlements.</P>
      <P>The view was expressed in the value for money report that there has been little change in the overall management structure of the health system. It appears that some health boards have become overgrown, like a camel with too many humps. Administration and management seem to form a large part of the camel. Doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and other health care professionals form the substitute team and not the premier league team, as should be the case. We need to examine the size, structure and composition of health boards, as problems in these areas are perceived as having the potential to limit value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" />Throughout the debate today, the Minister for Health and Children and his Fianna Fáil colleagues have stated that the Labour Party does not have positive suggestions on how matters may be improved. I suggest that a review of health board structures, members and governance would go some way to creating a better outlook for the health services, including accident and emergency departments. It is a great pity that patients continue to suffer while we wait for serious action to improve the health system.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed when I hear Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats saying investment in the health service is twice that provided under the last Administration. The coalition partners make great noise about this but it should not be a surprise, given the unprecedented level of resources at the Government's disposal. It is right that health spending should have increased in the past few years, as the economy has been able to support it. The problem is, however, that money has not been spent properly, equally or fairly. The Government assumed that problems could be solved by pumping millions into the health service, but it is now clear that the money has made little or no impact due to the absence of structural or strategic plans to spend it. Expenditure without value for money audits or analysis of where and how it can be spent is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, has said the Government is working to review structures and that it intends to establish an accident and emergency forum. These aspirations sound very good but they are no replacement for action. I do not know what planet Fianna Fáil is living on or why it has insisted on a trip down memory lane this afternoon. It needs to recognise that this is 2002 and to acknowledge that, five years after it came to power, many people are still waiting for action on the health care system. Others have died, unfortunately, and are no longer on waiting lists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion proposed on behalf of the Labour Party by Deputy McManus and the comments made by my colleagues in connection with accident and emergency services throughout the country. I wish to focus on two hospitals in my constituency, St. Michael's in Dún Laoghaire and St. Columcille's in Loughlinstown. I wish to pay tribute to the staff of both hospitals and to convey the appreciation of many of my constituents for the care and attention they have received from the medical, nursing and support units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious problem in relation to accident and emergency care came to my attention late last year when I discovered that an instruction had been issued by the East Coast Area Health Board to ambulance staff in relation to St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. The chief executive of the health board said in a letter that there would be changes in accident and emergency services at the hospital as part of an agreement between the three hospitals in the health board <Col N="337" /> area which provide accident and emergency services. The effect of these changes from the start of the year was that St. Michael's stopped taking patients between 8 a.m. on Sundays and 8 a.m. on Mondays and each night between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. In other words, ambulance crews were instructed not to take patients to the hospital during the night or at weekends.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I made a public issue of the matter in my constituency. I made representations to the East Coast Area Health Board. The detailed reply I received from the chief executive of the health board stated that changes are being made to provide a new type of accident and emergency service in St. Michael's, St. Columcille's and St. Vincent's. The letter said that additional consultants were being appointed on a temporary basis and that various changes were being made, which I welcome. It is intended, however, according to the chief executive, to introduce clear protocols and procedures to reflect and underpin current practice on the referral of emergency cases. The reply I received stated that it is intended to ensure St. Michael's Hospital is resourced to meet the role it plays in providing treatment for walk-in, self-referral and GP referral cases after 8 p.m. each night. In other words, ambulance cases will not be brought to the hospital.</P>
    <P>I object strongly to the removal of the accident and emergency ambulance service from St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, which is a major commercial centre and capital of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown administrative area. It has been decided that ambulances will no longer take accident and emergency cases there which, by any standards, represents a downgrading of the hospital. I want the Minister for Health and Children to acknowledge my strong objection to this measure and to take some steps to deal with it. It is not acceptable that people who have accidents in Dún Laoghaire and surrounding areas have to go by ambulance to St. Vincent's Hospital, rather then the one nearby.</P>
    <P>I have said in the House on previous occasions that there is no major hospital between St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown and Wexford town. I do not know of another part of the country without a major hospital as large as the area between north Wexford, through County Wicklow and into south Dublin. Those with serious complaints in County Wicklow and south County Dublin have to go through heavy traffic to reach a city centre hospital in Dublin. I appeal once more to the Minister for Health and Children to take the necessary steps to ensure a new regional hospital is built at Loughlinstown to serve the needs of my constituency and my neighbouring constituency, which is represented by Deputy McManus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this important motion. As a member of the South West Area Health Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority I have received many complaints regarding problems in accident and <Col N="338" /> emergency departments in Kildare and Dublin. I visit hospitals regularly and am aware of the problems faced by hospital bed managers due to the lack of respite or nursing care facilities for unfortunate patients recovering from operations and so on. Such people do not have family or others who would enable them to go home. These unfortunate patients have to stay in general hospitals where they occupy much needed beds.</P>
      <P>Despite numerous representations we have not advanced this situation one iota. We are not addressing this issue or trying to understand the basic problem in this regard. Many senior citizens recovering from operations or serious illnesses are in hospital and do not have anywhere to go. These people occupy hospital beds when there may be a nursing home in their area where a neighbour or friend could visit them and assist them to return to a normal life. We are not addressing the lack of a second stage of care in the health system to which such patients could be moved. There is a problem with the lack of respite care and nursing home facilities in my health board area and I have no doubt the same is the case in other health board areas.</P>
      <P>There are many cases in which people are left on hospital trolleys as has occurred in Naas General Hospital in my constituency. Deputies on all sides commented favourably on the staff and bed managers who work so hard and, in many cases, above and beyond the call of duty to try to facilitate patients. The lack of privacy, particularly for senior citizens, is disgraceful to say the least. The modern trend may be towards mixed wards, but older people are entitled to a little privacy. However, they are being deprived of this entitlement on the many corridors in which they are kept when they arrive in accident and emergency departments. We must do something regarding this issue.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note the expansion programme for Naas General Hospital. The initial investment at the hospital was only going to create 29 or 39 additional beds, but we have examined this situation and a further development will create, I think, 97 beds in all. However, there is a problem in St. Vincent's Hospital where geriatric patients cannot be moved from the accident and emergency wards because of an industrial dispute. This dispute has been going on for a number of weeks yet we do not seem to be able to resolve it. The dispute is preventing us from dealing with the accident and emergency department in Naas General Hospital because the health board does not have the necessary respite care facilities, particularly for senior citizens, who could be moved to Athy as the second stage of their convalescence. This would ensure that they receive the proper treatment before going back to their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of the new systems regarding GPs. I have continually raised with the health board the issue of locums or others acting for GPs. In many cases, the patient's records are not available to the doctor. This issue is creating <Col N="339" /> problems because doctors are afraid to deal with patients and send them to accident and emergency departments, thereby creating further overcrowding. There is a need to look at respite and nursing home facilities as this is creating many of the problems in accident and emergency departments because these unfortunate people cannot move on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for giving me time to contribute to this debate. The severe problems in accident and emergency departments are symptomatic of a deeper malaise in our health service. On many occasions I have pointed out that the legacy of the Government is private affluence and public squalor. This is reflected, not just in our health service, but also in education, housing and public transport, or the lack of it.</P>
      <P>The Green party will raise standards in our public health service by creating single waiting lists in public hospitals, standardising the cost of health related procedures, phasing out private practice in public hospitals and reassigning funding which is currently going to private practice to the public health service. We will create smaller hospitals and clinics closer to the patients served so that people will be treated as near as possible to where they live.</P>
      <P>We will also introduce local multidisciplinary health clinics staffed by GPs, nurses, midwives and specialist and alternative practitioners which will relieve congestion in our casualty departments. A strong emphasis will be placed on outreach services from these clinics, recognising that the preferred place of residence for those in need of care is often at home.</P>
      <P>The Green Party will oversee the establishment of an office for an ombudsman dealing specifically with issues relating to health and with powers reinforced by legislation. The ombudsman will deal with matters such as access to health related information, waiting lists and problems regarding communication with medical professionals.</P>
      <P>The Green Party will also support the continuing availability to the public of traditional, herbal and homeopathic remedies. We will review the functions and recommendations of the Irish Medicines Board in relation to these remedies and assess the need to establish a separate traditional medicines board. We will introduce a proper system of registration and regulation of alternative health practitioners. In addition, we will support the wider introduction of information technology within the health services to modernise and improve service delivery. A range of health and telemedicine initiatives will be piloted particularly within the primary health care services, including remote Internet consultations with experts for rural GPs, supervised access for patients to up-to-date health information and virtual support groups for patients with specific diagnoses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Green Party is concerned, every citizen is entitled to a level of health care appro<Col N="340" /> priate to his or her needs, regardless of age or income. We intend to provide medical cards for all citizens. The scope of the medical card system will be widened to support a greater range of treatments, including some alternative therapies. These measures will be implemented on a phased basis with immediate implementation of medical cards for all children.</P>
    <P>We will also ensure adequate consumer representation at all levels of decision-making within the health services especially at health board and hospital board level. Patients' representatives will play a central role in health policy development. These representatives will be elected by the community fora currently operating in conjunction with local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the past many of the major improvements in health standards resulted from preventative measures. It is our aim to shift the emphasis within the health services away from high levels of medical intervention and towards empowering people to make decisions regarding their own health care. We will achieve this by providing better health education services and targeting adequate resources towards the promotion of healthy lifestyles.</P>
    <P>Health education will start at an early age. We will encourage a regime of regular health check-ups. We will also ensure the proper integration of environmental and health policies so that the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe are of the highest possible standard. We are facing a crisis in the health service. This Government has served us badly and I hope it will be pay back time at the election for the way it has let our public services run down.</P>

A total of 70% of all hospital admissions come through A&amp;E units and seasonal difficulties and strains in the system occur &ndash; that is acknowledged by the Government. Everyone should acknowledge, however, that the Government has put in place a solid policy basis for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the core of those policies is the health strategy arrived at through negotiation in partnership with the public, nurses, doctors and all the health professionals. Together we agreed solutions to the A&amp;E problems experienced in the health services. These include the establishment of a 24 hour GP co-operative to treat patients who would normally attend A&amp;E departments; the appointment of additional A&amp;E consultants &ndash; 12 appointed over the past 12 months with funding for 17 more approved; the establishment of minor injury units to treat non-urgent cases normally treated in A&amp;E wards; and the reorganisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to and availability of services at busy times in A&amp;E departments. These policies are costed, specific and detailed. We are satisfied they can be <Col N="341" /> implemented to improve the situation in accident and emergency units.</P>
    <P>As a result of our bed capacity review, we will provide 3,000 more beds over the next decade. By the end of this year, 709 of these will be in place, allowing 30,000 additional treatments, thus alleviating much of the pressure on A&amp;E units. Last year we provided investment of &euro;40 million to alleviate pressures and to improve services in A&amp;E units over the winter months. This included funding for the recruitment of 29 A&amp;E consultants and the contracting of private nursing home places by the ERHA and the health boards. So far, 700 beds have been contracted, freeing urgently needed acute beds.</P>
    <P>We have provided huge increases in capital spending to extend, improve and develop A&amp;E units nationwide. In my constituency, the A&amp;E department in St. Colmcille's received funding to be extended and the new A&amp;E in St. Vincent's Hospital is being supported. The co-operation now developing between those two hospitals and St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire will lead to an improved service for the people of the area.</P>
    <P>In the same way as the problems in accident and emergency did not arise overnight, we will not solve them overnight. Based on the Government's record of investment, however, and on the plans outlined in the health strategy and agreed with the health stakeholders, the A&amp;E situation will improve. Where problems exist, it is imperative that we work in partnership with the hospital management, nurses, doctors and all stakeholders involved in the provision of A&amp;E services. That is the concern of the A&amp;E forum and why the Minister is urging the chief executive officers of voluntary hospitals and health boards to engage with the Nursing Alliance in every A&amp;E unit to improve the present situation. It is the focus of Comhairle na nOspidéal's review of A&amp;E services. All stakeholders are working towards a solution.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been achieved through investment, co-operation and new policies. We acknowledge there is much to be done but the partnership approach that has been devised is the way forward &ndash; it is the hallmark of this Government and I am confident we will succeed. Any Member can talk about individual cases; we all deal with the public and we are all aware of individual cases but it is important to acknowledge what has been done, what is being done and what will be done. These are not lofty, notional plans but plans that are well funded and based on the spirit of partnership. It is only through those that we can address the difficulties and strains in the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my gratitude and admiration, and that of many thousands of people, including Members from all sides of this House, for the statement by Dr. Patrick Plunkett at the launch of SIPTU's major health campaign. I read his speech more than once; it is one of the great speeches, informed by a powerful ethical, <Col N="342" /> professional commitment to health and to those in extreme conditions when they arrive in our accident and emergency units.</P>
      <P>I admire the speech for another reason &ndash; the way in which Dr. Plunkett has placed what is happening in context socially. In the last few years, the heart has been torn out of communities, where both parents no longer exercise the choice to work but where both have to work to fund a speculative housing situation. They are prisoners of mortgages. In addition, they are deeply stressed and this has removed from the community those who previously cared for the elderly and the very ill.</P>
      <P>Something else comes through in this speech. Not only does Dr. Plunkett refer to the destruction of community, but also the thinking involved in hospital care. When the doctor was giving a description of the people who arrived in A&amp;E and the circumstances that led to his resignation from the board of management of St. James's Hospital, he pointed to something else, namely the disastrous competition being set between those arriving in A&amp;E needing emergency care and those who need elective procedures in hospitals. He gave an example that will encourage young people to want to go into medicine, not only to deliver a set of procedures within a sickness industry, but to go into the health care industry, with all the connotations of the word &ldquo;care&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the phraseology and looked at the language of management in different discussions about health. Any concept of rights is missing from that discourse. A country lets itself down if it does not accept a model of citizenship with health care accepted as a right. EUROSTAT describes Ireland as the second richest economy with the fastest growth rate and second highest income in the European Union, but the second lowest provision for social protection. That is an indictment of the kind of society we are.</P>
      <P>The market will never deliver the rights or citizenship I have described. It will never do so and any representative of Government who stands, as the minor partners in the present Government do, and says that lower taxes give us economic growth has put his finger on it. I would pay higher taxes to have a decent health service, as would many people. It is an absolute scandal to suggest that it is possible to make changes in A&amp;E without facing up to the fact that a significant proportion of GDP must be spent on our health service. We should be seeking consensus on that matter in this House but no such consensus is being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of past performance and concentrating on what is happening currently, why are we on the verge of industrial action by those who have worked heroically at the coal face of the health service? They are taking such action because of the conditions in which they work. They are drawing our attention to weakness in management and consultation. Even when capital expenditure is allocated, are they consulted about the layout of A&amp;E departments? <Col N="343" /> In Galway Regional University Hospital, many matters have been raised with me.</P>
    <P>I will not refer to individual cases, many of which I know. There are also security and design issues, on which they have never been consulted. Other issues include staff structures, from nursing supervision level to the top, and resources. It is not possible to sweep away their concerns by saying fewer people are on trolleys today than a few weeks ago. Nor can these matters be addressed by providing for what may be termed a trolley dispersal strategy, where trolleys are moved from accident and emergency departments to wards.</P>
    <P>Dr. Plunkett is right to address another point frequently made that many who attend accident and emergency departments should not do so. Perhaps that is the case for a small number but the vast majority who attend are treated. Some have no homes to go to and, in that regard, we have torn the heart out of our society. For example, we have allowed people to own ten to 20 houses to generate rental income and these same people are invited to invest it in the private sickness industry. The Finance Bill has created a scandal by providing for a reduction in the number of beds required for new private hospitals to operate.</P>
    <P>What kind of society can allow that situation? In fairness, I recall Fianna Fáil Party members speaking of the need for a decent health service. However, where is the ethic today? Where is the principle of universal access, of citizenship and the right to be treated? Why have the structures of privilege in the management of the health services not been addressed? There is something degrading about hearing people speak of health in the same terms as they speak of other aspects of the economy, like at the Irish Management Institute's conference in Killarney. It is a dead language.</P>
    <P>A definition of care is required. Let us pay our taxes for a decent health service and let us structure it properly in terms of consultants' posts, career structures and so on. When designing new buildings, let us listen to nurses and doctors and those who admit patients. Let us listen to those who, late at night in the different accident and emergency departments, have to call the Garda for security. Let us put an end to privilege and ensure that the State accepts its responsibility. Is anybody seriously suggesting that advertising investment projects in private medicine as a substitute for the State's responsibilities will do anything? It will not.</P>
    <P>A long time ago I was a member of a health board for a number of years. In those days the situation was even worse because accident and emergency departments always suffered most in terms of cutbacks as consultants were not directly responsible. That has changed and I welcome the appointments that are to be made.</P>
    <P>Many of those who have given their lives to public service, including those in the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, <Col N="344" /> have been sometimes forced to defend the indefensible. If there is no State policy for universal access and proper care, how can a policy be delivered to those attending at night or as a result of accidents? There is a need for commitment and a policy that says it will be necessary not only to spend money, but to change managerial structures and define a new logic of management in health care. It is not possible to run a hospital or services of care or provide medicine in the same way as running a factory.</P>
    <P>Those from Connemara who attend University College Hospital often speak Irish and often have no homes to go to. They live in mobile homes and broken down houses. Many have no relatives. Even in Galway city, in a booming economy where people are paying 200% more than they should for a house, there are no relatives to look after them. All this means that it is time to realise that it is no longer acceptable to have a Government where the major partner calling the shots says it will continue to reduce tax irrespective of the chronic condition of the health service. Let us have a health policy and begin immediate negotiations to avert this industrial dispute and assist those who are heroically providing a public service in the most professional manner possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to this important debate. In the last fortnight a national newspaper reported the following:</P>
      <P>A Dublin hospital was forced to turn away ambulances for over two hours yesterday amid chronic overcrowding in its casualty ward. Shortly after 2.30 p.m. Beaumont hospital issued a protection notice, warning that its emergency unit could not cope with any further admissions. The decision was taken when the number of patients in A&amp;E reached 59, almost three times its official capacity. Ambulances were diverted to the nearby Mater hospital until shortly after 5 p.m.</P>
      <P>Patients who did gain admittance to casualty faced a long and uncomfortable wait. Thirty four were treated on trolleys while a further 25 queued in the waiting room. There was only one functioning toilet in the unit. The hospital's chief executive officer, Mr. John Lamont, said the crisis was so severe it could not get any worse.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of Third World health care we are providing at a time when the country is economically one of the most successful in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was astonished at the Minister's response to the motion. It is gratifying but hardly productive for him to concentrate so much on trying to rubbish Labour Party policy and spend so little time perhaps expressing a <i>mea culpa</i> and explaining why, after five years in Government, he has failed to deal with the heart of the health service, which is the crisis in the accident and emergency departments. This is where spare capacity is essential but far from that, there is an over stretched ser<Col N="345" /> vice unable to meet demand. The crisis is at times so severe it could not get any worse.</P>
    <P>On many occasions we have heard about the national health strategy. The Government should not spend five years muddling through, throwing money at the problem and then produce a strategy at the eleventh hour. Government works best when the reverse happens. As it is, there is now a health strategy but there are also various crises in the health service, especially in the accident and emergency departments. We all know that a health strategy will not bandage wounds, put anyone in a bed or take an x-ray. It is people and resources that provide these kinds of services for patients.</P>
    <P>Patients need the services that should be available to them but, most of all, they need their dignity. There is nothing more undignified for them than to find themselves in accident and emergency departments, sitting on chairs or lying on trolleys for days. That is not the way to treat people in a civilised country, yet it is the legacy the Government is leaving to its successor to resolve.</P>
    <P>I am very interested to ascertain the position regarding accident and emergency consultants. A beds initiative has been announced, but there has been no explanation as to why it has taken so long to fill the posts, especially the permanent ones. It is time the Government came clean on it. The problems are especially acute in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. Rather than elaborate on suggestions and proposals on health houses for general practices, time would be better <Col N="346" /> spent resolving the question of out of hours service by general practitioners, whether it be through co-operatives, on-call duty doctors or whatever. Has the Department of Health and Children even carried out an audit of what is available in terms of out of hours cover? It is quite clear that part of the reason there is such pressure on our accident and emergency departments, particularly on the north side of Dublin, may well be related to shortcomings in out of hours GP cover. Do we know if this is the case? I do not think so.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day we are presented with a <i>non serviam </i>by the nurses who are at the coalface. The Minister should listen to them and deal with their concerns and anxieties. Let us ensure that accident and emergency departments stay open to provide for patients who desperately need their services. At present there is grave stress on these services and the last thing we need for those departments is any kind of industrial action. From talking to nurses I know their only reason for taking this course of action is because everything else has failed.</P>
    <P>I urge support for our motion. It is important that a strong message goes out from this Chamber that we will not tolerate the poor treatment and lack of quality political intervention of which the Government is guilty. We want to see a strong, effective and speedy initiative to resource and provide for good management of our accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am annoyed and disappointed the Minister is not present. Where is she?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the last question first. I apologise for the absence of the Minister, which is due to her being out of the country on Government business. The Minister and I share the concerns of the Deputies about the adverse consequences for workers of recent announcements of job losses at various locations. These include announcements over the past week of significant job losses in the Cork region, for example at Youghal Carpets Yarns, EMC and SMTC, at Flextronics in Tullamore and at the Ardagh plant in Dublin. I am very conscious of the fact that job losses affect not only the workers but also their families and the economic and social life of the areas involved.</P>
      <P>In the immediate aftermath of announcements such as these, our priority is the mobilisation of the resources of State agencies to provide any assistance possible to those affected. The full services of the agencies of my Department are available to respond to such difficulties. These agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the county enterprise boards, work closely with the companies involved to address their difficulties and to assist the workers being made redundant in finding other employment opportunities. The State development agencies work closely with the county development boards and county councils as well as local development and other interests in areas affected by job losses to facilitate an integrated development approach and promote a favourable environment for business. Given the focused agency approach, in co-operation with company and local development interests, I am confident that these combined efforts will facilitate the provision of alternative opportunities for workers affected by job losses and strengthen the economic and social development of the areas affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ardagh plc announced last Thursday, 28 February 2002, that it was closing its glass container <Col N="350" /> manufacturing facility in Ringsend, Dublin. The reason given was failure to secure required improvements in work practices which, together with improved pricing, the company considered necessary to secure the future of the facility. A total of 375 people are employed in the plant. The Labour Relations Commission met the management and unions at the company this morning. It has put a formal proposal to both sides to enter a process of negotiations on a survival plan for the plant. The survival plan will involve major cultural and work practice changes to make the plant competitive. The company has agreed to the proposal and a response is awaited from the trade unions. The implications of the possible closure of this plant for recycling in Ireland will be the subject of an Adjournment debate later today involving the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The management at Flextronics, Tullamore, announced yesterday that it will be making 370 of the 440 employees at its Tullamore plant redundant due to loss of significant business from a major customer because of lack of competitiveness. FÁS has been in contact with the management of Flextronics and has offered its full range of support services. That support will include advising the staff facing redundancy of the employment or training of which they can avail. IDA Ireland is in close contact with the company with a view to providing any assistance possible in this difficult situation.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 1 March Youghal Carpets Yarns, which employs 200 people in the production of dyed yarns for the carpet industry, announced the closure of the plant due to the continuing downturn in the market for yarns, particularly in the UK and US. The Minister met unions representing workers at the company yesterday and following this, a meeting was arranged between IDA Ireland and the company for tomorrow to discuss a long-term viability plan. EMC Benelux, which is involved in the manufacture of information storage systems, announced last Monday that it would be making redundant approximately 150 of the 1,600 workers at its plant at Ovens, County Cork. The redundancies were necessary due to the delay in recovery of the ICT sector in general and the slow rate of investment in new IT infrastructure such as storage devices. SMT centre, Model Farm Road, Cork, which provides electronic contract manufacturing to the electronics industry, announced a significant reduction in employee numbers &ndash; 80 temporary staff &ndash; due to the appointment of a receiver to its main customer in the UK. The company is continuing to review its position in consultation with the employees and the receiver in the UK.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to see job loss events in the context of major growth in the economy and employment in recent years. Despite the temporary setback experienced in 2001, manufacturing <Col N="351" /> employment has increased in Ireland by almost 23% since 1989, although there have been falls in employment in other major economies such as the USA, the UK, Germany and Japan. There are also very encouraging signs that the policies being adopted by the enterprise development agencies to promote the development of more jobs in the regions are having a positive impact. Figures show that the share of new job creation in the BMW region rose to 25.3% in 2001 from 20% in 2000 and only 17.8% in 1999.</P>
    <P>The policies of the development agencies, which are to attract knowledge-based activities to locate in Ireland and to improve the competitive capabilities of indigenous firms, will continue to be vigorously pursued in 2002 and will be assisted by the improvement in international trading conditions which is expected later this year. The reduction in permanent employment in 2001 was very much confined to the electronics and high-tech manufacturing sector. Other sectors, including chemicals, food, drink and tobacco, wood and wood products and internationally traded and financial services, increased their employment levels. For example, employment in internationally traded and financial services increased in both Irish-owned and foreign-owned firms in 2001, as it did in the chemicals and food sectors.</P>
    <P>The increase in the level of job losses here in recent months is a consequence of the downturn of the past year in the US and global economies and the slump in the ICT sector. The situation was exacerbated by the tragic events in the US on 11 September. The rise in unemployment from historically low levels is expected to be short-term and good economic and employment growth should resume over the medium term. While the recent rise in unemployment was not unexpected in light of difficult global economic conditions, we should take comfort in the fact that our unemployment rate of 4% is among the lowest in the EU and that the level of long-term unemployment has substantially improved over the past decade and is currently at 1.2%. Ireland's economic performance in the current year is highly dependent on recovery in the international economy, especially in the US. As regards foreign direct investment, while some improvement in 2002 compared to 2001 is expected, it is recognised that this is critically dependent on recovery in the US economy and the ICT sector in particular.</P>
    <P>Trading conditions in key export markets will be difficult in 2002, especially in the first half of the year, and there is uncertainty about exchange rates between the euro, sterling and US dollar. While there are prospects for a modest pick up in trade and mobile foreign investment in 2002, it will take some time before this has a positive impact on the jobs front.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" />In responding to the current difficult environment, IDA Ireland is focusing on a number of key objectives including a more even geographical distribution of new greenfield investment; increasing the quality of foreign investment in Ireland by helping existing clients to move up the value chain into higher value products and services and into higher order functions such as research and development; pursuing high quality new investment that is in keeping with the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy; and promoting developments in the wider economy that enhance the business environment and, therefore, improve the capability to win high quality investment for Ireland, for example, infrastructure, skills, etc. The continued advancement of key developments in infrastructure, skills and education, particularly those set out in the national development plan, are critical if we are to be in a position to take full advantage of the upturn when it comes.</P>
    <P>As regards the promotion and development of indigenous industry, Enterprise Ireland is focusing on three key areas: sustaining support for research and development, leading to innovation and increased competitiveness&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not got them now. I mentioned that Enterprise Ireland is focusing on three areas: sustaining support for research and development, leading to innovation and increased competitiveness; market development and, in particular, initiatives for increasing the number of in-market trade promotion activities and continuing to increase the number of incubation centres and occupancy rates in key overseas markets; and an intense focus on arranging access to inter<Col N="353" /> national buyers. Other key initiatives include co-financing with the private sector webworks in key locations around the country and co-financing community enterprise centres in small and medium sized towns.</P>
      <P>Sustaining successful economic performance requires a rapid and flexible adaptation to new economic circumstances. In the light of the changed economic environment, action is required across a range of critical issues, for example, the cost environment for enterprise, infrastructure such as transport, telecoms, energy and waste, market regulation, public sector effectiveness and efficiency, education and training and research and development. These are priority issues which the Government is addressing.</P>
      <P>The Government's macroeconomic policies have had a significant impact on reducing unemployment in recent years and facilitating large scale growth in jobs and investment. The new national development plan is facilitating the dispersal of the benefits of economic and industrial development throughout the regions where considerable expenditure is being incurred on employment and human resource development and on infrastructure including public transport.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is fair to summarise his contribution by saying that the Minister believes that because of the job expansion Ireland has enjoyed over the past seven or eight years, we should now be content to lose jobs at the rate of 165 per day? Does the Minister acknowledge the gravity of a situation where, over the past five months, jobs have been lost at the rate of 1,000 per week? That is a haemorrhage of jobs that no amount of massaging can disguise. Is that all the Minister has to say to workers who have become unemployed in the midlands, for example, and their families, where there is little prospect of alternative employment notwithstanding anything the Minister said? </P>
      <P>With regard to the Irish Glass Bottle Company at Ringsend, has the Minister met either the union or, more particularly, the employer? Has he met with Ardagh plc? Does the Minister agree that this is a plant that must and will be saved? Is he satisfied that Ardagh plc is not engaged in an asset-stripping operation? Is this not a straightforward industrial relations impasse and does this company not have a number of viable jobs that can and must be saved?</P>

      <P>I am getting an up-dated position. The LRC is heavily involved at the moment and the Tánaiste and I are available to meet all parties at any time in the coming days if that is helpful.</P>
      <P>I gave a comprehensive account of the Government's attitude to what is happening at present and put it in the context of the agencies involved and what we are urging them to do. I talked about the efforts under the national development plan and the need to disperse investment in the BMW region. There is a clear-cut policy for the next Government, whoever makes up that Government, if it wants to pursue that approach. From my involvement with Enterprise Ireland, I know its focus and that of the IDA, which is in the Tánaiste's remit. Both the Tánaiste and I are very much in contact with those agencies and know that there is a clear focus.</P>
      <P>The general comment I would make, and it has been heard from others in Government, is that we are trying to achieve high-value jobs. That is the objective and something that we should all pursue. I mentioned the sectors that are growing and moving in the right direction and I also put the debate in the context of the unemployment rate that we have <i>vis-à-vis</i> other European Union countries. However, the Government takes seriously what is happening and is conscious of the impact that job losses have on individual workers and families. It is very much involved in the particular areas. For example, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, is closely involved with the Flextronics situation, as are other Ministers and Deputies across all parties and from various parts of the country where problems are arising. Our objective is to get the agencies to help out in every case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I bemoan the fact that the Minister of State has come to the House with very little in terms of a plan of action to stem the <Col N="355" /> increase in joblessness. Does he accept that in February the number of unemployed throughout the country increased by 4,500 and that in March that number has already exceeded 1,000? I ask the Minister of State to accept that, while he sits here holding a lengthy, rambling reply, inflation is rising and I ask him to further accept that this is home grown inflation that has nothing to do with the United States or the events of 11 September. Does he accept that the Government of which he is a part has this week increased the rate of VAT across the board by 1% and that home grown inflation and the VAT increase are contributing to the increasing costs borne by business and companies?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is engaging in no more than lip service when he talks about regional development. Does he realise that yesterday's announcement in County Offaly brings to more than 1,200 people the number signing on the dole in the town of Tullamore? Only last week the ESB pulled out of Rhode in County Offaly rendering another 110 people unemployed, with the consequent knock-on effect on Bord na Móna and seasonal workers. The midlands, a region to which the Minister of State said IDA Ireland is committed, is in essence an economic blackspot totally ignored by him and the Government. Has he checked the Minister's diary to know when she, the chief executive officer of IDA Ireland and his colleague, the chief executive officer of Enterprise Ireland, will visit the Laoighis-Offaly constituency with a view towards putting together a plan of action to deal with what is a very serious economic blackspot with higher than average unemployment and little in terms of hope? The Minister of State said FÁS is available to advise, but advice from FÁS is not what the families of Laoighis-Offaly want, they want replacement and alternative jobs which is their entitlement.</P>

      <P>On the Minister's involvement, I made it very clear that she met the unions representing the workers and following that, a meeting has been arranged between IDA Ireland and the company for tomorrow to discuss a long-term viability plan. I would again say to the Deputy from Offaly that if he looks very honestly at the situation in his county, he will see there are 13 international companies in the county employing about 1,200 people. He will also find that the unemployment figures in that same county fell by 25% in the lifetime of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will acknowledge that the proposed closure of the Ardagh plant is the second major blow to the Ringsend area following the recent floods. Was there an early warning system operating in the Department? Did the Department have any warning that this plant was in trouble? If so, was action taken by the early warning unit? Were there meetings with the management and staff? Were initiatives taken if the Minister of State had such an early warning? Will he give us details as to whether he had such a warning? </P>
      <P>The impact will be felt very strongly by other industries in Ringsend and by Rehab. What action is the Government taking to ensure recycling can continue in this country? As the Minister of State is aware, Irish Glass processes all recycled glass recovered in Ireland. Should the proposed closure go ahead, the Government will be faced with the huge cost of exporting our recycled glass to the UK and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I understand the workers were in negotiations right up to the moment the closure was announced and were shocked by the announcement. Will the Minister of State spell out exactly what the Minister has asked FÁS because he mentioned alternative employment and said that FÁS had been asked to look at an assessment of skills and alternative employment? Is there a commitment from Government to ensure this plant can continue given the implications of the job losses for the workers, the area and the environment in the event that the recycling facility, which is so essential, will not be available in Ireland?</P>

      <P>I indicated in my reply that there were issues of an industrial relation nature here. The Labour Relations Commission and the labour relations machinery of the State would have been aware of and involved in this. It put forward a proposal. I agree it would be desirable that there is a survival plan. As the Deputy will appreciate, that will definitely involve major cultural and work practice changes to make the plant competitive. The company has agreed to the proposals from the LRC and we are awaiting a response from the trade unions. There are industrial relations issues surrounding work practices. We want to see a survival plan. I mentioned FÁS and one clearly has to make plans in the context of things not working out, but everybody's objective must be to see a survival plan which will involve considerable changes.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that the spin put out by Ardagh Glass about the failure of employees to adopt new work practices is an insult to the workers who have bent over backwards to save this company? Does he accept the new owners deliberately let the company become run down and that despite this, it has been in profit in recent years? </P>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State to answer questions specifically on recycling. He said that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will answer this on the Adjournment debate but, unfortunately, we will not get a chance to question him closely. What assistance will the Minister of State's Department give to this company to maintain viable recycling because if he does not do that, it will cost this country a considerable amount of money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just seen a copy of the Ardagh plc press release. I am not in a position to make a judgment on what spin people put on various announcements but I presume they will put their own position up front. I accept that but my concern is that we try to move forward and get agreement. The LRC is very experienced in this area. In my experience as Minister with responsibility for labour, it has done tremendous work in trying to knock heads together, so let us hope it does that.</P>
      <P>Recycling is a very important dimension to this. We recycle over 30% of glass, which is at the lower end of the European recycling rate, so clearly this is an important element. The Department has been in touch with Repak to discuss the issue. Repak is charged with meeting industry's recycling targets for packaging and subsidising the collection of glass. There are lots of issues to be addressed but I am conscious the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will deal with them later this evening.</P>

Will the Minister of State comment on the fact that no warning or notice was given to the workers? What meetings have taken place between officials of his Department, himself or the Minister and the owners of the factory? What meetings are planned? How soon will this long-term viability plan come into <Col N="358" /> play? Why was such a plan not put into practice before now given that it was known that this company was facing difficulties? Is it true the Government has no interest in textiles? This is the last factory in the country dying and spinning yarn.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>On warnings, in this case the company advised IDA Ireland that it could not afford to pay more than the statutory redundancy, which it estimated at a cost of &euro;0.5 million. The employees have an average of 23 years' service and a number of employees will be re-employed on a temporary basis to ensure an orderly wind-down of the business. That was the thinking of the company. As I said in my reply, the management at the plant have put forward proposals. As the Deputy knows, the Minister has met the unions at the company and IDA Ireland will meet the company tomorrow. We are trying to establish a long-term viability plan. I can assure the Deputy that we will closely follow the developments and keep in touch with IDA Ireland. The Deputy will appreciate that we give tremendous support and encouragement to the agencies in question, primarily in this case IDA Ireland, to see a way forward.

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that Lowe Alpine Systems International in Tullamore recently closed with the loss of 220 jobs? Is he aware that Continental Financial Administrative Services in Tullamore recently closed with the loss of 50 jobs? Irish Casings, Tullamore, has closed with the loss of 30 jobs, Snickers Production Limited, also in Tullamore, has laid off 15 staff and Tyco Healthcare has laid off 19 staff. As the Minister outlined, Flextronics has laid off 370 staff. Leoni in Birr, which at one time employed up to 350 people, now employs only 15. At one stage Avon in Portarlington employed more than 800 people but it is now closed. Is the Minister aware that Rhode power station recently closed with the loss of 110 jobs, Ferbane power station closed with the loss of 100 jobs and Croghan briquette factory closed with the loss of 50 jobs? I helped bring many of those industries to the constituency and it saddens me to outline that many have closed in the past year or two. It is alarming.</P>

What special incentives will the Government provide in Offaly to attract industry? There has been a decline in our traditional industries and job losses in our new multi-national industries. Will a special level of grants, remission of rates and an extensive promotion of Offaly be provided? Will the Minister of State ensure that IDA Ireland and other semi-State agencies adopt a renewed drive to attract industry? Will he make sure that the business sections of our embassies are used to attract industry to the constituency?</P>
      <P>Rhode and Ferbane power stations have closed, but they were jobs the Government could have saved. The Government has to do something else to help provide employment.

As some<Col N="360" /> one who was born in the west, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that we have investment outside of the main urban areas. I am a Dublin Deputy but most of my colleagues in Dublin feel the same. Those who hold ministerial office have that same sense of responsibility and attachment to the areas the Deputy has outlined. Clearly we all share, as do my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and Deputies Fleming and Moloney, the sentiments and views expressed by the Deputy about families and those who are suffering at this time. We must move on and try to offer help. I made the point that the agencies involved, FÁS and IDA Ireland, will certainly do everything they can.</P>
      <P>I also made the point that positive things are happening in the Deputy's region. We often speak of the high value jobs that we are all attempting to attain through the training and education of our workforce.

Clear policy decisions that will have a positive impact in the short and long-term in the Deputy's constituency are being made. No effort will be spared by those on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation if he will outline the circumstances in which the contract for the national aquatic centre at Abbotstown was apparently awarded to a dormant London-registered shelf company; if he will publish all documentation relating to the awarding of the contract; if he will outline the findings of the report he has received <Col N="361" /> from CSID on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter in the House, especially in light of the various commentaries in the media in recent days. I also welcome this opportunity to explain to the House the position in relation to the Aquatic and Leisure Centre, which is being developed at Abbotstown, to be ready to host the Special Olympics Summer Games in 2003.</P>
      <P>As I have explained on a number of previous occasions to the House, funding for the development of this facility has been provided since January 2001 through the Vote of my Department. A year before that, in January 2000, the Government decided that the feasibility of developing an aquatic centre to host the Special Olympics Summer Games in 2003 be actively considered by Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited, CSID, the company set up to oversee the development of the stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project at Abbotstown. CSID subsequently commenced, in July 2000, an international competition by inviting tenders under the EU Public Procurement Directive to participate in a negotiated procedure to design, build, finance, operate and maintain an aquatic and leisure centre on the site at Abbotstown. Tenders were to be assessed by CSID, which was also the designated contract awarding authority for the competition. Eight expressions of interest were received.</P>
      <P>An assessment process, under the auspices of CSID, shortlisted five consortia which were invited to submit outline bids, on the basis of which three were selected to proceed to detailed negotiation stage. The consortia selected were Waterworld UK Rohcon with S&amp;P Architects, Dublin International Arena Limited and Prospero. Panels, including members of CSID, the Office of Public Works, the Irish Sports Council, Fingal County Council, the National Coaching and Training Centre, Special Olympics 2003 and an international leisure and sports expert, assessed the bids. Expert legal advice was provided by McCann Fitzgerald Solicitors and PricewaterhouseCoopers also provided a report on the bidding consortium.</P>
      <P>The assessment panel recommended to the board of CSID that the Waterworld Rohcon bid, which was also the lowest cost proposal submitted by some &euro;15 million, merited overall top ranking for the award of the contract. The Government, on the basis of the board's recommendation, agreed, in December, that CSID sign heads of agreement with the Waterworld consortium. These were signed by CSID, Rohcon and Waterworld UK on 22 February 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tender included a requirement to establish a special purpose company to operate the pool. Dublin Waterworld Limited was set up as the <Col N="362" /> company to act as operators of the pool on completion of the construction phase. This is a private company limited by shares with a shareholding of 4% held by Waterworld UK and the balance by three directors who already have an involvement in the operation of swimming pools in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Final contract negotiations, on foot of the signed heads of agreement, continued between CSID and the successful consortium through spring into summer 2001. In May 2001, my Department, in consultation with its legal and technical advisers on the project, agreed to CSID's request for approval to issue a letter of intent. The purpose of this was to allow work on the pool to commence pending completion of the final contract negotiations in order to meet the Government's objective of having the pool ready in time for the Special Olympics World Summer Games.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of these negotiations, and subsequent consultations with my Department and its legal and technical advisers, CSID late last year submitted final draft contracts as agreed with the consortium for formal approval prior to signature. Last January, the Government, on the basis of a memorandum submitted by me on the negotiations and resulting final draft contracts, approved the conclusion by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited of its negotiations with the consortium, which I am advised signed the contracts on 7 February last.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last, following a media inquiry, I asked CSID for a comprehensive report on certain issues raised in relation to the contract for operating the aquatic and leisure centre, including specific reference to the role and status of a named company in the tendering process and final award scheme. I received a response from CSID late last evening and, following consideration, sought some further clarifications which were supplied by CSID at midday today. In its report to me CSID has again outlined the process which it undertook in giving effect to the Government's decision to procure an aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown.</P>
    <P>Specifically, in relation to the status of the operating entity, CSID has confirmed that when the detailed proposal from the consortium which included Waterworld UK Limited was received, the assessment panel's recommendation was that this consortium based on all aspects of the bid, including design and price, should be selected as the preferred bidder. CSID insist that notwithstanding that Waterworld UK Limited was a dormant company, it was entitled under EU procurement rules to proceed as part of the bid provided that it was in a position to satisfy CSID that it had available to it the resources from a third party or parties on which it could rely in the performance of the contract, if awarded.</P>
    <P>CSID requested that independently verifiable proof of sufficient backing for Waterworld UK be <Col N="363" /> provided. This was provided to CSID on 7 February 2001 by way of a letter of comfort from Anglo Irish Bank, indicating that it was prepared to provide a &euro;3 million guarantee to Waterworld UK Limited in association with the national aquatic centre project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, the track record of the individuals identified as having responsibility for managing the centre was also considered by CSID to be satisfactory. CSID and its legal advisers are satisfied that the contract has been awarded in full accord with the bid received and in compliance with EU procurement regulations, and that the arrangements entered into between Waterworld UK Limited and Dublin Waterworld Limited are the result of normal business negotiations between the parties.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there are number of aspects about the handling of this matter which need to be urgently reviewed by the board of CSID. I have, therefore, recommended that the executive chairman call an immediate meeting of the board which has been scheduled for tomorrow evening. I will be asking for a full report on the outcome of the board's review immediately after the meeting before deciding on the further necessary steps which I will need to take in completing the report which my Cabinet colleagues asked for today.</P>
      <P>It is most unfortunate that such disquiet has arisen as a result of the manner in which this specific piece of information in relation to the composition of the winning consortium has come to the attention of the public and the Government. Despite the resultant adverse publicity, which could, in my opinion, have been avoided, I assure the House that the aquatic and leisure centre remains on course for completion by the end of December next, well in advance of the Special Olympics Summer Games in June 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm the date on which the project commenced and that a &euro;62 million project commenced without a final contract in place? Will he tell us what were the criteria in assessing the project? Can he give assurances that there was no conflict of interest between any of the assessment panel and any company bidding for the contract? Instead of waiting for a board meeting tomorrow, why did he or the Taoiseach not summon the director of CSID to get a full and detailed explanation of what occurred? Could the Minister also confirm that his Department had full knowledge of the details of the contractual negotiations, in light of the fact that he and the Taoiseach must have had a hands on approach to this as it was the Taoiseach's pet project? Had the Minister any reservations about the matter in view of the consultant's report on the capabilities <Col N="364" /> of CSID in dealing with a project of this magnitude? My interpretation of the Minister's response is that the &euro;62 million project commenced before a contract was in place. Will the Minister now seriously consider asking for the resignation of the director of CSID and the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked seven questions. With regard to asking for a resignation, the board is ultimately responsible and I have asked it to meet as a matter of urgency to examine the matter. I am examining the High Point Rendel report&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is examining it for the past three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because I have to meet the various organisations in accordance with that report. The Department had full knowledge of the contract documents. I regret that the matter of the shelf company was not brought to my attention, but I will explain that shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he had full knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I had full knowledge. Some of the directors of CSID have been summoned to meet me. As far as I am concerned, there is no conflict of interest. The contract to be signed between CSID and the winning consortium was a matter for discussion at Cabinet. It was carried on a letter of intent from period to period and eventually the contract was signed on 7 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of my questions were not answered. When did the project commence? Is it correct that the contract was only signed some weeks ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the Minister become aware that Waterworld UK was only a shelf company? Will he confirm that the PricewaterhouseCoopers recommendation, which was that it was considered essential that the management team of the organisation selected to run the centre has significant experience and a proven track record, was taken into consideration when awarding the contract? Is the Minister aware that Waterworld UK is a subsidiary of an American company, NBES, which will supply flumes and slides to the aquatic centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I discovered yesterday that the company was a shelf company, which I have already outlined. I regret that the Government was not informed that it was regarded as a shelf <Col N="365" /> company but I point out to the Deputy that there are many shelf companies with assets of just £4, £5 and £6, particularly in the UK. The Tánaiste has tightened up the situation here but shelf companies are not illegal and according to European Union procurement law, shelf companies can also bid for European contracts. Many American companies set up shelf companies here because contracts here are awarded under EU procurement laws&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is whether they should get the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;so it is not illegal for a shelf company to be set up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if we wished to kick out this company, we could not do so according to EU procurement law. The application by that shelf company had to be examined, so it is not unusual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not have to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Waterworld UK, I am not aware that it is a subsidiary of a US company but I know that American companies set up shelf companies here for the purpose of making contracts under EU procurement law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, does the Minister agree it would be wise to have the Campus Stadium Ireland Bill enacted, given the large sums of money that are being discussed and the huge profits to be made by those involved? Second, will the Minister agree that his discovery only yesterday that a shelf company was involved means that he did not have full knowledge of the contract? He might like to revise his previous reply in that light. Third, has the Minister had a discussion with the Tánaiste about this matter given that she is on record as saying that the report did not answer her concerns? Is that a matter which will require a statement from the Taoiseach, given his close involvement with the project? Fourth, can the Minister give any further assurance to those involved in hosting the Special Olympics in 2003 that this matter, and any fallout from it, will not jeopardise that event?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the building of the magnificent aquatic centre at Abbotstown is going ahead and will be ready for the Special Olympics in 2003. This matter involves the operating part of the contract. I am anxious to get the Bill passed as soon as possible. On the question of full knowledge, I was in con<Col N="366" /> tact with the executive director of the company on five or six occasions yesterday and today. As questions arose, I contacted him for further information. He was aware that it was a shelf company but because it had substantial financial backing, he did not think it necessary to inform the Government; I am not sure if the board knew about it. The company had substantial financial backing and, as it was in accordance with EU procurement law, he felt that was not necessary. I told the chairman that the Government should have been informed that it was a shelf company and I have asked for a special meeting of the board which will be held tomorrow night. I will await the report of the board and I am sure the board will raise these issues also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that, according to reports, shares in Waterworld are held by a company which is registered outside the EU, namely, in the British Virgin Islands? The share capital of the company stands at £98. One individual, John Moriarty, has a shareholding of £59; Kieran Ruttledge has a shareholding of £19; Liam Bohan has shares worth £15; and Waterworld UK has a shareholding of £5. What did each of those shareholders bring to the company?</P>
      <P>As the Campus Stadium Ireland Bill has not been passed by this House, Campus Stadium Ireland cannot enter into irrevocable contracts. Has the Government entered into a contract in this situation and if the Campus Stadium Ireland Bill is not passed into law before the general election, where stands this particular deal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what the individual shareholders brought to the company, they would argue that they brought their expertise. A number of them were involved in operating aquatic centres and pools in this country. I am aware that one of them also has experience of running such centres in the UK. These questions will be raised by the board, but the report sent to me by CSID indicated that this contract was totally legitimate and legal. I would like the Bill enacted as soon as possible. Parts of it are directly related to this type of situation and perhaps if it had been enacted, it would have avoided a situation such as this. I await the report of the board of CSID before making any further comments.</P>

      <P>I have heard different names and that this company is registered in the British Virgin Islands. There are companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. It is legal in some parts of the world to register companies in those islands. All we know about this is that it was done in accordance with EU procurement law. It is not unknown for American companies or other com<Col N="367" /> panies established elsewhere to set up shelf companies on the verge of Europe so they can apply for EU contracts.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that what we are experiencing is a classic case of stable door politics. The Minister is asking questions long after the horse has bolted, but they should have been asked well in advance of the signing of the contract.</P>
      <P>I want to ask him two specific points. Why did he, as Minister, recommend to the Government that a public contract worth about &euro;57 million should be signed with an unidentifiable paper company? Did he consider that prudent management? Who are the beneficial owners of Waterworld UK?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question that must be asked here is as a result of media speculation that indicated this was a shelf company. When I read what was speculated I was also a little alarmed because I did not know whether any other law or rules were being broken. It is not illegal for any shelf company to make an application for a contract such as the aquatic centre. I am answering one question put by the Deputy&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <P>The Minister is engaged in asking the most elementary question. Is it not the case that the Minister is now asking the kind of elementary question that any half vigilant Minister would have asked at the time this contract was authorised? Is it not the case, because this project is so politically driven, that the normal checks and balances that would apply in any tendering process did not apply here? Is it not the case that the vigilance that one would normally expect from the Department of Finance has not applied here, again because of the political railroading through of the wider project? Is the Minister seriously telling the House that the only thing that is wrong is the manner of the information coming into the possession of <i>The Irish Times</i>? He has told the House that is what is wrong about this controversy. That is the least important part of it.</P>

    <P Just="Center">&lsquo;476A.&ndash;Where an individual who subscribed, as part of the initial public offering, for shares in Eircom plc, has sustained a loss (&ldquo;the loss&rdquo;) and such individual is not entitled under any other provision of this Act to relief for such loss than for the 2002 year of assessment the individual may in computing his or her liability to tax take a deduction equating to the amount of the loss at the standard rate.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Deputy J. Mitchell).</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Mitchell: I was about to finish proposing the amendment when the debate adjourned. I leave it to my colleague, Deputy McGrath, to elaborate on the reasons for moving the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to a proposal from my party that ordinary shareholders who took out investments in Eircom should be compensated for their loss. It was amazing to see what happened within media circles in relation to this proposal. It appears the media rushed out to pass judgment on this proposal and that they are happy to support big business, regular investors and the well off against the ordinary shareholder who took out shares in Eir<Col N="373" /> com. Let us not forget that the Government spent in the order of £74 million encouraging people to buy shares in Eircom. Many felt they were being asked by the Government to invest in Eircom, it was sure and was money for old rope, as described by the Minister. They were encouraged to invest the few bob they may have had in savings, and about 500,000 did so.</P>
      <P>Given that the major investors, the pension schemes and the big companies which invested in Eircom could write off their losses against gains on other shares, why should the ordinary Joe Soap who took his few bob out of the credit union to invest in Eircom not be compensated in some way? They should be entitled to write off their losses in the same way as other investors. It makes a good deal of sense but it ties in with the direction in which the Government is proceeding. Speaking on earlier amendments we said the Government had rewarded the better off. It is happy to reward the better off in terms of the investments in Eircom and to decry any proposals there might be to look after the ordinary person. I am happy with this proposal from our party and second the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The level of resentment that immediately followed the announcement of the Fine Gael proposal was extraordinary. Instead people should have waited for the matter to go to the Finance Bill. One of the arguments put forward by the media and others and by some in Government was that if a person backed a horse and the horse lost, would they get the money back. I guarantee that if the Minister wrote to everybody and told them that Florida Pearl lost, they would be looking for their money back. That is exactly what happened here. The Minister wrote to everybody. The Government pocketed the money and now it is being asked to give back some of the money it got through hype and expenditure of £74 million. Furthermore, there has been a major cry about auction politics. I saw the Minister's name displayed on posters by one leading bank which read, &ldquo;God bless Charlie McCreevy&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the intention of this amendment is to give income tax relief at a standard rate of tax to individuals for the amount of capital loss sustained in the disposal of Eircom shares, provided the individual had subscribed to those shares as part of the initial public offering. The text of the amendment also provides that the capital loss will not otherwise be capable of being relieved for tax purposes and that a loss relief should be given for the 2002 income tax year. It is not entirely clear, however, if it is intended to give income tax relief only from the capital loss incurred on the Valentia takeover or how individuals who incurred a loss on the disposal of Vodafone shares, the shares received by Eircom shareholders following the disposal of Eircell, will be dealt with under this amendment.</P>
      <P>Apart from those who are actively and professionally engaged in trading or dealing in shares, gains or losses arising from share dealings come within the capital gains tax system rather than the income tax system. Our income tax and capital gains tax systems, which have co-existed since 1975, do not allow for the crossover of losses. It is not possible to offset capital loss against income for income tax purposes. As far as I am aware, that is the norm in most other jurisdictions. There is limited crossover between different categories of losses and income in our income tax system &ndash; for example, a landlord who incurs a loss on renting property can only set that loss against other rental income, he cannot set it sideways against any other income he may have. This amendment proposes to ignore such long-standing principles in the specific case of Eircom shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from undermining fundamental principles in the tax code, a measure such as that proposed in this amendment would be unfairly discriminatory. Many individuals other than Eircom shareholders have suffered capital losses on shares in recent times and they do not necessarily have other present or future capital gains to absorb these losses. It may also be added that the amendment does not deal with Eircom shareholders who may be outside the tax net. While targeted at the specific case of Eircom shareholders, this measure would inevitably trigger calls for special treatment from other investors who find that the value of their investments have fallen. Such requests would be difficult to resist if a high profile precedent had been set. Deputies Jim Mitchell and McGrath have put down an amendment seeking special treatment for persons exercising share options, but whose shareholding <Col N="375" /> suffers a drop in value on the market. If the case is once conceded, it will inexorably have to apply to all capital losses, with serious potential costs for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is undeniable that investing in shares is an undertaking that always carries a risk, as the price of shares can, and does, fall as well as rise. Compensating individuals for stock market losses, even in the single instance now being proposed, would entail taxpayers having to make good losses incurred as a result of stock market gambles by others. It is unrealistic to expect the generality of taxpayers to do that and it is certainly not equitable from the viewpoint of those who decided not to invest in the shares in question. Persons who decided to invest in Eircom shares did so for the same reason as any investor decides to buy shares, to make gains and earn dividends from their investment. Some Eircom shareholders sold their shares at a profit after the initial flotation while others now find they incurred losses. Apart from the considerations I have outlined, compensating the latter group by means of the proposal before the House would represent a commitment of Exchequer resources for which there are many more pressing and deserving demands. Finally, acceptance of this amendment would call into question the position of future flotations of State-owned companies. This could not be a one-off arrangement as a precedent for Eircom shareholders would inevitably compromise future Governments in relation to future State flotations.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy McGrath and others referred to the media circus when Fine Gael first outlined this proposal. I sympathise with the Deputy in relation to media circuses regarding individual proposals as I have been the subject of many media circuses as regards taxation matters. A number of my proposals during the past five years led to a circus as people who could not have been affected by any of my proposals were invited on radio shows to comment. I have a certain amount of sympathy for Deputy McGrath in that regard, but that is as far as it extends.</P>
    <P>There are a number of principles at stake, but the main one relates to the idea that capital losses can be offset against income, which involves switching from the capital gains tax code to the income tax code. Capital gains were not taxable in this country before the enactment of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, and high income earners could offset all their income tax by making capital gains, paying no tax on that and having little reckonable income from employment. The Fine Gael and Labour coalition Government of the time deemed the situation to be inequitable and introduced a variety of taxes, including capital acquisitions tax, which replaced the State duty, and capital gains and wealth taxes, which were <Col N="376" /> the first taxes of their type in this country. It also started the process of introducing taxes on farmers.</P>
    <P>The principle of capital gains tax is that if one makes a capital gain, one has to pay a certain amount of tax. The rates and thresholds have changed over the years, but the principle has been retained. It has not been established in this country, however, that one can offset capital losses against one's income which is subject to income tax. Deputy Jim Mitchell clearly said that he wants to offset capital against income for income tax purposes, but the logic of that is that gains made on capital should be taxed as income tax and, therefore, one should abandon the capital gains tax code. There are some jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, where that is the case to a limited extent. Although I was not a Member of the House at the time, I recall from the far-flung corners of my memory that it was considered here some years ago when White Papers on capital gains tax and wealth tax were published. I am sure Richie Ryan considered the proposal when he was Minister for Finance, and I may ask one of my advisers who I am sure can remember that time.</P>

      <P>It can be added to a small income in the United Kingdom to be taxed at the marginal rate and I think a similar system is operated in Finland. We decided to introduce a separate code, with capital gains rates and rules relating to capital losses, for capital gains tax. Matters such as betting winnings are excluded from capital gains tax, as I am sure Deputies Browne, McGrath and Belton are aware.</P>

      <P>We would have a permanent repayment situation. Many things are exempt from capital gains tax, such as a gain on a principal private dwelling house under the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975. I have changed fundamentally the rates of capital gains tax, but the ultimate logic of the Fine Gael proposal is that we abandon the capital gains tax code. If we allow people to offset losses against income for income tax purposes, the logic is that one adds the income from capital gains to one's income from employment <Col N="377" /> and the total is taxed at one's marginal rate of tax. Deputy McDowell has not said it in public or in the House, but he may favour that system. To be fair, I admit that it applies in other countries.</P>
      <P>Deputies have also asked why businesses are allowed relief in this regard, but they are not. I made some concessions regarding corporation tax losses on Committee Stage last week. The strict rule up to now was that a company making a loss of 10%, for example, was not allowed to use those losses against the profits of other companies in the group that pay corporation tax at higher rates. We dealt with this matter on Committee Stage, when I allowed Opposition Deputies a portion of a concession in the interest of equity, especially given that corporation tax rates have come down. Losses would be locked up otherwise. That is part of the corporation tax code.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, even in the income tax code one is not allowed to offset, for example, rental losses which are taxed under Schedule D case 5 against Schedule D case 1 or 2 income which is from a business or Schedule E rating up to PAYE. One is not allowed to bring losses across in that way even if it involves rental income which is taxed under Schedule D under what is called case 5 income. Those rules are fairly well established.</P>
      <P>Pension funds are exempt from capital gains tax and there is a gross roll-up system. It is the business of banks and other institutions to invest in shares. If I make a loss by giving Deputy McDowell a loan of £1,000, I am not allowed to write that off against my income tax bill as a tax credit, an allowance or a deduction when computing my liability. However, a bank which offered the Deputy a loan which he did not repay would be allowed to offset that loss. These are fairly simple and elementary principles which form the basis of both codes.</P>
      <P>I can see the reasons for their so doing, but if the principle proposed by the Deputies were ever established whereby one could move one from the other, the potential loss to the Exchequer would be enormous. I also pointed out that one could not confine this proposal to this flotation. This is the last Finance Bill of this Administration and there are certain impressions which have entered folklore regarding the Eircom flotation which I wish to correct. If we were to accept this principle, the future flotation of companies would automatically suggest a one-way bet. Who would not bet on such a flotation? One would be suggesting that people take the shares at any price because if they go up in value they will make a gain and if they do down the Government will compensate them. With respect to the Deputies, this proposal has not been thought out. If this is a vote buying exercise, it is not particularly astute. I will consult Deputy Belton when I go to Longford tomorrow. I travelled around the country a fair amount in the past six months.</P>

      <P>Certain things amused me at the time of the Eircom flotation. Deputy Mitchell stated on many occasions that the Government went against the advice of the Eircom board. Implicit in that supposition is that, in future, the board of the semi-State company, and not the shareholder, should decide the price. If Deputy Mitchell was Minister he would never agree to that position or his Cabinet colleagues would never allow him to do so. I will give the Deputy many reasons he should not do so.</P>
      <P>The Government is the shareholder and the Minister for Finance holds the shares in most State companies. In the case of the Eircom flotation most of the shares were nominally held by the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance held a small shareholding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if one goes back to the Greencore and Irish Life flotations, the shareholder, namely, the Government, in the person of the Minister for Finance, called the final shots in the matter because the Government represents all the people.</P>
      <P>About 550,000 people applied for Eircom shares. The population of Ireland is about 3.78 million. I remember it being said at the time that the price was set high. I was criticised immediately after the flotation on the basis that the price was set too low. I would not like to embarrass Deputies opposite by citing their colleagues who suggested that the price of the shares had been set too low because for a long time after the flotation the price was well above the issue price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial criticism was that we had given away the State silver too cheaply. The Government engaged two advisers who were paid substantial fees. The Eircom board also had advisers and about £80 million to £90 million was paid in fees for the successful flotation. That was a large amount of money. One of the advisers suggested a certain issue price and the other suggested a <Col N="379" /> higher price. The figure was more or less set between these two suggested prices. That was the correct figure because for a long time after the flotation, the price was well above the flotation price.</P>
    <P>Things happened in the telecoms industry all over Europe which depressed the price of telecoms and technology stocks. The Deutsche Telekom share price collapsed by a far greater percentage than the Eircom price. The Eircom board took one position, but it did not decide the matter. The shareholder, namely, the Government decided the issue for all the people.</P>
    <P>I represented the 3.2 million who did not have the wherewithal to bid for Eircom shares and who did not have the resources to go to their bank manager or other financial institution to take out a loan to buy the shares. I held out for the best price. For the best part of a year when the Eircom share price was well above the issue price, I read many articles in newspapers which complimented the Government, but which said it should have held out for a higher price. However, when the price went the other way I began to read articles which suggested that this was the fault of the Minister for Finance because he held out for the higher price. I make no secret of the fact that I held out for a higher price and I got a good price. I come from a part of the country where one gets the best price for one's bullock on the day.</P>

I could not possibly surmise how it got into the newspapers, but after the price went the other way it was the Minister for Finance's fault as he held out for that price. However, when the price was going up I was never mentioned in the newspapers. I am not blaming the Opposition for that fact. I did not hear any complaints at that time and I have not heard any since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1997 I have heard in this House comments about the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who has an ideology. It was suggested that I am the only member of the Government with an ideology and that I wish to pursue policy on this basis. I was criticised inside and outside the House for that. However, I was amazed by the fact that, as regards the Eircom flotation, Members opposite advised everyone to become little capitalists. People bought Eircom shares to unashamedly make money with which I have no problem. People wanted income and more power to them. However, it was a bit rich that people criticised capitalists on this side of the House for suggesting that everyone should get their shares <Col N="380" /> and that is what they did. However, 3.2 million people did not do so.</P>
    <P>A note was written in 2000 about the pricing of shares which suggested that the Government could have floated the company at a higher price, but chose not to do so. It also stated that one of the giant global co-ordinators for the offer, Merrill Lynch, advised a flotation price of £3.27, but that the Government set the price at £3.07. The other advisers were AIB Capital Markets whose figure was somewhat lower. In the immediate aftermath of flotation, the shares rose in price by 20%. The shares traded well above flotation price for most of the time since flotation. In the first nine months since the flotation, from July 1999 until April 2000, the shares traded at or above the flotation price in all but 12 of the 294 trading days. The average price at that time was £3.37, a premium of 10% on the flotation price. The price on the day was well offered and people had the best part of a year to get out with a profit. The markets have since tumbled in telecom stocks but I cannot be expected to compensate people for going in this direction. If we were to establish the principle that Deputies McGrath and Mitchell want to put into the capital gains tax code, it would be a bad day's work.</P>

If the Government loses &euro;2,000 with the millionaire, how is it just that a poor devil who owned only a few shares would cost the State money? Why is this argument used? Why does giving a break of &euro;1,000 to a poor man wreck the economy whereas rich people get it all the time? That is the practice. I did my best to explain that in my statement to the correspondent we all know in this House, an expert on finance who ridiculed the idea. No doubt he uses the existing system. Money can be taken from the Exchequer. How many non betting people were sacrificed by the Minister's reduction in betting tax and what is the difference between a rich man getting &euro;1,000 from the Exchequer and a poor man getting the same break?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;he never once explained how he can justify giving back &euro;140 million to corporate and rich investors in Eircom for their losses, because they are getting 20% back in capital gains, when he cannot extend the same 20% to people who are PAYE workers. He made no attempt to address that gross injustice.</P>
      <P>When I moved the amendment, I pointed out that those who make their living from capital gains pay tax at 20% on all their income. Those unfortunate enough to be PAYE workers pay 20% on the first tranche of their income in addition to the health levy, plus a PRSI contribution and, if they enter the next band, they pay 42% income tax. It is already the case that those who live off capital gains are paying 30% less tax at least than PAYE workers. How in fairness can the Minister have the gall to refuse to give the man in the street the same rebate that is already given to the rich? The Minister did not attempt to answer that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talked a lot of guff about this, that and the other. We know there would be wider implications for capital gains, and taxes generally, if this were to become the usual practice but we have made it clear that we are contemplating a once-off arrangement because of the particular role of the Government in this case. The Minister <Col N="382" /> got his highest price but he did so by not revealing the fact that the price was hyped by the shareholder &ndash; the Government &ndash; while it spent £74 million hyping the flotation, even writing to every home in the country.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister say that in all flotations the shareholder decides the price. He must be living in cloud cuckoo land. I do not know of any case where the shareholder has settled the price. If that were the case, the shareholder would always be looking for the highest price. It is normally settled by a board of directors, having taken advice, and the directors have to reveal all relevant facts or they find themselves in breach of the Companies Acts. The Government hyped the price secretly and withheld this fundamental information from the man in the street with no experience in investment. That is why in this exceptional case, we should allow the claw-back on a once-off basis.</P>
    <P>We also propose, although not in this amendment, to introduce legislation that would govern the future flotations of State companies and set out clearly the ethics and respective roles of the different players in such a flotation to restore confidence in future offers. If that is not done, fewer people than invested in Eircom will be ready to invest in the next State flotation, a strong argument for doing what we propose.</P>
    <P>It is intolerable that we should not give benefits and conditions to those who are much less well off. It is a simple case of social justice and fairness and of ensuring confidence in future flotations. The Minister addressed none of these issues in his lengthy and garbled reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister made several assertions that will not bear scrutiny. He spoke of the precedent this may create. It is not that long ago when a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance inserted in a Finance Bill a notorious provision the purpose of which was to exempt one person, who happened to be a Fianna Fáil supporter, from paying approximately £50 million in tax. The Minister should not lecture us on creating precedents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows it. If this amendment creates a precedent it will benefit the wider public and will not create special favours for our political supporters. It will cost, at a maximum, &euro;90 million and, in reality, it will cost less because included in that estimate is cover for all non-institutional and non-corporate investors. However, some wealthy investors, who are experienced in investment, will already have <Col N="383" /> received their rebate from their other capital gains.</P>
      <P>When moving the amendment I referred to those pensioners who borrowed to secure a nest egg to cover them for their later years or to cover the cost of their funerals. Having heard the urging and hype of the Government, many borrowed money from the credit union, yet under present arrangements they will not get the same concessions as multi-millionaires. The Minister also distorted the position when he said the provision would mean every time people make future investments they would expect the Government to make good their losses. However, the amendment merely provides that they will receive a tax refund of 20%, which means they will still carry a loss of 80%. The Minister seeks to create the impression we are proposing to return the full amount of losses to those gullible enough to listen to him and the Minster for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>My party is committed to this provision. Unlike the Government, we are committed to the precepts of social justice. However unpopular the cause, if social justice requires action we will fearlessly stand over it because we are not in politics merely to follow but to lead and, above all, to achieve social justice. Earlier in this debate and on Second and Committee Stages, speaker after speaker asked how, after seven years of incredible economic growth, so many of the poor and less well off have been left with their problems unaddressed. Why are widows and those living alone on sickness benefits living on approximately £90 per week? They cannot afford to buy a pint or go to the hairdresser. Why are 20% of primary school students leaving primary school with learning difficulties &ndash; when in three quarters of cases they need not &ndash; because of the lack of resources provided to the schools? Why are children waiting ten years for orthodontic treatment and why are some waiting so long they never get it? Why are the disabled confined to their homes because the Government would not provide &euro;36 million requested by all the handicapped societies? The consequences for these people is enormous.</P>
      <P>These burning issues of social justice have been ignored by the Government. Other Governments at least had the excuse that the resources were not available but this Government has no such excuse. It has squandered the money. The Government is spending £13 billion more than its predecessor when it left office, yet there is a litany of social injustice. That issue will face the people in the forthcoming general election and Fine Gael will be to the fore in pressing cases of social injustice. We will make no apologies for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" />In page 14, after line 50, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7C) Where payment of a service charge is made on or before a date to be nominated by the service provider (&lsquo;the due date') the amount of the charge shall be reduced by a proportion equivalent to the standard rate of income tax.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We did not reach a similar amendment on Committee Stage. My party is not in favour of service charges and in my experience in Dublin Corporation they have proven to be a bad idea. Unfortunately, in the corporation we matched the introduction of the charge with an attempt to encourage people to separate and recycle waste. This has not encouraged them to act in the way we hoped.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to allow income tax relief to be given at source. The Minister introduced a system last year to provide relief at source in relation to VHI contributions and mortgage interest payments. In this instance the relief should be provided at source and the charge should be reduced by the standard income tax rate of 20%.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the numbers who have applied for income tax relief on this charge? It would not surprise me if it was fewer than those entitled to apply. Many people are probably not aware that if they pay their service charges on time they are entitled to income relief on them.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also address the situation that applies in Fingal County Council, where a tagging system is operated that appears to be attracting the attention of the courts? Will he indicate how the already existing tax relief operates in the case of a county council, such as Fingal, which charges on a tagging and on a per bag basis?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment concerns section 6 and proposes that where service charges are paid by the due date the amount of the charge should be reduced by a proportion amount equivalent to the standard rate of income tax. Section 6 amends section 477 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, which already provides a standard rate relief for the payment of service charges. It is not clear what is intended by the Deputy's proposal. If it is to provide an incentive to pay the service charge by the due date to obtain tax relief, this is already covered by existing legislation in so far as charges are payable to local authorities. In those circumstances no relief is due unless the payment is made in full and on time with reference to such date or dates as the local authority decides. A similar provision is not included where the charges are paid to private contractors as it is felt that they would be in a better position than local authorities to ensure prompt payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If on the other hand a proposal concerns the application of a tax relief at source &ndash; TRS, as <Col N="385" /> the Deputy referred to it &ndash; this immediate relief would become a refundable tax credit. In other words, the relief would apply regardless of whether the individual had a tax liability. Such a proposal would be costly to the Exchequer and consequently I must oppose the amendment.</P>
    <P>About 28,000 taxpayers claim this relief and the cost of allowing tax relief at source for this group is estimated at &euro;730,000. However, this cost is not confined to new claimants in new charge areas, which is most of Dublin &ndash; we in Kildare have been ahead of the posse for some time. There was a major debate on this in Kildare and one of Deputy McDowell's colleague was involved in it &ndash; it was of major assistance to his winning a Dáil seat. The local authority notifies the Revenue automatically &ndash; some people might match up there as claiming it &ndash; but I accept Deputy McDowell's point that many people are not aware of it. Local authority charges will be higher because of the increase due to the cost of disposing of waste by contractors. That increase has to be passed back down the line so there will be more advocating of this relief. The proposal of tax relief at source would be more costly. This is a tax break at the standard rate and will be widely used in the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding the tagging system, the maximum charge allowable there is &euro;195 at the standard rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason it should cost huge sums of money if, instead of people having to claim the relief, they are given the relief at source. It happens in other areas. In my constituency, in an area like Cabra, 84% of people have not paid this money. That is what the city manager told the city council last week. It is always a problem. Many people will pay if everyone pays, just as many people will not pay if many others are not doing so either. I have argued for years about these charges. In the Dublin West by-election people in huge houses in Castleknock, with a BMW and Mercedes in the drive, said they would vote for the Socialist Party candidate, Deputy Joe Higgins, on the basis that they were being asked for £80 a year in charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to understand that this issue has an effect on some people. They have an incredible resistance to paying a local authority charge. I personally recommended that our Dublin councillors should not vote for it on the basis that if one introduced it the way it was proposed there would be huge resistance, which is exactly what has happened not just in Cabra, though I am using that as an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why can we not allow these charges to be collected as part of the ESB bill, for instance? It would greatly reduce administrative costs, it would make sure there is 100% payment, the <Col N="386" /> reduced administration costs could possibly be passed on in savings to the taxpayer and much of the political downside would be avoided. Collecting charges in this way is giving a present to independent candidates who will get on the bandwagon, regardless of the totality of the effect across the country.</P>
    <P>It may not be the only way to proceed. The charge could be collected with the telephone bill, but everyone has electricity whereas not everyone has a telephone. Has this method ever been considered? People will say it cannot be done as there are private companies involved but it could be done if there was a will to do so. It is more efficient and fairer, and more revenue would be collected. Charges might be reduced also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is basically to abate the cost, as the Minister said, and to give people a tax relief to which they are already entitled. Regarding the figure of 28,000, I do not know the total number of households or people who have to pay the charge and who would be entitled to claim the relief but it must surely be a multiple of 28,000. There are quite a few people who would be entitled to claim income tax relief on the payment on time of service charges but who are not getting that. There is no uniformity about waiver schemes throughout the country but in Dublin if one is not in the tax net one is not paying the charge in the first place and therefore there is no question of a refundable credit in the sense of someone getting money when they have not paid the charge. That does not arise in the Dublin system. This amendment recommends an administrative system which gives tax relief at source, to which people are entitled in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a similar experience in Kildare, which was the first area to make a big issue of this in the mid-1980s, and Deputy McDowell's colleague was involved. As Deputy Mitchell said about his area, the richest people in Kildare, who had two or three cars outside their homes, were turning up to protest at meetings, and I could not understand that. I wondered how we would ever bring back some form of local taxation, having effectively abolished rates on private houses in 1977. I could not understand the block people had against this, though they may have thought they paid enough in their income tax each week and that this was an extra taxation. However, if that was the reason then, it is hardly the reason now. Whatever one thinks of the methods by which I have dealt with this, most people would accept that the tax burden today is much lower than it was in those years. That excuse is no longer there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I despair of the possibility of ever having a system of local taxation. Deputy Mitchell suggested a method for the local authorities to collect this <Col N="387" /> and I can see no reason it cannot be done administratively. A little ingenuity would help to get it done. I do not know if local authorities have ever considered this but administratively it would not be impossible to use that system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not researched it but it would be an innovative way of dealing with this. There is tremendous resistance to the principle of having people pay local charges for local services. The problem with north Kildare, of course, was that Dublin had none of these charges. They were looking across the Liffey bridge in Leixlip and saying there are no charges on that side, and that created its own difficulties. However, we have become used to the principle over the years and Kildare and other counties run a waiver system.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment suggested a refundable tax credit. The tax relief at source system that I introduced for medical insurance and mortgage interest came in on 1 April last year for medical insurance &ndash; the mortgage interest measure came into force this year &ndash; and was intended to free up resources and make the system more simple to operate. It is working effectively and it has taken all the rubbish off the tax free allowance certificates or tax credit system &ndash; I intend to do more in that regard in future. Deputies can be sure that there was an estimate of the cost of doing this for everybody. However, one would take it that most people with medical insurance would be paying income tax, as would be the case for most people with mortgage interest relief. It would effectively be a refundable tax credit. I would not like to rule this out forever and a day, but I would hope to establish the principle that we would pay for local services &ndash; water, refuse or whatever &ndash; as we will not have effective local government unless local authority members have powers and are prepared to impose some form of local taxation. All parties have funked this issue over the last 25 years and I am not sure it will make its way onto the table in the next 25 years either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point in going any further with this. The amendment simply seeks to provide &ldquo;at source&rdquo; tax relief which is already available to people but is not being taken up by most of those entitled to it. What I propose is not innovative but simply a tidying up of the system. The arguments that applied last year or the year before in relation to medical insurance and mortgage interest relief would apply equally in this case. What I propose will happen inevitably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11) Where such sportspersons as may be specified by the Minister in regulations incurs expenses arising directly or indirectly out of playing or training for sport the amount of such expenses shall not be liable to taxation provided that no more than &euro;5,000 expenses shall be allowable in any year of assessment and provided also that it shall be assumed subject to such regulations as may be made by the Minister that a minimum of &euro;2,000 is incurred.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 12 of the Bill, the relief being given to certain sportspeople. When I first heard of this relief my instinct was to oppose it. I did not fully understand what the relief was intended to achieve. Having heard the Minister's explanation on Committee Stage I am still not entirely sure what exactly it is intended to achieve. It does not provide an incentive to people who would not otherwise do so to take up sport or to earn money from sport nor will it successfully encourage people who play sport elsewhere to play sport here. It will not encourage people in the same way as the artists' relief did in the 1960s and since. People will not be encouraged to relocate from other tax jurisdictions. The prospect of a lump sum payment ten years down the road, or further, is not likely to have that sort of incentive effect.</P>
      <P>It is in effect a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;. It is the Exchequer saying thanks to certain sportspeople defined in the Bill for what they have done and it will give now give them back, at the end of their careers, a certain amount of the tax they have paid. The difficulty is that it only applies to certain sportspeople. Evidently if a sportsperson is not paying tax or only paying a little tax during his or her career, he or she will not get much back. Even semi-professionals such as soccer players will not benefit hugely because they do not pay much tax on their sporting income. Ten years of tax reduced by 40% for the average League of Ireland player will not make him rich and will not benefit many of them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest outcry in the face of the proposal has been from GAA players. That is understandable because GAA is the most popular spectator and participative sport in the country. Many of those in the House have played GAA sport and most of us watch matches from time to time. <Col N="389" /> If this proposal is merely a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to people who have played, given pleasure to the public and contributed to the community over the years then it should be extended to those who have played or been involved in administration in the GAA. My amendment is not scientifically worked out but is an attempt to indicate a way in which the role of GAA players could be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said something I did not have the opportunity to take him up on at the time. I understood him to say that expenses incurred in playing sport could be written off against normal income tax liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a reasonably logical person the Deputy will understand that unreimbursed expenses are income. Expenses relate to expenses incurred and anything over and above that is profit which has always been taxable as it is like paying income to a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure I understand what the Minister is saying. Perhaps he will explain at greater length in his reply. I suggest we should presume that people incur expenses of up to &euro;2,000 per year. That would be a reasonable presumption. It is not reasonable to ask that an inter-county GAA player should keep accounts of a taxi here or a bus ride there, or income foregone or work overtime that could not be availed of because of playing football or whatever. I accept that if we allow that at 20%, we are only talking about &euro;400 a year and that will not make anybody rich. This would merely be a gesture from the Exchequer acknowledging the role these people play in our sporting life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, the purpose of the amendment is to acknowledge this is a major issue and serious hurt has been caused to people who play an important part in our sporting life. It is also to <Col N="390" /> indicate the view on this side of the House that this issue needs to be addressed. I would prefer that this provision had never seen the light of day, but as it is there we need to try and deal with it in an equitable way to provide fair play to all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 arises from the proposal by the Minister to give back to the super rich sportspersons of this country 40% of the tax they may have paid over a certain period. The Minister has targeted this relief at well paid sportspersons who have been tax-resident in the State. When they retire from their chosen sport, they will get back a lump sum. The Minister estimates the cost of the measure will be about &euro;5 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The proposal has created much discussion and comment and has created anger, particularly in the GAA. The Minister's comments on Committee Stage, when discussing the possibility of giving tax relief to GAA players, were read and commented on. There was a lot of disappointment with the direction of his comments about the GAA. Some comments were uncalled for and people were disappointed that he referred to the participants in our games, our heritage and culture, in this way.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Mitchell and myself suggests that, as a small recognition to GAA players who entertain thousands of people on a weekly basis, we should give them some gesture of goodwill in the form of a tax credit. Whoever wrote about our suggestion in the press did not properly understand what tax credits are &ndash; the Minister must not be doing his job properly &ndash; because they were quoted as tax allowances.</P>
      <P>We suggest that a tax credit of &euro;2,000 would go to the elite sportspeople who play our national games. In effect, that would reduce their tax bill by almost &euro;40 per week. We justify this proposal on the basis of the tremendous involvement of the GAA in every parish in the country. The GAA has not just kept people occupied, off the streets and interested in sport but has positively encouraged their involvement in exercise and team games. It is a very important part of life. We have estimated that the total cost of the proposed package would be about &euro;3 million. That is much less than what the Minister is proposing to give to the super-rich sportsmen of this country. It would be a small step in the right direction if the Minister approved this tonight and allowed it to be included in the Finance Bill. I am not certain that the actual wording of the amendment is correct but I hope we can obtain approval for the whole idea.</P>
      <P>It will be interesting to see how the Taoiseach reacts to this amendment. He loves to go down to Croke Park on a Sunday.</P>

      <P>It is important to recognise what the Minister has done over the past few weeks for our elite sportspeople. I want to be the first or second, or the 101st to take my hat off to them. They have all done themselves proud and done Ireland proud. We have benefited substantially from this in terms of tourism. However, we must accept that a number of them have made a substantial income and, to be fair, many of them would not know the difference if the Minister gave them the allowance for the past ten years. We are proposing a measure which is extremely important for the welfare of an organisation and the people who participate in it. It recognises the sacrifice they make. Kerry people may talk about the effort they make to get from one side of the county to the other to train. The Cavan team trains in Navan. Half of them are employed in Dublin and come down to Navan, which takes two hours. Thanks to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and others we have no train.</P>

Players from all the different counties work in different parts of the country. They take time off from work and go down to train on Tuesdays and Saturdays or Mondays and Thursdays and Saturday mornings, and they play most weekends. The reorganisation of the league structure means that they play every weekend from two weekends ago until 31 March. The Minister has stated that he has not talked to the Taoiseach about this, but has the Taoiseach an opinion on the matter? What did he discuss with the members of the GPA, if not something along these lines? I ask the Minister to accept this proposal and allow us to work out the details. Nobody in this House should be able to say that working GAA players are not entitled to the &euro;40 per week in tax credits that would be granted as a result of this proposal. <Col N="393" /> They provide entertainment week in, week out all during the summer from one end of the day to the other.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon had a distinguished sporting career before he went into politics.</P>
      <P>I have already made known my views on Committee Stage and I do not want to hold up proceedings here. However, with the feedback I have been getting from a large number of Gaelic footballers across the country about this amendment by Deputy McGrath, I am convinced this is highly acceptable to the rank and file of the GAA. This was one of the few elements of the Finance Bill that was taken up at the Minister's press conference and the Minister emphasised it to take attention from other things, as a good politician would do. However, he said one of the reasons he gave this concession was national pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no games more representative of national pride than hurling and Gaelic football. They are not an imitation, they are unique and distinctive. The GAA is the largest amateur organisation in the world. Only last week, when the bid for the European soccer finals in 2008 was failing, where had the Government to go but to Croke Park? I had asked the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on a number of occasions whether he would approach the GAA about opening up Croke Park, because of the upgrading of the surface, and he said he would not go near the GAA as it is an autonomous <Col N="395" /> body. However, the Government went to the GAA on its knees last week to get a commitment that it may open up the field by 2008.</P>
    <P>That was due recognition of the influence of the GAA. Across the country, the facilities the GAA has provided as an amateur organisation, by collecting money in local communities, is unrivalled. I have been all over the world and have not seen any amateur organisation with funding from its own resources providing such an infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We need to recognise that. People are very disappointed and I will not use exaggerated language to describe that. People feel they have been left out and treated as second class athletes. GAA county players who train all year round regard themselves as elite athletes in the same way as international athletes do. The Minister will not accept this amendment&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but he should. When the Minister announced this concession for professional athletes, I was surprised he did not at least give it to the athletes on the carding system, who are training full-time and verified by the Irish Sports Council. If the Minister had given this concession to those athletes, that would have satisfied a large number of the serious athletes in Ireland. The Minister could have done that for those on the carding system and for those in the GAA and we would then have a very good package for sport here.</P>

Voluntary work is what has kept this country going and will keep it going. That is evi<Col N="396" /> dent now that teachers are being paid to do the work yet will not do it.</P>
      <P>This issue is the same. Amateur players give of their time, the GAA is run by volunteers and they provide entertainment Sunday after Sunday. I do not have to remind the Minister that the Lilywhites gave great value despite the sacrifices they had to make. Mick O'Dwyer had to drive up from Waterville on a regular basis. That may be in a different category but it is impossible to insult players of intercounty standard who Sunday after Sunday provide entertainment for thousands. There is not the same commitment in any other sport and we are not talking about a large sum of money, it is a mere gesture. If we fail to give recognition to voluntary work, we will face difficulties.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell raised this amendment at the select committee last week. What he is proposing is essentially a tax deduction presumed against a person's total income from all sources for expenses incurred by certain sportspersons, to be specified in regulations, in playing or training for their sport. This is to be regardless of whether that person derives any taxable income from the sport concerned. The deduction will be subject to a ceiling of &euro;5,000 in any year with a minimum figure of &euro;2,000 to be assumed to be incurred for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Generally, in the tax code expenses are allowable only to the extent that they represent costs incurred wholly and exclusively in deriving income. In the case of employees, there is a further test in that the expense must also be necessarily incurred in the conduct of their employment. In the case of persons who earn income from their sport, any expenses incurred in playing or training will be, to the extent that they are not reimbursed normally, fully allowable for tax purposes against their sporting income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment would not help such cases &ndash; it may hinder them by imposing an annual ceiling of &euro;5,000 on allowable expenses where there is none at present. Persons who do not earn income from their sport cannot claim a deduction for sports related expenses against their ordinary employment or business income for the simple reason that sports expenses are not laid out for the purpose of earning their income. I made the point at the select committee, and I repeat it, that it is not possible to get a deduction against earnings where no such earnings exist. The net effect of Deputy McDowell's amendment would, therefore, be to give an annual tax deduction of up to &euro;5,000 to certain amateur sportspersons to the extent that their expenses are not reimbursed. Depending, of course, on the regulations referred to in the amendment, it may prove difficult to stop the extension of the tax relief to persons engaged in <Col N="397" /> sport as primarily a leisure activity rather than as a competitive activity. For example, by effectively providing tax relief for subscriptions to golf clubs, such relief would potentially be enormously costly and it is difficult to see what exactly it is aiming to achieve.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the introduction of relief for retiring sportspersons under section 12 of the Bill has prompted a renewed debate on the question of amateurism versus professionalism in certain sporting codes. This debate has been ongoing for a number of years. The question of whether to pay certain categories of sportspersons is one to be decided by the sporting organisations concerned and has nothing to do with tax relief<i> per se</i>. There are much more fundamental issues involved in such decisions.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 15 put forward by Deputies Mitchell and McGrath, it is not clear from the amendment whether this relief is intended as a tax credit of &euro;2,000 per annum or as an annual allowance at the standard rate or at the sportspersons marginal rate. While the relief is intended to be limited to Gaelic footballers and hurlers nominated by county boards, it does not appear to be restricted to senior inter-county players and is open-ended with regard to how many players each county may nominate. My unwillingness to give tax relief to amateur sportspersons has been portrayed in some quarters as a snub to the GAA and their top hurlers and footballers. As I explained to the select committee last week, the tax relief for retiring sportspersons, which I introduced this year and which is contained in section 12 of the Bill as initiated, is restricted to direct earning from participation in sport. It is wrong to suggest that it can, in some way, simply be extended to cover amateur sportspersons. It does not nor can it apply where no earnings exist.</P>
    <P>I am more than happy to stand on my record of support for the GAA. Indeed, I came in for a fair amount of criticism when I granted the GAA the equivalent of over &euro;25 million in 1998 to aid in the redevelopment of Croke Park. I am very well aware of the effort and commitment which the top players make to training and preparation and of the pleasure and enjoyment they give to the sporting public. During the discussions at the select committee, Deputy Deenihan described these players as elite athletes and I would not disagree with that description. There are, however, sportsmen and women in other amateur codes whose dedication and commitment to their chosen sport is equally impressive and who are also excluded from availing of this relief. The question of whether these sportspersons should be paid is entirely a matter for their governing bodies just as it is for the GAA with regard to its top players. I am not prepared to agree to this amendment either. Even if I was, it could not be limited to GAA players. Once a link between a <Col N="398" /> tax relief and sports income is broken, it would become difficult, if not impossible, to stop its extension to persons engaged in sport primarily as a leisure activity rather than a competitive one. This would be very costly.</P>
    <P>The GAA is already well treated in the tax code. The current tax exemption for the income of sports bodies was introduced in 1927 specifically for the games of Gaelic football, hurling and handball, and it was only in 1963 that it was extended to other sports. Where a sports organisation wishes to reimburse its members, whether players, coaches, selectors or referees, for bona fide and reasonable expenses they incur in attending training sessions, matches etc., those payments are not assessable to income tax. There is no set limit which can be reimbursed tax free in any year. It depends entirely on the facts in each case. In the context of amateur sports, the tax code should not be expected to contribute any more than this. I do not intend to give further tax relief in these circumstances as a substitute for salary and for these reasons, I cannot accept this amendment either.</P>
    <P>At the select committee, I pointed out what this relief is about. It relates to the income a sportsperson earns directly from sport and from direct participation in that sport. When a sportsperson retires after usually a short earning career, he or she will be allowed to have his or her tax recomputed taking into account that there would be a 40% deduction against directly earned sports earnings. If a person is able to arrange his or her affairs in such a fashion that he or she pays no tax as a result of other allowances and reliefs and no tax is paid in that year, when it comes to having his or her tax recomputed, he or she will get no tax back. It is based on the very simple principle that most sportspersons' careers are short-lived, whether rugby footballers, jockeys, soccer players or whoever. Two of the three people my friend, Deputy McGahon, mentioned will not benefit from this relief because they are not tax residents in this country and have not paid tax here.</P>
    <P>If one wants to talk about professional jockeys, I could name a couple of hundred fellows I have known over my lifetime standing on street corners in parts of Kildare and Meath without anything in their back pockets. Their earning careers were short-lived and they now have jobs which are a long way from the heady and glorious days when they were acclaimed by the public. These people had short careers and whatever money they made was spent at the time. They may have been injured or whatever and they had no earnings. This will apply to direct participation in sport and to the earnings people receive from that.</P>
    <P>As regards the GAA, I received a very nice letter from the chairman of the Gaelic Players Association asking me, on foot of its recent meet<Col N="399" /> ing with the Taoiseach, to set out formal clarification on a number of issues, which I will do. I would like to clarify the point regarding expenses. Expenses incurred are subject to the usual limits laid down by Revenue. People are not taxed on their expenses. If in any profession or walk of life one gets money dressed up as expenses, but which is over and above expenses, it is taxable. The idea of expenses is to reimburse one for expenses incurred. It is not intended that there will be a profit element. Whether the GAA addresses the matter of paying players is entirely a matter for itself, and Deputy Deenihan and others&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is nostalgia on the part of the Minister. I do not begrudge him that, but when the Minister sets his mind to doing something, he does so regardless of all the negative advice he gets from time to time from officials. In this case, the Minister found a way to help people who have had high earnings in the past. This follows a trend in that he is always able to find ways to help the rich but not to help those at the bottom. This is a consistent trend.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been mixing with the high flyers in the stands at the Curragh for far too long. Not only has he imbibed their style, he has imbibed their thinking. The Minister's sports proposal will help people who have had very high earnings in the past, but he has no regard for those, mentioned by successive speakers, who have made huge efforts at enormous costs to themselves. It is reflective of a clear trend. I am sure it is unconscious, but the Minister has drifted in such a way as to become the enemy of the working class and those of us who are concerned about social justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Members are aware that they are required to make declarations under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. Following a Private Members' debate on 29 November 2000, approximately 15 months ago, complaints were made by Deputies Quinn and Dukes in relation to interests which, in their view, should have been declared by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>The Public Offices Commission carried out an investigation in accordance with section 24(1) of the Act. In respect of the report, six allegations were made against Deputy O'Keeffe and he was found to have contravened two of them. Deputy O'Keeffe was found to have contravened section 7 by not declaring a material interest which he and connected persons had in the subject matter of the proceedings. That contravention was not a continuing one. However, it was found to be negligent and serious. In fact, the report stated that the contravention could not be said to be a minor matter, and that the contravention was at the lower end of any scale of seriousness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also found that Deputy O'Keeffe contravened section 13 of the Act in failing, as <Col N="403" /> required, to disclose the interests of his wife, son and daughter-in-law in the feed mill business. That contravention was continuing at the time and was found to be negligent, that is, not inadvertent, which would have been less serious, or reckless or intentional, which clearly would have been more serious. In all the circumstances, the commission ruled that it was a serious matter. The remainder of the allegations, of which there were four or five, fell.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe, in accordance with section 29(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Act, furnished a supplementary statement to the Clerk of the Dáil subsequent to that report.</P>
    <P>The role of the Committee on Members' Interests is outlined in section 28 of the 1995 Act. The committee does not have the power to alter, revise or otherwise change the findings of the commission. Despite the fact that the Act makes no provision for so doing, the committee decided to allow Deputy O'Keeffe to make submissions on his behalf. This was done in accordance with the rules of natural justice.</P>
    <P>Most meetings of the committee are held in private as many of the matters are personal to Members or relate to other sensitive issues. This was also the intention in regard to this hearing, and Deputy O'Keeffe's legal team was so advised. When the hearing began, it was pointed out that Deputy O'Keeffe had a preference for a public hearing but, as everybody here is aware, it takes time to put arrangements in place for public sessions and the hearing would have had to be postponed. The matter had already been delayed for 15 months at that stage and the Deputy was anxious to have it finalised.</P>
    <P>The sole function of the committee was to adjudicate on the appropriate sanction to be applied under the Act. There is precedent in this area, and the committee was obliged to take account of that precedent to ensure equity, balance and justice.</P>
    <P>The deliberations of the committee are entirely private. As the terms of the motion suggest, however, and without wishing either to reprise the submission made by Deputy O'Keeffe or breach the confidentiality of the deliberations of the committee, the fact that he had lost ministerial office weighed heavily with the committee. Despite this, the committee formed the view, on the basis of the determination made by the commission, that it would have to cause this motion to be moved. In fact, there is no provision in the Act to take account of any matter other than the commission's report.</P>
    <P>There are serious issues relating to regulation of conduct in the Oireachtas which bear revisiting in the future, and the question of self-regulation should be central to future deliberations in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" />I thank the committee members for having undertaken a most unpleasant task and for having observed confidentiality in this and all other matters. I assure the House, on my own behalf and on behalf of the members of the committee, that they will not serve on this committee if they are returned to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make this statement to the House. No doubt many Members, including members of my own party, will regard today's debate as an irritant at a time when there are other important issues to be dealt with. However, this debate is very important to me, both professionally and personally. It is important also to my wife and family.</P>
      <P>At the outset I want to outline to the House the findings of the Public Offices Commission into my alleged contravention of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 in December 2001. The commission was asked to investigate six alleged contraventions. It found that four were without foundation and that I had committed two breaches of the Act. Importantly, however, it found that the two breaches I had committed were not intentional. I repeat that as it is most important. The two alleged contraventions which were upheld by the Public Offices Commission were found to have been inadvertent, in other words, not intentional.</P>
      <P>What is patently clear to anyone who is interested is that I was not found to have committed a pre-meditated, wilful wrongdoing, deception or corruption but I was found to have committed two inadvertent omissions. The first was when I omitted to declare to the Dáil, before speaking on the Labour Party motion on 29 November 2000, that I had a material interest in the subject matter of the proceedings by reason of the fact that Ballylough Milling Limited, which is a family owned company, was licensed to purchase and use mammalian meat and bone meal and, second, that I omitted to disclose in my statements of additional interests that my wife and children had interests in Ballylough Milling Limited, as these interests constituted additional interests for the purpose of section 13 of the Act. I will return to both of those omissions later, but I must first outline certain important matters.</P>
      <P>I find myself in this position today because in this House I fall into the category of another head among all parties in this House, including Fianna Fáil. What is abundantly clear is that one is infinitely more expendable if one does not have sensitive information about times past and in the increasing tradition of Irish politics, mine was a case of &ldquo;Let's have the hanging, followed by the trial&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation which has led to this debate began in early December 2000 &ndash; some 15 months ago. I have absolutely no doubt that there was a concerted campaign to force my resignation as <Col N="405" /> Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The campaign involved a neighbouring family, a vexatious file, which included stolen documents sent to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, sensational allegations, planted stories, colleagues, very senior political advisers and a most willing journalist.</P>
    <P>As soon as I became aware of the allegations, I knew I needed professional assistance. I quickly came to the conclusion that what I needed was impartial, soundly-based legal opinion. I take this opportunity to thank both Donal Spring, solicitor, and John Rodgers, Senior Counsel, for their commitment, loyalty and moral support. Their contribution over the past year is greatly appreciated by all of us, including my wife and family.</P>
    <P>Sadly, I am absolutely satisfied that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Joe Walsh, behaved in a manner which questioned his integrity on several occasions but, suffice to say, I do not find myself alone in this view.</P>
    <P>No Government Department can function in an orderly and proper way if there are individuals intent on protecting mini-empires. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has suffered from such behaviour and the taxpayer has had to pay the price on more than one occasion. I must add, however, that there are outstanding public servants in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development who go beyond the level of public duty expected of them in their jobs, and I commend them.</P>
    <P>Once there was the genesis of a story, the media masseurs got to work with gusto and guile. The story was massaged, embellished and primed by senior members of Fianna Fáil and their masterful minders into an issue of national importance. The political pressure was skilfully, wilfully and, with masterful precision, communicated to the nation via a prominent journalist.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that this same journalist has displayed a curious loyalty to certain politicians in recent years. He has the ear of the most influential politicians, their minders and indeed their Law Library loyalists. If he is with you, then you can look forward to favourable treatment in a daily newspaper, on radio and sometimes on television but if, for whatever reason, he dislikes you, then you better watch out. Need I say more?</P>
    <P>We have now reached a stage in Irish politics where a journalist can be pumped and primed by the highly-paid unelected advisers of the most senior politicians as part of some agenda to sacrifice whoever, whenever and however. So I am another scalp, but who cares? Does anybody care about the mechanics and methodology of how it was achieved? Perhaps they do not, but they should. If it is me today it will be someone else tomorrow. I care passionately about the warped <Col N="406" /> way politics are being conducted. Wrongdoing on the part of any politician is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I now return to what the Public Offices Commission found against me. There were six allegations, of which four were found to be without foundation. Two were upheld, and these were deemed to have been unintentional omissions.</P>
    <P>In regard to the first omission, which was my failure to make a declaration of an interest in the subject matter of the Labour Party motion, it was well known to the Opposition that I was personally opposed to the Government motion which I was obliged by the Whip system to support. The motion itself was irrelevant because a decision had already been taken by the Government to support a motion at European level a few days later which would resolve the issue anyway.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the members of the Opposition who gave evidence to the Commission confirming my position at that time, including Deputy Upton, who is present, and Deputy Penrose.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second allegation of my failure to disclose an additional interest, I have at all times argued strongly that the meaning of this section of the Act is not at all clear. My contention in this regard was amply demonstrated by the failure of Deputy Quinn, the Leader of the Labour Party and one of the main complainants in this matter, to explain what additional interests meant when he was asked at the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn said: &ldquo;An additional interest is that in addition to, say, being a shareholder of a particular company that activities that you as an officeholder or an individual member of the House might be engaged upon would confer additional interest that would enhance the value of that shareholding&rdquo;. That is what Deputy Quinn understood additional interests to mean whereas they are defined in section 13(5) of the Act as follows: &ldquo;In this Section &ldquo;additional interest&rdquo;, in relation to an office holder, means any interest specified in the Second Schedule of which the office holder has actual knowledge of [and this is the important point] (<i>a</i>) the spouse of the office holder, or (<i>b</i>) a child of the office holder or of his or her spouse, which could materially influence the office holder in or in relation to the performance of the functions of his or her office by reason of the fact that such performance could so affect those interests as to confer on or withhold from the office holder or the spouse or child a substantial benefit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn's explanation could not have been more incorrect. Yet there is a proposal before the Dáil that I be suspended from this House because of my failure to properly complete my declaration in this regard, even though Deputy Quinn was Minister in the Department which introduced this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" />Deputy Quinn also made unfounded, appalling and disgraceful allegations against me in this House and elsewhere. One of the allegations he made, which was by far the most serious made against me in regard to this matter, was that I had: &ldquo;personally exercised my powers under the 1996 order and had refused applications for bonemeal licences and that given the very limited number of such licences and that one of them was held by my family farm, an application for the issue of additional licences must be seen as coming from a person in direct commercial competition.&rdquo; Deputy Quinn was forced at the commission to accept that this allegation was completely unfounded and without any justification whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I regret Deputy Quinn is not in the House. I say to him, in his absence, to forget about party politics completely and deal with this issue as a man. He should deal with it with honour. He should rise above the pettiness which subsumes him. I call on him to apologise to me publicly. He should be decisive for once in his life and stand up and apologise, or stay seated, but he is not here. He ran away and was cowardly again.</P>
    <P>I would also like it to be noted on the record that the commission found that I, as a Member of this House, had made the most fulsome declaration since the introduction of this Act. The same cannot be said for many Members present. A number of people were forced to make amendments to their declarations to this House on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>I accept that these omissions were probably inadvertent like mine, but it begs the question why I am being asked to pay such a heavy price for my omissions when no action was proposed or suggested against other Members in regard to omissions they made? It is my genuine belief that there are other omissions by Members of the House and by office holders past and present which have not come to light. It will be interesting to see how they will be dealt with in the future.</P>
    <P>The commission found that my two contraventions were not intentional. Such a finding puts me into the shade in comparison with the behaviour of certain individuals in this House. I have not lied to this House nor misled it and I have not been the subject of an inquiry. I will watch events in these areas in the coming months with more than a passing interest. I resigned as Minister of State a year ago and it has taken until today for the House to deal with this entire saga.</P>
    <P>Last week the Committee on Members' Interests conducted an investigation into my behaviour in private. Why was it held in private? I do not know. I wanted the hearing to be held in public. I had nothing to hide. I insisted that the hearing before the Public Offices Commission should be heard in public. I would welcome every aspect of the hearing being made public &ndash; my <Col N="408" /> case, how it was presented and, most particularly, how the decision of the committee was arrived at. I have nothing to hide, personally or otherwise. I think the whole thing was a joke. I went before the hearing somewhat sceptical about its objectivity, balance and belief in natural justice. I was not privy to the committee's deliberations during which this suspension was adjudicated upon, and that is regrettable.</P>
    <P>Should I have been so doubting about my colleagues? Should I have been so jaundiced? Sadly, I believe my concerns were fully justified. I will let the Members of this House make up their minds after hearing the following example. At the height of the superbly orchestrated storm about my behaviour in December 2000, there was a debate on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; which involved Deputy Howlin, deputy leader of the Labour Party. In the course of the discussion he said that my position as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was untenable. Deputy Howlin's name was attached to an amendment to a Dáil motion calling for my suspension as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Now Deputy Howlin, the expert commentator for the Labour Party, recommends a ten day suspension for me. Is it any wonder the profession of politics is so debased in the public's eyes?</P>
    <P>The impartiality of the other members of the committee is, I believe, equally suspect. Where is the honesty? Where is the objectivity? Where is the integrity? I will give Members my honest answer, it does not exist. This is the reason the committee sat in private, conducted its deliberations in private and came to its conclusions in private.</P>
    <P>Politicians sit as judge and jury for other politicians. That is fine for Deputy Howlin and his committee colleagues, but is he not the same politician who has a problem with members of the Garda Síochána judging other members of the Garda Síochána? How could I expect a committee made up of members with party interests, political interests and self-promotion interests to come forward with anything other than today's proposed suspension?</P>
    <P>I have already paid the price. I lost my job as Minister of State. It is what is called the &ldquo;resign or be sacked&rdquo; syndrome. My decision was achieved by highly paid advisers whose lives are spent feverishly pedalling mistruths, half truths and lies. I spoke to the Taoiseach on Friday, 16 February 2001 and told him of my decision to resign the following day, but as soon as the Taoiseach's ever-skilful advisers heard about my decision they ran to the media to say that if Ned O'Keeffe did not resign he would be sacked. The newspapers on Saturday morning so informed the nation.</P>
    <P>Later that day, as arranged with the Taoiseach, I tendered my resignation, but the picture had <Col N="409" /> been painted. I was resigning because I had been told that if I did not I would be sacked. Let me tell the House, just in case there is a doubt, I resigned of my own free will. Many of the Members present know that Ned O'Keeffe is his own man, but as I have come to learn, maybe rather late in life, the truth is not really that important to some people in this House or to the agents of people in this House.</P>
    <P>Those same individuals continue to meet and greet me in and around this House and their forked tongues make poor John Mills in &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo; look like an amateur, but then I am being encouraged to believe that it is just business, nothing personal.</P>
    <P>I stand over my record of 19 years in this House. The only thing Ned O'Keeffe can be found guilty of is working too hard for his constituents and his area. I will stand up for myself even on a day like today when I sense that colleagues, including party colleagues, wish that I would accept my hanging and stay silent during this trial.</P>
    <P>What more pain and punishment does this House wish to inflict on me? I know this does not matter much to many Members present, but it matters to my wife, my family and my loyal constituents in Cork East. Let every Member present remember that this matters an awful lot to me.</P>
    <P>I have given everything to politics for almost two decades. I stand over my record and am proud of it. I have taken nothing from politics other than the satisfaction of fairly representing the people of Cork East who matter greatly to me and whom I look forward to representing again and again in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputies, the decision is yours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal of Deputy Killeen, Chairman of the Ethics Committee. I say that as an Opposition Member and a member of that committee. I do not intend to comment on or interfere in regard to any of the references, the internal Fianna Fáil matters, referred to by the Deputy. This is a matter for Fianna Fáil to deal with.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House arises as a result of a decision of the Public Offices Commission. The procedure is that where complaints are made against an office holder, they are dealt with by the independent Public Offices Commission. The matter goes to the Ethics Committee only after a finding by the Public Offices Commission. I say that to make it clear that the findings in this case were arrived at by that independent body, which was set up under the Ethics in Public Office Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be a matter for discussion in the House, with a view to reviewing this legislation, as to whether it should be possible to appeal against such findings. If one looks at the Act, that is not possible. Since we, the legislators, have provided for complaints against office holders to be dealt <Col N="410" /> with by the Public Offices Commission, and we did so without provision for appeal, we have a responsibility and a duty to accept the decision of that independent Public Offices Commission. This brings me to the Ethics Committee, a small committee of five people, chaired by Deputy Killeen. During the time I have served on that committee Deputy Killeen has always had my full confidence and fulfilled the role of chairman with great impartiality and full integrity. I totally support him in that regard. The same can be said of the other members of the committee who dealt with this matter. It is important to say that the decision arrived at by the committee was unanimous. There was no question of party politics being involved.</P>
    <P>I understand the hurt and upset felt by Deputy O'Keeffe. It is an invidious position in which to be but if we are to have a system of self-regulation, where we deal with our own business &ndash; in this case the penalties arising from the decision of the Public Offices Commission &ndash; Members will have to be prepared to serve on the Ethics Committee and to bring that process to its conclusion. That is what happened in this case. It was on that basis that the Ethics Committee fully considered the report from the Public Offices Commission and the submissions made on behalf of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe in mitigation.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the committee meeting in private. In issues of this kind most people would prefer to have them dealt with in private. It is correct to say that during the course of the submission made on behalf of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe a suggestion was made that the matter should be dealt with in public. When it was pointed out that that would cause a delay, it was conceded it would be better to proceed in private. Arising from that the committee arrived at a unanimous decision, on the basis of which a resolution was tabled. On that basis we are here to support the decision of the Ethics Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a distasteful motion to have before the House because we are censuring and asking the House to suspend a Member. I serve on the Members Interests Committee. As the chairman of that committee has said, it is not a committee for which there will be a queue in the next Dáil because we are charged under the law to receive complaints under the code of ethics against Members. It would be much easier not to serve on that committee and much easier not to sit in judgment on any Member. None of the five will queue up to do that again.</P>
      <P>The House has passed laws to set standards of behaviour required of Members and set means for adjudicating on whether those standards are met. For office holders, it is not the committee of the House that determines whether the law of the land has been breached, it is the Public Offices Commission. Those standards have been tightened since the charges were made against Deputy O'Keeffe by the 2001 Act which came into force in December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" />Under the law the Standards in Public Offices Commission, as it has been titled since enactment of the new provision, adjudicates on a complaint against a Member. The Standards in Public Offices Commission consists of Mr. Kevin Murphy, the Ombudsman; Mr. John Purcell, Comptroller and Auditor General; Deputy Pattison, Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann; Mr. Kieran Coughlan, Clerk of Dáil Éireann and Ms Deirdre Lane, Clerk of Seanad Éireann. It was they who adjudicated on whether there was a breach of the Act and made the decision. All that was submitted to the committee to adjudicate on was the penalty to be enforced on foot of the decisions of that commission.</P>
    <P>I was a Member 15 years last month. I respect and admire virtually every Member and I have great admiration and respect for Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. I greatly resent what he said tonight about my integrity as a member of the committee, almost more so because I understand party political banter, and his slur and slander against the integrity of the other Members. Deputy Killeen is chairman of the committee. He is an honourable person and one of the most decent people I have worked with on any committee of the House. Deputy Flood is a most decent and honourable Member. Deputy Browne, who will retire from the Dáil at the next election and has served this country and his constituents well, is a decent and honourable man. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is another decent and honourable individual. None of us took satisfaction in any of this and none of us will queue up to sit on this committee again. We had a job of work to do and we did it to the best of our ability with absolute impartiality and total unanimity.</P>
    <P>For any Member who has been found by an independent commission to have breached the law to come in here and say it was a joke, that it lacked objectivity, is to run in the face of reality and to hide from the facts of the case. On the one complaint Deputy O'Keeffe has made about the matter being decided in private, most Members who are called before our committee would like their matters to be decided in private. We have adjudicated at some length on charges and found there were no substantive charges against a distinguished Member of the House. I am glad we did all that in private.</P>
    <P>Had Deputy O'Keeffe requested at any time, and given notice, that his inquiry should be conducted in public we would have been delighted to do that. That option was given to him on the last day he came to make submissions to us. We offered to adjourn because we could not go into public session at that early hour. We met at 8.30 a.m. to facilitate his legal team and we could not go into public session because there were no facilities at that time. We offered to adjourn to go into public session if that was what he wanted, but he simply said no, he wanted to go ahead. It is unfair to say that, and I make my comments in defence of the committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" />We have enshrined laws and new standards of behaviour for Members which we are all struggling to live up to. Many of us will fail. Many will amend our declarations, but we are all subject to the law. If we cannot enforce it in a self-regulatory regime, we will have to hand over the whole thing to an external regulator. Deputy O'Keeffe said I have double standards, that I want an external regulator for the Garda Síochána but that I am content with an internal regulator for Members. He was found wanting not by Members but by an external regulator, the Standards in Public Offices Commission. If he impugns the character of any of the individuals I have named who are members of that commission he will be alone in that charge.</P>
    <P>I began by saying I had great personal regard for a colleague and Deputy whom I have admired and respected, and continue to do so. Due and impartial process was observed in all of this. That Deputy Quinn made the charge in the first instance is a reality. That a general charge was broken into specific charges and adjudicated on by the commission is a matter of recorded fact. It falls to this House to decide, for the second time, on a proposal by a committee to take action against an individual Member who was found wanting in relation to the standards we have set ourselves. It may happen again, to any Deputy. We have to abide by the regulations we have set or abandon them.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat two-faced that Members of the House who will not vote against this motion tonight will put their arms around Deputy Ned O'Keeffe later and say it is dreadful that he has been so badly treated. As a member of the committee and with great regard for my colleagues who serve on it, I am sick of such double standards. If we do not live up to the standards in the law passed by the House, we should abandon them. We should not pretend to the public that we are setting standards if we are not willing to face the consequences of breaching them. My first comment on this motion tonight was that I take no satisfaction in the fact it is before us. I will not, however, allow my integrity and that of members of the committee who have such a painful and thankless task to be impugned by someone who was found wanting by the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>I hope this resolution will be passed, as it was a unanimous decision of a cross-party group. I regret there is a necessity for a complaint, but we have to learn to abide by the law in cases where Members do not declare an interest. That was the core of the matter which led to this motion coming before the House. We should strive harder to comply with the rules, while appreciating that none of us will be virtuous on all occasions. A good case has been put in mitigation by Deputy O'Keeffe's legal team and that was taken on board when the committee deliberated. I regret that this motion is before us, but we have to abide by the law. I hope Members will understand that this is a necessary action.</P>

      <P>This will probably be one of my last speeches in the House as I am in the twilight of my political life. Although I am sitting beside Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, I cannot say that we have ever been particularly friendly. We are acquaintances at best. I have chosen to sit beside him as I feel the punishment he is about to receive is a little excessive. On his behalf, I would like to say that he cast no aspersions on the Public Services Commission. He is quite firm in his conviction that he did not intend to do so, as I am sure Deputy Howlin will be pleased to hear. Deputy O'Keeffe has lost his State car, his Minister's salary and his ministerial pension is affected as contributions to it have stopped at a particular level. He has had to pay his own legal fees, which have been fairly considerable. No Member of this House is allowed to have legal fees reimbursed if they engage a lawyer on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Deputies who know me are aware that I believe in treating people in a humane manner. Deputy O'Keeffe's punishment is excessive and the House should consider the matter carefully before making its judgment. It is important to note that although the commission said the Deputy breached the rules, it was satisfied that his contravention was unintentional. For that reason, I feel we have imposed a pretty harsh penalty on him. His punishment may serve as a warning to other Members of the House to behave themselves, but I feel, to a certain extent, that Deputy Ned O'Keeffe is something of a victim of our desire to teach a lesson. I wish him well in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I wish all Deputies well in the years to come, although this is not necessarily my final speech in the House. I hope Deputies will demonstrate a sense of humanity in relation to this matter. We often criticise each other, but it usually stays in the political arena. We can be friends in the corridors, we drink coffee together and we talk about the issues of the day. Dáil Éireann is not as people perceive it from afar. I will not say any more, other than to thank the Chair for allowing me to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the important matter of the Mercy secondary school in Kilbeggan on the Adjournment. I express once again my severe and grave disappointment that the Minister for Education and Science could not find the time to come to the House. Matters relating to education and schools are raised night after night in the House, but the relevant Minister, Deputy Woods, never appears. It is not good enough and he should appear here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" />If he were here, the Minister would learn about the urgency of the situation that Deputy Penrose and I will outline tonight. If he is interested in providing a better education service throughout the country, he should come to the House to defend his stewardship of his Department. The Mercy secondary school in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath, has an enrolment of 174 boys and 153 girls, representing an increase of 15% in the last ten years. The staff complement in the school is 27 teachers and one will not find a more talented and dedicated group in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The school originated in a three-room building in 1894 and there was a plethora of additions to the campus in the early 1990s. A further prefab was added in 1998 to house the home economics department. The school has been allowed to develop in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and now comprises six different buildings on the site, with various linking corridors. The fact that 11 entry points to the school can be accessed by the public is a source of difficulty. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will appreciate that there are difficulties with supervision and heating. Pupils and teachers can have problems moving between the various buildings on wet days. Inadequate classroom provision makes specialist room allocation almost impossible. Sanitary facilities for staff and students are wholly inadequate and office and administration facilities need to be extended and upgraded. Physical education facilities in the school are very limited, as although there is a sports hall, no changing facilities are available.</P>
    <P>The Mercy secondary school in Kilbeggan is adjacent to the busy N6 national route, the proximity of which poses safety problems for students, parents and staff. Kilbeggan is an expanding town and the number of children in the catchment area points to a need for further expansion. The most recent census indicated there will be an increased demand for school facilities in the area in the near future. Kilbeggan needs a new school building on a new site. Such a development would provide the facilities needed by a modern school, such as science laboratories, an art and music room and language laboratories. I understand that a site has been made available for such a new development and an application for a new school has been lodged in the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister of State to tell the House the status of the application that has been made by the school authorities. Has it been approved? Is the Department ready to approve the new site and allow the project proceed to architectural planning? The students and teachers of the Mercy secondary school in Kilbeggan deserve a fair crack of the whip and I hope the Minister of State will give us good news.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important issue. Extra accommodation facilities are urgently needed for the Mercy secondary school in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath, a school of great historical import<Col N="415" /> ance which dates back to 1894 and is located in the heart of the county. The fact it is at the junction of the busy N6 and N52 roadways is a cause for safety concerns. I am deeply disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Woods, has never come to the House to discuss the matters we have raised on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The original three rooms in the school, dating back to 1894, were renovated in 1955. A metalwork room was added in 1964, two classrooms and two science laboratories were added in 1966 and a sports hall, a woodwork room and two other rooms were added in the 1970s. Three classrooms, a principal's office and an administration office were added in 1990 and a home economics room was added in 1998. As Deputy McGrath said, student numbers have increased from about 230 in 1985 to 327 today &ndash; 174 boys and 153 girls. The school is expanding and achieving tremendous academic results, which speaks volumes for the dedication and professionalism of the 27 teaching and management staff and the application of the students.</P>
      <P>However, there is deep concern regarding the age of the current buildings and the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of the development of the accommodation needs on the campus which consists of six different buildings with 11 different public entry points. There is also a major deficiency in the provision of classrooms and specialist rooms. Likewise, there are inadequate sanitary facilities for staff and students and inadequate office and administration facilities. In this day and age the PE hall, which everyone agrees is an important part of the provision of education, is totally unsuitable to meet the needs of the increasing number of students at this school. There are no proper changing facilities and there are leakages and so on in the building.</P>
      <P>The lack of social, recreational and assembly space is a major drawback. The parents of the students are extremely disheartened by the length of time it is taking to progress the building programme which is necessary for this school. The application seeking the new buildings was submitted in April 2000 and the school principal has completed all the necessary structural data records. It is time the Government took its head out of the sand and stopped playing with the future of our students. I ask the Minister to approve the necessary accommodation to meet the requirements of teachers, management and students of this expanding school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the application by the school management authorities for an extension to and refurbishment of existing accommodation at the Mercy secondary school, Kilbeggan, County Westmeath. The Mercy secondary school, which is co-educational, is the only post-primary school in the centre. Pupil numbers in the school <Col N="416" /> have remained steady in recent years and the current enrolment is 327 pupils. The application for an extension includes the need for a library and a number of specialist rooms, as well as the refurbishment of the existing accommodation.</P>
      <P>Before remedial or improvement works are approved for any school, it is necessary to carry out a long-term enrolment projection on which to base the school's future accommodation requirements. This process involves a detailed analysis of previous enrolment patterns at the school, together with projected output from primary schools in the catchment area over the next seven to eight years. Account is also taken of other factors such as significant housing development, if any, which might impact on the school-going population in the area.</P>
      <P>The process of determining the long-term enrolment for the Mercy secondary school, Kilbeggan, is well under way and consideration of the application has involved consultation with the school authorities. Information on recent and planned housing developments is also being examined in conjunction with projected demographic changes for the area and the County Westmeath development plan. The planning section of the Department of Education and Science will be in touch with the school authorities as soon as this examination is complete. At that stage the school authorities will be afforded an opportunity to comment on the long-term projected enrolment on which the Department will base the school's future requirements. Following from the agreement of the school authorities in this regard, the post-primary building unit will determine how best these requirements can be met.</P>

      <P>More than 30,000 people are treated every year in the accident and emergency department at Tralee hospital. This figure amounts to about 50 patients every day. Today ten patients were accommodated on trolleys in the corridor adjacent to the unit. There are only four cubicles in the unit. There are toilet facilities for men and women, but no toilet facilities for people in wheelchairs. It is often the case that people who attend the unit are incapacitated, perhaps due to injuries sustained in car accidents or other circumstances. There are no toilet facilities for such people. The trolleys in the unit are old and antiquated and need to be replaced. There are also problems with bed linen. Overall the situation is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of those admitted to the hospital have a referral note from their GPs. These patients expect to be treated properly and to be provided with a bed immediately. Such people have to be admitted through the accident and emergency unit and are left waiting on trolleys to be seen by a junior doctor or a nurse. In some cases these people go home because they feel degraded by being left on a trolley for hours or an entire day <Col N="417" /> with people passing by. This can lead to serious consequences in some cases.</P>
    <P>There is no accident and emergency consultant in the department. A part-time, temporary Australian consultant will be appointed on 18 March for three months and will be present in the hospital for three and a half days per week. He will spend the other day in Cork University Hospital which already has three consultants. Castlebar hospital, which deals with a similar number of people to Tralee General Hospital, has a full-time consultant. The same is the case in Sligo hospital which deals with about 22,000 people. Tullamore hospital deals with 25,000 people and has a full-time consultant, yet Tralee hospital does not have such a consultant.</P>
    <P>Tralee has suffered considerably due to the fact that it is tied to Cork in the Southern Health Board region. Kerry is on the hind tit of services in the health board region whether regarding orthodontic or cancer services, care of the elderly or whatever. That is not right and the fact that we are lumped in with Cork has not been good for Kerry.</P>
    <P>There are nine nurses and junior doctors in the accident and emergency department at Tralee hospital. These people are overworked and under considerable pressure. They work in pressurised conditions and are very stressed. These are great people who do their best, but they are becoming disillusioned and frustrated and they need help. The staff feel for themselves, but also for their patients.</P>
    <P>It is time the health board and the Minister addressed the situation at Tralee General Hospital. The unit has no consultant, registrar or senior medical staff. The Minister visited the hospital recently and made an announcement for which he received a standing ovation. However, after he left nurses and others at the hospital asked why he had received such an ovation in light of the fact that he had given nothing. It is time something was done for Tralee General Hospital. After five years we expect some announcement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. He will be aware that responsibility for the provision of accident and emergency services at Tralee General Hospital rests with the Southern Health Board in the first instance. Tralee General Hospital is the second largest acute hospital in the Southern Health Board region. The hospital provides acute general hospital services to the population of County Kerry and to a proportion of the population of west Limerick and north Cork. The accident and emergency department provides medical treatment for cases on a 24 hour, seven days a week basis and caters for up to 30,000 patients each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Southern Health Board the weekend of 22 to 25 February was particularly busy in the accident and emergency department at Tralee General Hospital. On the night of Saturday, 23 February, a number of patients were <Col N="418" /> detained in the department awaiting transfer to beds on the medical floor at Tralee General Hospital. These patients were facilitated on Sunday and over the period from Sunday to Monday night 11 patients were detained in the department. Of these 11 patients, one was transferred to Cork University Hospital on Monday morning and a second was discharged at 8 a.m. The remaining nine patients were all admitted on Monday 25 February. In total, 253 patients attended the A&amp;E department between 9 a.m. on Friday, 22 February and midnight on Monday, 25 February. Of that number, 69 patients were admitted to Tralee General Hospital via the A&amp;E department. All medical admissions via the A&amp;E department on the following Tuesday and Wednesday were accommodated in the hospital. The Deputy will appreciate that decisions on admissions of patients through A&amp;E departments are taken by the relevant casualty officers on duty in the hospital. A new consultant in emergency medicine is due to take up duty with the Southern Health Board shortly. This consultant will have a shared occasional commitment between Cork and Tralee. This new appointment, together with appropriate support staff, will have a positive impact on the provision of services in the A&amp;E department of Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, recently conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of that review, entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, which was published in early January, the Government decided to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. On 16 January 2002, the Minister for Health and Children announced a &euro;65 million investment package in the current year for the commissioning of 709 of these 3,000 beds in acute hospitals and these will come on stream before the end of this year. In Tralee General Hospital an additional 16 beds are included in this investment package. This represents an additional investment for the hospital of &euro;1.7 million in both capital and revenue costs.</P>
    <P>The 16 new beds at Tralee General Hospital will be allocated as follows: six additional beds for gynaecological services, five beds for the day surgery unit, four additional beds in the medical assessment unit and one additional bed in the intensive care unit. The increase in bed capacity at the hospital will help to continue the tremendous work which has been done over the last number of years in reducing public inpatient waiting lists at the hospital.</P>
    <P>The development of A&amp;E services nationally will be informed by a major review incorporating the operation and staffing of A&amp;E services and departments with a view to improving the provision of patient care. The review is being undertaken by Comhairle na nOspidéal and has involved extensive consultation with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards, <Col N="419" /> relevant voluntary hospitals, appropriate professional bodies and other interested parties. It has also involved an extensive examination of literature regarding A&amp;E services in Britain, Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. This work is at an advanced stage and the report is due in the near future.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined and the additional investment in Tralee General Hospital are clear evidence of this Government's commitment to the further development of acute hospital facilities for the people of Kerry and throughout the country. I agree with the Deputy, however, that a full-time accident and emergency physician is needed in the hospital.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Recycling Plant Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the concern expressed for the 375 people who have been told they will lose their jobs following the closure of the Ardagh glass plant. They are not just statistics, each of them has a life with commitments, mortgages and families. The shock of the news broken last week should not be underestimated. This is a blow to the pride and well-being of all of these people.</P>
      <P>The issue also has serious implications for the recycling industry. At present, the Ardagh glass bottle plant processes 30,000 tonnes of glass, the equivalent of 90 million bottles and jars, collected from recycling centres across the State by Rehab. Should the processing plant be closed, Rehab has expressed serious concerns about the future viability of glass recycling. The organisation has publicly stated its desire to see some form of Government intervention to ensure this form of recycling continues.</P>
      <P>Bottles are brought to Ballymun, where they are processed according to colour. The lids and labels are removed, the bottles are crushed and then passed on to the glass plant in Ardagh that is now due to close. For every tonne of glass cullet added to the furnace in the glass plant in Ringsend, energy savings equivalent to 30 gallons of oil are made. That puts into perspective what recycling does for the environment and demonstrates its value.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the success of glass collection systems. It is the easiest packaging product to recycle and reuse, although we still only recycle 30% of it. The Estimates for the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the coming year will provide an additional &euro;29 million to develop civic amenity sites for recyclable products but the system becomes a joke if we cannot provide the facilities to deal with the product once it is collected. Recycling is not just about collecting a product, it is about providing the facilities to ensure it is reusable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The threatened closure of the Ardagh plant, however, has serious repercussions for the recycling industry. Rehab has three options open to it now: it might not bother collecting the glass, <Col N="420" /> leaving it to be put into landfill, but no-one wants to take such a retrograde step; it could be shipped abroad but that cannot be done without a subsidy; or we can support the existing recycling industry.</P>
    <P>The announcement of the closure of the Ardagh plant gives rise to a serious problem. Glass products are easy to recycle but we will not be able to continue in future and this speaks volumes about our attitude to recycling our waste. This is a crisis and unless there is intervention, glass recycling will cease and there will be repercussions for other materials that can be recycled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Clune for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The announced closure of the Ardagh Irish Glass plant in Ringsend with the loss of 375 jobs is a major blow to the Ringsend area of Dublin, the workers involved and their families as well as to the recycling sector in Ireland. I understand the decision to close the plant was based on commercial considerations. All are agreed that higher and sustained levels of recycling are crucial to dealing with the increased level of waste which this country is producing.</P>
      <P>Glass recycling has been one of our relative success stories in recent years and many people have embraced the discipline of bringing their empty bottles to local bring banks. Most of the glass collected in the State has been recycled by Irish Glass &ndash; an estimated 37,000 tonnes last year. Our recycling rate is just over 30% of glass arising in Ireland but this is still at the lower end of the European recycling rates. The announced closure will make it more difficult to find markets for the existing tonnage of glass collected here and will be an added challenge in increasing our recycling rates to European norms.</P>
      <P>However, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has been in touch with Repak to discuss the issue. The Repak company was set up in 1997 as a producer responsibility scheme, charged with meeting industry's recycling targets for packaging, including the recycling of glass. To that effect, Repak subsidises the collection and pre-processing of glass and it will have an important role in assisting in finding alternative markets for the glass collected in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Short-term solutions to the problems created by the closure of Irish glass include the export of glass for reprocessing abroad and the diversion of some glass to a glass manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland. Decisions on these issues are primarily a matter for the glass merchants and the company involved. However, I understand a number of glass merchants have tendered to supply the plant in Northern Ireland with glass. The Department will continue to monitor developments in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the longer term the Department will work with relevant key interests to facilitate greater use of glass in the construction sector. Last year, a pilot road construction project on the N2 in <Col N="421" /> County Monaghan took 350,000 tonnes of green glass as an element of the bituminous mix. This was a useful experiment but it only absorbed a small fraction of the available glass. More extensive use should improve the economic viability of this alternative. The Department will work with the NRA and the construction sector to all suitable specifications to allow for a more widespread use of glass in both road construction and construction generally.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of innovative ways in which glass can be recycled, for example, industrial abrasives, glass wool and fibreglass etc., construction aggregates &ndash; for roads and other purposes &ndash; as an insulation material, filtration systems, landscape applications, coloured glass stones, ceramic glazes and so on. Part of this challenge is to find new markets for recycled material and the Minister's policy statement on preventing and recycling waste, which will be published next Tuesday, will address the measures necessary to develop innovative markets for recyclable materials generally.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Fishing Vessel Licences.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on the record that at 11.25 p.m. today the constituents of Mayo and Ireland could not say we are not serving the country and the cause well. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, should be on this side of the House supporting me on this worthy Adjournment matter. Those in the inshore fishing industry have been badly affected by the regulations introduced by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. I call on him to reverse his decision. Yesterday he went part of the way by reducing the price of tonnage by 50%. I call on him and the Government to postpone these regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that those involved in this area from north Mayo and in other coastal areas have a very difficult life. The Minister's licensing proposals will have a major effect on them. It will cost some of them between £30,000 and £50,000 to stay in business, which they cannot afford. It will mean them having to leave the industry.</P>
      <P>Those involved in the industry in the west and in rural areas were involved in a way of life. The Minister has fallen out with every sector in the fishing industry. I am disappointed he is not present tonight. Public representatives in Mayo have been lobbied by these people and I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, Deputy Cooper-Flynn and Senator Chambers have lobbied the Minister, as has the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Coughlan. I call on the Minister to abandon his proposals and to ensure that regulations be debated in this House. His proposals are illegal and it is wrong for him to introduce them without the approval of the House. If he does not withdraw them they will be contested in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" />Many families involved in this area have passed on their skills from son to grandson. As a result, generations of families will be affected by these proposals. A young man telephoned me today to say he had bought a new boat and tonnage last year. He will be disadvantaged by these proposals.</P>
    <P>In Spain, any vessel under 12 metres is not regarded as a boat. I have no problem with the safety regulations but I have major difficulties with the prices the Minister is proposing. Those affected cannot afford them. He is destroying an industry which provides the only work people in parts of my constituency, especially in the north Mayo area, can get.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State, as a constituency colleague, to pressurise the Minister to change his mind. Since taking office he has fallen out with every sector in the fishing industry, including the anglers, those involved in drift net fishing, draft net fishing and, now, the inshore fishermen. He is acting more like a dictator than a Minister. These proposals must be postponed and debated in the House before they are implemented. Let the House decide if they are in keeping with the regulations from Brussels.</P>
    <P>What is happening is wrong. We are attacking the small people and rural Ireland while the big fishing fleets from Spain and other countries are mopping up our fishing industry as we do nothing about it. The Minister took a step in the right direction yesterday when he cut back on the tonnage aspect by 50%. He should now go further and abandon his proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for his introductory remarks. The Minister regrets he cannot be present. I am sure the Deputy will agree he has done tremendous work in Europe and that when these regulations are finalised they will produce a good result. It would be useful to first outline the legal position with regard to the licensing and registration of fishing vessels and the reasons behind the introduction of the new scheme for licensing and registration of vessels in the inshore fleet. All vessels including those under 12 metres in length which are engaged in commercial sea fishing are legally required to have a sea fishing boat licence and be entered on the Irish and EU fishing boat registers. This is set down in EU regulations which, as the Deputy is aware, are legally binding for member states. Accordingly, it is not possible to exempt commercial fishing vessels under 12 metres from the requirement to be licensed and registered. In addition, the EU sets down capacity limits for all member states' fishing fleets in the multi-annual guidance programmes. In order for Ireland to comply with its binding limits the current legal position is that 100% replacement capacity must be provided before a vessel can be licensed and registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office the Minister has identified as a priority the introduction of new management <Col N="423" /> measures to allow for the development of the inshore sector. The inshore fishing industry is of significant economic importance to coastal communities all around Ireland: over 3,700 people are employed in the sector with 12,000 dependants and landings worth some &euro;36 million per annum. It is clearly a very important sector and he is committed to protecting and providing for its sustainable development into the future. He has already set up seven inshore committees around the coast with full-time BIM inshore development officers working with the local fishermen. He has also substantially increased investment support for the inshore sector and over &euro;2 million has been earmarked this year for initiatives for the inshore sector around the coast.</P>
    <P>In tandem with these initiatives, he has asked his Department and BIM to bring forward new proposals for the sustainable management of the inshore resource. As a first step he asked BIM to carry out a survey of inshore fishing activity around the coast. The survey found that some of the traditional inshore fleet is outside the legal framework. Before introducing new management measures he considered that it was essential to give bona fide fishermen an opportunity to regularise their situation. He accordingly, introduced the new scheme for the licensing of vessels in the inshore sector that allows fishermen to provide 100% replacement capacity in three instalments.</P>
    <P>BIM has held a series of information and consultation meetings throughout the coastal communities in relation to the scheme. Some reservations regarding the scheme were expressed at these meetings, principally on the grounds of affordability. Having reviewed legitimate concerns that have been expressed, he announced on 5 March that he would be seeking the approval of the EU Commission for proposed amendments to the scheme that would provide that vessel owners will only be required to provide 50% replacement capacity in respect of their vessel in <Col N="424" /> the context of the creation of a new inshore segment in the fishing fleet. In pursuing this approach with the Commission, he will ensure that the present position of the significant majority of vessels in the inshore sector, which are presently licensed and registered, will not be affected. Pending receipt of Commission approval, the 5 July deadline for receipt of supporting documents and the provision of one third replacement capacity is to be deferred. No provisional licences will issue pending Commission approval. The closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme remains 28 March.</P>
    <P>To abandon the new scheme, as the Deputy has suggested, would seriously undermine the future of the inshore sector. In introducing the amendments to the scheme which I have outlined, the Minister is responding positively to concerns raised while retaining the objective of having all vessels registered and licensed. He is confident that he will secure the agreement of the EU Commission to the changes to the scheme which he has already outlined. This agreement will enable bona fide inshore fishermen to become full participants in the effective and sustainable management of the inshore resource and secure their long-term future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 29, 30 and 530 together.</P>
      <P>As I have already advised the House, most recently on 30 January last, there are a number of initiatives being progressed during 2002, the first full year of operations of the new all-Ireland overseas marketing company, Tourism Ireland Limited, as part of the most radical shake up of tourism policy in recent decades. These include the establishment of a new National Tourism Development Authority to follow on from the operational start-up of Tourism Ireland Limited, the roll-out of robust and focused tourism marketing plans for 2002 together with a fundamental reappraisal by Tourism Ireland Limited of our overall overseas marketing strategy, ensuring the appropriate development of tourism products and facilities through the launch of a new tourism product development scheme, and working to ensure that a broad and competitive network of access links by air and sea to Ireland is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key challenges for 2002 and into the future is to ensure that delivery arrangements for those tourism functions remaining with Bord Fáilte and CERT are the most effective in helping Irish industry to achieve the optimum position for itself in the international marketplace, and so derive maximum economic benefit from the work of Tourism Ireland Limited. I believe that bring<Col N="426" /> ing together the product and human resource development functions into the one agency will provide the best delivery model for achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>Following highlevel consultations with Bord Fáilte and CERT, the Government approved last November the creation of a National Tourism Development Authority to promote the development of sustainable tourist facilities and services, including the promotion of training, human resources and marketing skills. Since then I have established an implementation group, chaired by John Travers, outgoing chief executive of Forfás, and including the chairpersons and chief executive officers of both Bord Fáilte and CERT and representatives of my Department. I have asked the group to develop a vision for the new authority; an organisational structure to deliver on that vision; an outline of the mechanisms to involve staff in that delivery process; and a communications strategy for ensuring a smooth transition to the new authority by the 2003 season. The intention is that the group, which has already met on four occasions and is making steady progress in its continuing deliberations, will report back to me in the next month or so.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, Tourism Ireland Limited and Bord Fáilte have recently launched comprehensive marketing plans for 2002 designed to address the new market situation. Tourism Ireland's programme budget of &euro;27 million for 2002 for the international marketing of the island of Ireland is the largest ever annual budget allocated for such a purpose and is supplemented by substantial niche/product marketing funding by Bord Fáilte which was further enhanced by the allocation of an additional &euro;11 million to Bord Fáilte for this purpose in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland has already launched a new and exciting television and print international advertising campaign for the island of Ireland, developed at a cost of approximately &euro;5 million. The company's marketing plans for 2002 are responsive and flexible in nature, with an emphasis on tactical marketing and co-operative initiatives with product providers, distribution trade and carriers to take account of the changing circumstances arising from the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>The focus on Britain, our nearest and largest market, will be particularly strong. They see a particular opportunity in the short break and additional holiday markets as Ireland is well positioned as a destination that is easily accessible by sea, particularly for the own-car segment. Tourism Ireland is also targeting a revival of the holiday market from continental Europe during 2002 through prioritising geographic markets, by selectively encouraging and supporting new access gateways and routes into Ireland, and by getting an increased number of operators to feature Ireland in their promotional activities. Specific initiatives for UK, continental and US markets are a day-to-day matter for the company itself.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, which will be operating in partnership with Tourism Ireland Limited, has also <Col N="427" /> recently launched its own complimentary programme of activities for 2002 which it will be undertaking on behalf of and in partnership with the industry. This will include an extensive promotion campaign in the Ireland market, both North and South, particularly from February to May and September to November, to encourage season extension; assisting industry, through Tourism Ireland's overseas office network, with the packaging and marketing of niche and specialist products such as golf, angling, heritage, walking-cycling, equestrian, watersports, conference and English as a foreign language; implementing the sports tourism initiative which is designed to win major international sporting events for Ireland, and utilising the promotional opportunities for Ireland arising from the positive media coverage associated with such events which, during 2002, will include the World Cross Country Championships, the Smurfit European Open, the American Express World Championships, and the ITU Triathlon World Cup Series; developing guidelines for implementing the recent Government initiative to expand regional tourism though festivals and cultural events; and providing a promotional platform for media and journalist visits from the various markets.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has had extensive consultation, including a number of meetings of the tourism marketing partnership, consisting of representatives of the industry, Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited, in the drawing up of these plans.</P>
    <P>Following state aids approval by the European Commission, I was pleased to launch the new tourism product development scheme in January. This will be administered by Bord Fáilte and involves some &euro;130 million of public sector funding under the Border, midlands and western and southern and eastern regional operational programmes of the national development plan. The overall objective of this scheme is the development of the tourism product in a sustainable way, that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>The scheme includes three categories as follows: the development of major attractors and clusters of attractors; the development of special interest pursuits; and tourism environmental management. The first two of these categories are targeted specifically at regions that are under-performing in terms of tourism development, and are designed to help such regions to achieve their tourism potential. The successful realisation of the measures is, however, dependent on, and directly related to, the delivery by relevant local and other authorities of the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls.</P>
    <P>Competitive access links by air and sea to Ireland will be every bit as critical in 2002 as in previous years. We are particularly well served by the levels of investment in recent years in sea access, which has seen the emergence of a high <Col N="428" /> quality and competitive route network, in particular across the Irish Sea and to France. My Department has been working closely with the Department of Public Enterprise to safeguard as much of the air access route infrastructure as possible so that, as traveller confidence is restored and as the recovery comes, we will be best placed to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The extension by Aer Rianta of its incentive scheme for new routes to Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports is very encouraging and I welcome recent announcements of new air services for 2002 which will go some way to compensating for the loss of services arising from the shakeout of the airline sector arising from the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>I also very much welcomed the request by the Minister for Public Enterprise of Aer Rianta in early February to proceed immediately with the provision of a rapid turn-around facility at Dublin Airport to meet the specific needs of carriers operating at the lower fares end of the market. The Minister for Public Enterprise is closely monitoring this project to ensure that Aer Rianta provides the facility at the lowest possible cost; takes full account of the needs of the low fares carriers and has the facility operational in good time for the 2003 season.</P>
    <P>Such a facility represents an important breakthrough in air access by offering new opportunities to carriers in that category to open new routes and services into Ireland from Britain and continental Europe and will be particularly important in encouraging increased access from Europe. The State tourism agencies will continue to work with the air carriers and with Aer Rianta to market existing and new services which I hope will arise out of this decision, and I have already asked Tourism Ireland Limited to ensure greater co-ordination and co-operation in marketing activities with the airlines and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has matured greatly in recent years and has built up a tremendous product base that makes Ireland a very attractive international tourist destination. I welcome the response of many businesses in the sector that are already readjusting their marketing and pricing strategies to secure extra businesses in the current difficult climate. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the continuing need to maintain competitiveness and keep prices as attractive as possible. I am confident that the recent attractively priced offers from the air and sea carriers, accommodation providers and others will play a key role in helping the industry to work its way out of current difficulties.</P>
    <P>On 27 February last I met a delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation whose members presented their report, A Recovery Programme for Tourism. In the course of the meeting, the ITIC representatives outlined their assessment of recent tourism performance, the challenges facing the industry in the aftermath of last year's crises, and their proposals for reversing the decline suffered by Irish tourism as a direct result of those crises. My Department is finalising <Col N="429" /> its consideration of the ITIC submission and I expect to be in a position to issue a formal response to the confederation very shortly setting out our policy position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>Last November, the Government approved the creation of a new national tourism development authority whose remit is to include the promotion of training, human resource and marketing skills development in the tourism industry and other functions carried out by Bord Fáilte and CERT. The Government also approved the drafting of a Bill to provide the statutory basis for the new authority. The draft Bill is being prepared in the Attorney General's office and it has not yet given us an expected date for completion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, I have established an implementation group, chaired by John Travers, outgoing chief executive of Forfás, and including the chairpersons and chief executive officers of both Bord Fáilte and CERT and representatives of my Department. I have asked the group to consider a vision for the new authority; an organisational structure to deliver on that vision; an outline of the mechanisms to involve staff in that delivery process; and a communications strategy for ensuring a smooth transition to the new authority by the 2003 season.</P>
      <P>The group has been keeping staff in both organisations regularly briefed in relation to its work and has also invited submissions from relevant staff and industry interests. The intention is that the group, which has already met on four occasions and is making steady progress in its continuing deliberations, will report back to me within the next month or so.</P>

    <P>Growth in overall tourism numbers over the past ten years has been unprecedented, with visitor numbers doubling to more than six million and foreign exchange earnings tripling to £2.5 billion. I recognise that, while all regions have shared in this growth, there have been some significant variations in performance. The Deputy will be well aware of my personal commitment to facilitating a more balanced regional spread of tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that, last January, I formally launched the tourism product development scheme, which is provided for in the national development plan and has been designed specifically to improve the spatial spread of tourism. The scheme has a particular focus on less-developed areas and makes provision for public sector investment of &euro;130 million in the next five years to help such areas realise their potential and to stimulate new tourism growth areas. Successful realisation of that strategy will be strongly influenced by the delivery by relevant local and other authorities of the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls.</P>
    <P>In addition, comprehensive marketing plans for 2002 recently announced by Tourism Ireland Limited, TIL, and Bord Fáilte also include among their objectives regional development and target a broad mix of tourists of varying age, interest and market origins.</P>
    <P>The successful marketing of Ireland abroad plays a key role in encouraging a wide dispersal of visitors throughout the country and throughout the year so that the benefits of tourism can be more evenly spread. TIL's programme budget of &euro;27 million for 2002 for the international marketing of the island of Ireland is the largest ever annual budget allocated for such a purpose. It is supplemented by substantial niche/product marketing funding by Bord Fáilte which was further enhanced by the allocation of an additional &euro;11 million for tourism marketing to the board by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the recent budget. I understand that Bord Fáilte is aiming more than half that additional money specifically at expanding regional tourism.</P>
    <P>In 2002, Bord Fáilte will implement an intensive marketing campaign in the home market and Northern Ireland providing promotional platforms for the industry. The campaign, which has a budget of &euro;2.1 million, will be particularly strong from February to May and September to November to encourage seasonal and regional extension. It comprises a new advertising campaign, tactical advertising with special offers, complementary publicity and public relations promotions, direct marketing and the distribution of more than 500,000 Discover Ireland brochures enhanced by the use of the recently introduced Discover Ireland website.</P>
    <P>While visitor numbers are important, a more accurate picture of tourism performance is portrayed by revenue. For the period 1997 to 2000, total revenue, which includes overseas visitor revenue and domestic tourism revenue, increased by 32%. The level of total revenue growth for five of the regions only varied by 6%, but there was a 30% difference between the highest growth &ndash; Dublin &ndash; and the lowest &ndash; the north-west.</P>

The membership reflects the different perspectives in the field of drug misuse and has been drawn from the statutory, community, voluntary, academic and research sectors, together with senior level representation from the relevant Departments. Full details of the membership are included in the appendix, which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The main findings of the first report of the national advisory committee on drugs, entitled, Drug Use Prevention: An Overview of Research, which was published in early December 2001, was that there is no single drug problem with one dramatic solution. Rather, what is called the drug problem is comprised of varying degrees of involvement with a variety of substances arising from several influences, many of which are unrelated to each other. The committee's report calls for both targeted and broadly-based programmes to tackle this situation.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that these programmes should focus both on the most damaging forms of misuse, for which social and economic deprivation is seen as a pre-disposing factor, and experimental drug use which is not uncommon to young people from all social backgrounds. In addition, the report recognises the importance of programmes that emphasise personal and social development and welcomes developments in the social, personal and health education programme, SPHE, in schools.</P>
      <P>Many of the recommendations in the report are in line with those in the National Drugs Strategy, 2001-2008, which I launched in May of last year. In this context, it is worth noting that the SPHE programme is being increasingly delivered throughout the second level school system and the strategy aims to have the programme in all such schools by September 2003, with schools in local drugs task force areas being prioritised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Deputy may be aware that one of the key actions in the national drugs strategy is that an ongoing national awareness campaign <Col N="434" /> highlighting the dangers of drug misuse be developed. The health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children formed a working group in 2001 to develop this campaign and its work is well under way. It is studying the NACD report closely and will be taking on board its recommendations. It is planned to launch the first phase of the campaign by mid-2002.</P>
    <P>The NACD report also recommends that targeted initiatives to tackle the social origins of drugs problems should be comprehensive and involve inter-agency co-operation and the community. As the Deputy will be aware, inter-agency co-operation has been an integral part of initiatives in Ireland aimed at tackling the drugs problem in recent years. In addition, the community and voluntary sectors play an important role, not only in interventions to deal with problem drug use such as the local drugs task forces, but also in the work of area partnerships and the RAPID programme. In addition, the regional drugs task forces, which will be in place later in the year, will also have representation from the community and voluntary sectors as well as all the relevant statutory bodies.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to set out the substantial improvements in the provision of top class sporting and recreational facilities throughout the country since the Government took office.

      <P>In relation to swimming, I have increased the total annual allocation of &euro;3.8 million provided by the previous Government to &euro;19 million per year to help provide new and refurbished local swimming pools throughout the country. The new 50 metre pool has already opened in Limerick and the new aquatic centre, and the pool at Abbotstown will be completed by the end of this year and will be used for the World Special Olympic Games in 2003.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I have allocated more than &euro;134.6 million to 2,044 sports and recreational projects in towns and villages throughout Ireland. This investment is helping to provide major regional athletics tracks such as in Cork, Sligo, Navan, Galway, Castleisland and Ringsend as well as the state-of-the-art new indoor athletics facility planned for Morton Stadium, Santry.</P>
      <P>In all, I have allocated sports capital grants amounting to more than &euro;10.1 million to 50 athletics projects in the last three years alone, and the standards and specifications of facilities meet the appropriate relevant requirements of international sports federations.</P>

      <P>As regards formal meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, I have had five in the tourism sectoral format with Mr. Empey, in addition to meeting him and Michael McGimpsey, MLA, Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, my counterpart on the Northern Ireland Executive with responsibility for sport, at three plenary meetings.</P>
      <P>The inaugural meeting of the NSMC in tourism sectoral format took place on 27 October 2000 in Belfast. Items discussed included the memorandum and articles of association for the proposed North-South tourism marketing company, Tourism Ireland Limited, the schedule for setting up the company, arrangements for recruiting a chief executive officer, funding arrangements, the composition of the board and the responsibilities of the company's regional office at Coleraine.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the foundations for achieving a more integrated and streamlined approach to local development initiatives were set out in the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development. Since its approval by Government, work has been proceeding on its implementation, including the appointment of directors of community and enterprise, the establishment of city-county development boards and the preparation of new economic, social and cultural strategies.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the city-county development boards, all area partnership companies and community groups have been participating fully in the workings of the boards. Their strategic plans must demonstrate evidence of linkage and co-ordination within the framework of city-county development boards. Funding of these groups in respect of these plans, which is administered by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, is conditional on the plans having been agreed with the director of community and enterprise of the appropriate city-county development board.</P>
      <P>Funding for these plans will run up until the mid-term review of the national development plan in 2003 and, in the meantime, delivery methods for social inclusion measures at local level, including the role of area based partnerships, will be examined within the context of the economic, social and cultural strategies of the city-county development boards. The boards are mandated to bring about a more integrated approach to the delivery of public and local development services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The National Drugs Strategy, 2001-2008, aims to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way ever undertaken in this country. The strategy contains 100 individual actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
      <P>Since it was launched in May 2001, considerable progress has been made by Departments and agencies to meet the targets which have been set out for them in the strategy. The interdepartmental group on drugs, IDG, which I chair, meets monthly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set for them and any obstacle to the implementation of any of the actions can be brought to light at these meetings. A progress report on the implementation of the strategy is presented to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion every six months. The first of these reports was presented at the January meeting of the Cabinet committee and highlighted a number of areas where substantial progress has been made.</P>
      <P>First, the Department of Education and Science is now represented on nearly all local drugs task forces. In addition, it is recruiting two support staff to enable the delivery of substance misuse prevention programmes in all schools over the next three years. Schools in the local drugs task force areas will be prioritised in this context.</P>
      <P>Second, the Department of Health and Children has established a cross-sectoral committee to develop an ongoing national awareness campaign which was recommended in the strategy. The committee's work is proceeding and it is planned to launch the first phase of the campaign in April. In this context, the committee will also be taking on board the recommendations of the first report of the national advisory committee on drugs, Drug Misuse Prevention: An Overview of Research, which was published in early December 2001.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been also been made regarding increasing the number of methadone treatment places. The number of treatment places at the end of 2001 stood at 5,865, an increase of more than 830 since the start of 2001. Under the national drugs strategy we are committed to increasing that number to 6,500 by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>One of the actions that the strategy recommends is the establishment of regional drugs task forces, which will be set up in every health board area, including the three area health boards that comprise the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The new task forces will bring together the relevant statutory, voluntary and community sectors and the secretariat will be provided by the relevant health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national drugs strategy team is preparing guidelines for the operation of the regional drugs task forces which have been disseminated to the various sectors and agencies for comments. Once the guidelines are finalised, nominations will then be sought and it is planned to have the first meet<Col N="442" /> ings of the regional drugs task forces in May. Representatives of the area based partnerships will be invited to sit on the regional drugs task forces, and I expect them to play an important part in their ongoing work.</P>
    <P>In addition, all Departments and agencies are required to prepare critical implementation paths which set out the steps they propose to take to ensure that the actions set for them in the strategy are met. These implementation paths, which it is hoped to finalise in the coming weeks, will then be published and will assist in monitoring the progress being made by the Departments and agencies involved in the ongoing implementation of the strategy.</P>

    <P>1. The fifth meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in the Tourism sec<Col N="443" /> toral format was held in the Manor House Hotel, Killadeas, County Fermanagh on Friday 22 February 2002. Sir Reg Empey, MLA, Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, who chaired the meeting, and Ms Bairbre de Brún, MLA, Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety represented the Northern Ireland Administration. Dr. James McDaid, T.D., Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, represented the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Progress Report by Chairperson of Tourism Ireland Ltd.</P>
    <P>2. The Chairperson of Tourism Ireland Limited, the North/South tourism marketing company, Mr. Andrew Coppel, presented a progress report on developments since the last meeting of the Council in this sector on 7 November 2001. This report covered:</P>
    <P>Launch of Tourism Ireland</P>
    <P>Corporate Plan 2002 to 2004 and the 2002 Operating Plan</P>
    <P>Operations (Staffing and Premises)</P>
    <P>Development of marketing campaigns; and</P>
    <P>The Tourism Marketing Partnership</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>3. The Chairperson told the meeting that, in addition to the launch of the 2002 marketing programme in Dublin and Belfast on 7 November 2001, further launches took place in London, New York and Toronto and that further launches are planned for Germany and France.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>4. Mr. Coppel reported on progress in relation to the Company's new premises in Dublin and Coleraine. It is hoped that Tourism Ireland will occupy its new headquarters premises in Bishop's Square in Dublin by June 2002 and that the Coleraine office will be occupied by October 2002.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>5. The Chairperson also reported that Tourism Ireland had formally taken over responsibility for the international marketing of the island of Ireland in January 2002 and that marketing campaigns are underway in each market in line with the objectives and strategy approved by the NSMC in November 2001. Mr. Coppel also informed the Council that the Company intends to expand its Tourism Marketing Partnership to include a broader participation by industry in Northern Ireland and in the South and by industry overseas. Market Industry Consultative Groups are also to be formally established in each main market. The main outputs from these groups will be made available to the Tourism Marketing Partnership.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" />6. The Chairperson commented on the Marketing Campaign which had been crafted in a focused manner. However, in the context of the aftermath of 11th September, which has impacted US travel, and the difficult economies in Western Europe, particularly Germany, any forecasts should be treated with caution until there is real evidence of a material recovery in international travel.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>7. The Council welcomed Mr. Coppel's report and commended the progress made since November. Both sides acknowledged the importance to the company of developing close links with industry representatives and expressed satisfaction at the progress that had been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Business Planning</P>
    <P>8. The Chief Executive of Tourism Ireland Ltd., Mr. Paul O'Toole, gave the Council a formal presentation on the Company's Corporate Plan for 2002-2004 and on its Operating Plan for 2002. The NSMC approved both Plans.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>9. In the Corporate Plan, Tourism Ireland is seen as having two key roles. The first is reaching out to consumers in the international marketplace. The second is encouraging business linkages between the tourist industry and the travel trade in target markets. The underlying objective is increasing visitor numbers and revenue to the island of Ireland and to support Northern Ireland in realising its full tourism potential. The Plan anticipates 5% compound growth in tourism to the island with 8% compound growth for Northern Ireland for each of the three years 2002-2004.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>10. The Corporate Plan outlines a challenging plan of action and a set of key tasks that will help the island's tourism industry grow and develop for the long term while also underpinning the development of Tourism Ireland itself. Tourism Ireland will adopt its strategic leadership role for international marketing and will influence the direction of the sector through understanding and communicating its knowledge of Ireland's visitors and markets to its partners.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>11. The 2002 Operating Plan, involving a marketing programme budget of approximately &euro;27m (£16.5m), has been devised to ensure that Tourism Ireland delivers on its mandate to grow tourism as an economic sector on the island of Ireland and in the process, support Northern Ireland to realize its tourism potential. A major component of this year's operating plan is to develop better performance measures for the tourism sector and the company. In addition, the company will continue to develop its relationships with key <Col N="445" /> tourism stakeholders including the industry, North, South and overseas.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>12. The Operating Plan has been prepared in the knowledge that 2002 will be a challenging year. The challenges the Company face reflect the difficult trading conditions that are expected and its need to quickly establish its credentials with stakeholders. Consequently Tourism Ireland's efforts will be focused on three main areas of activity:</P>
    <P>Securing business through implementing ambitious innovative marketing programmes in the new &ldquo;visland of Ireland&rdquo; context</P>
    <P>Establishing the necessary marketing capabilities and communications infrastructure to take the company forward in a new and dynamic environment</P>
    <P>Building and motivating a team of tourism professionals to work with industry partners.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>13. The Council approved both the Corporate Plan and the company's proposed marketing activities in year 2002. The Ministers acknowledged the challenging nature of the targets set out therein and expressed their confidence in the ability of the new Company to meet these targets over the life of the plans. The Council reiterated its wish to see Tourism Ireland play a leading role in the development of the Tourism industry on the island, and restated the importance of the industry to economic growth, North and South.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Date of Next Meeting</P>
    <P>14. The Council agreed that its next meeting in this sectoral format would take place in the South in May 2002.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001 with a closing date of 4 January 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. A total of 1,355 applications were received before the closing date requesting a total of &euro;310.8 million in funding.</P>
      <P>Applications are being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. Following the assessment process, recommendations will be made to me as to which applications should be funded and to what extent. A decision will then be made on the amount of funding to be allocated under the programme and I will announce the grants to be allocated as soon as possible after this process has been completed. Since I became Minister with responsibility for sport, I have to date allocated more than &euro;134.6 million in funding under sports capital programmes in the 1998 to 2001 period in comparison with a total of &euro;24.6 million allocated by the previous Government in the 1995 to 1997 period.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="447" />Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 32 and 45 together.</P>
    <P>I refute any suggestions of discrimination by the Irish Sports Council, ISC or that &ldquo;democratic principles were not followed in a fair manner&rdquo;. The council is a statutory body and, therefore, is fully accountable for all its actions. It is required by section 8 of the Irish Sports Council Act, l999, to establish criteria, terms and conditions relating to the provision of assistance.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the council that all funding whether to national governing bodies, NGBs, or to athletes, is provided only where the NGB has already been recognised by the council. In this respect, the council published criteria for the recognition of national governing bodies of sport in April 2001. At this time all non-recognised NGBs who had been in contact with the council were given the opportunity to apply for recognition, including five winter sports bodies; the Irish Bobsleigh Association, the Dublin Ice Skating Club, the Irish Ice Hockey Association, the Irish Curling Association and the Ski Association of Ireland. No applications have been received from any of these organisations to date. In November 2001, the council wrote again to the Irish Bobsleigh Association, the Irish Ice Hockey Association and the Ski Association of Ireland asking if they wished to meet with the ISC to discuss recognition criteria and the status of their organisation. Only the Ice Hockey Association has responded to date and a meeting was held with this organisation on 20 February 2002.</P>
    <P>Given that none of the winter sport organisations has been recognised for ISC funding purposes to date, this means that the council also has no mechanism through which to support the individual athletes, as funding under the carding scheme is made available on the basis of agreed criteria with recognised NGBs. In any event, no applications were received from individual winter sports organisations or individual winter sports athletes for funding to prepare for or to participate in the Salt Lake City Games.</P>
    <P>The council also informed me that the Olympic Council of Ireland, OCI, requested funding totalling approximately &euro;78,700 for pre-Olympic training and the medical programme for the 2002 Winter Games as part of its grant application in January 2000. The council requested the OCI to submit more detailed information regarding its preparation programme, the qualification process and the number of athletes involved. No correspondence was received from the OCI on this issue for the remainder of 2000.</P>
    <P>The Olympic Council of Ireland submitted its 2001 grant application to the Irish Sports Council in July 2001 but did not apply for funding in respect of any aspect of the Salt Lake City Winter Games. In September 2001, the issue of funding was raised at a meeting between the OCI and the council in connection with bobsleigh and skiing teams preparing for the Winter Games in 2002. <Col N="448" /> However, as none of the winter sports organisations had applied for recognition, no funding could be provided without first gaining recognition.</P>
    <P>The ISC has informed me that it has suggested on a number of occasions to the winter sports to come together to form a winter sports federation to act as a representative body for all the different disciplines. The council is not aware of any progress in this regard.</P>

      <QRef>[8035/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): Under the framework of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, published in November 1999, a number of indicators and targets have been set for tourism performance over the life of the plan. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism were targeted to grow at an annual average rate of 5% while a reduction of two percentage points was targeted over the seven year period in the number of visitors arriving during the peak July-August period. In addition, an increase of three percentage points in the proportion of total out-of-State tourism revenue accruing to the Border, midland and western region was targeted over the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>For the year 2000, the first full year of the NDP, foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased by approximately 15%  &ndash; well ahead of target &ndash; while there was a reduction of one percentage point in the number of visitors arriving during the peak July-August period. Progress against the regional target was also satisfactory with a gain of more than two percentage points in the proportion of tourism revenue accruing to the BMW region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" />While the above outcome is encouraging, caution must be exercised in interpreting the results for a single year in the context of multiannual target setting. Figures for the year 2001 are not yet available. However current Bord Fáilte estimates predict a decline in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland last year but an increase in their expenditure. Final figures should be available from the CSO by mid-year. </P>
    <P>While it is inevitable that the recent unexpected setbacks in tourism will make the task of keeping in line with targets more challenging in the short-term, NDP targets have to be viewed in the context of a seven year timeframe, and I have no plans to review them at this time. A mid-term review of the NDP is due to take place late in 2003.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the transfer of staff from Bord Fáilte to the new cross-Border body, Tourism Ireland Limited, the number of Irish-based and foreign-based staff who have transferred to date; if agreement has been reached regarding terms and working conditions for the staff who are transferring; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8038/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): As I informed the House in reply to a similar question on 30 January 2002, responsibility for the international marketing of Ireland as a tourism destination officially transferred from Bord Fáilte Éireann to Tourism Ireland Limited with effect from 1 January 2002. Bord Fáilte staff due to transfer to Tourism Ireland were involved in the preparatory planning work of the company for some months prior to that, with the active support of the trade unions that represent them. This co-operation from the staff and the trade unions remains ongoing.</P>
    <P>I understand from the company that the present number of staff in Tourism Ireland is 53, of whom 23 are based in Ireland and 30 are overseas. Of the total of 53 staff, 32 have transferred, including 27 from Bord Fáilte, and 21 are new recruits. A further four recruits will result from competitions that are nearing completion. The total number of staff who will be employed by Tourism Ireland in 2002 will be about 150, after all formal transfers take place from Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the staff and their trade unions have been very detailed due to a number of factors, including the complexities of transferring staff in 15 jurisdictions worldwide; the merging of the overseas marketing activities of Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in a number of the principal markets; compliance by Tourism Ireland with local regulations for con<Col N="450" /> ducting business in the various jurisdictions; the application of relevant local employment legislation; and the superannuation provisions for transferred staff and those recruited directly.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the RAPID programme is a focused initiative by the Government to target the 25 most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. Priority attention is given under the programme to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through front-loading State resources, available under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The area implementation plans for 13 of the 25 RAPID areas have been approved by the relevant city-county development boards and have been forwarded to the relevant Departments for consideration by the national co-ordinator for the programme at ADM Limited. As the plans were prepared by local area implementation teams for the individual areas, the range of measures and initiatives vary from area to area as will the level of national development plan funding which these proposals will lever.</P>
      <P>At present, officials in each Department are initiating contacts with local agency personnel to discuss how best to progress the proposals. The area plans for the remaining 12 areas &ndash; eight in the Dublin City Council area and four in the South Dublin County Council area &ndash;  are expected shortly.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for strand two of the RAPID programme which caters for provincial towns, while the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is the lead Department for the CLÁR programme which is targeting rural areas.</P>
      <P>A national monitoring committee has been established to monitor the implementation of both strands of the RAPID programme and the committee recently held its first meeting.</P>

    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): As I have explained previously, in response to similar questions about conference facilities, Bord Fáilte commissioned new research last year on the international conference market and the optimum positioning of Ireland within that market.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report, entitled, Maximising Ireland's Potential in the International Conference Market, has since been referred to other relevant Departments for their considered opinions before reaching any conclusions in the context of future policy on the development of international conference business into Ireland. It is understood that the outcome of their deliberations will be made known to my Department shortly.</P>
    <P>The report was specifically commissioned to facilitate consideration of the broad issue of optimising Ireland's share of the international conference market, of which physical conference infrastructure is but one component.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid): I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 47 and 48 together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" />An evaluation of the latest costings for the stadium and sports campus project is clearly set out in the High-Point Rendel report, which has been circulated to all Deputies and is also available on my Department's website. Based on the proposal for a revised scope of project, in essence, the HPR report estimates the total cost of the stadium, arena and other facilities is broadly similar to those of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited. In addition, the HPR projection provides for a higher contingency amount because of the still evolving nature of the brief; a slightly higher anticipated inflation level and also provides for professional costs and a sinking fund.</P>
    <P>On publication of the High-Point Rendel report, the Government has requested me to report on the implications of the HPR recommendations and options and in particular to evaluate the viability of the existing tendering strategy as a basis for any modification of the stadium design and operation, the implications for the Exchequer of the options and recommendations, and the issues raised in paragraph 1.7 of the report, a copy of which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a process for the consideration of these issues. I will be drawing on a wide area of expertise and advice so that a thorough evaluation of the recommendations is made to ensure that Government is in a position to reach the best and most appropriate decision on the future of Campus-Stadium Ireland.</P>
    <P>Until I have completed this evaluation and reported to Government, it would be premature to make any statement on the future plans for this project or to speculate on the extent of any future expenditure on the project.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX 1</P>
    <P>1.7Our investigations have resulted in a number of issues being critical to the realisation of the concept of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland:</P>
    <P>(i)&nbsp;The procurement strategy, in particular the DBFO strategy currently being pursued by CSID;</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp;the Stadium and Arena and in particular the detailed specification and functionality of these facilities;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;the infrastructure and landscaping of the 500 acre site;</P>

    <P>(v)&nbsp;the rationale for some of the minor facilities e.g. the golfing academy and the velodrome;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(vi)&nbsp;the method of procuring and delivering non-sporting facilities i.e. the HQ offices and Sports Science Centre;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(vii)&nbsp;the agreements with the sporting bodies; in particular usage, operational and commercial arrangements; and</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the young people's facilities and services fund &ndash; YPFSF &ndash; was established in 1998 to support the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The aim of the fund is to attract young people in disadvantaged areas &ndash; at risk of becoming involved in problem drug use &ndash; into more healthy and productive pursuits. To date, over &euro;59 million has been allocated under the YPFSF.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 23 January, the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion approved, in principle, the arrangements for a second round of funding under the YPFSF. As a result, the development groups in the local drugs task force areas who are charged with developing local integrated plans for each of the areas have been asked to submit proposals for facilities projects by 17 May 2002. Proposals in relation to services projects will be sought later in the year.</P>
      <P>Once the proposals for capital projects have been evaluated by the national assessment committee, they will be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion for consideration and approval. It is not possible to say at this time when announcements on projects to be grant aided under the new round of funding will be made.</P>

    <P>Since September 2000, CSID has paid &euro;2.285 million, £1.8 million, in respect of executive services.

      <P>The provision of support to industrial projects is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, would have a direct function. The relevant agencies are IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the financing of capital infrastructure projects and, in that context, it is important to point out that the agencies' policy in recent years has been to move away from capacity building supports, such as capital grants, towards supports targeted on improving specific business functions such as research and development and skills enhancement.</P>
      <P>The following information has been supplied by the agencies under the aegis of my Department &ndash; IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and Shannon Development &ndash; regarding capital expenditure on infrastructure under the various relevant operational programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland, the agency under the aegis of my Department charged with the attraction of overseas industry to Ireland, has committed itself to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Objective One regions in the coming years. IDA Ireland's capital infrastructural projects are related to the provision and maintenance of the industrial property portfolio throughout the country.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 55, 58 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for insurance companies themselves. EU law prevents me from intervening in the pricing or underwriting of insurance.</P>
      <P>I am aware that motor insurance premiums for young drivers are high and that premiums generally have increased in 2001 and 2002. Insurers have attributed these increases to the high cost of settling claims in Ireland, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions that necessitate increased claims reserves and costs to reinsurers of the events of 11 September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" />With regard to motor insurance, the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, is in the process of completing its work, which included an examination of the cost of motor insurance for young drivers. I expect to receive the final report of the board this month. I will examine the board's recommendations as a matter of urgency when received with the intention of bringing proposals to Government thereafter.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. I am confident that the establishment of the PIAB will achieve a reduction in the delivery cost of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>

I have no plans to change the current eligibility criteria for the programme at this time. My Department will, however, continue to keep the future operation of CE under review with reference to its primary role as an active labour market programme to assist participants to progress into jobs and-or further education and training. In this regard, as provided for under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, an overall review of active labour market programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the near future under the aegis of the PPF standing committee on the labour market. The future policy direction of CE will be informed by the outcome of this process.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which was published in June 1996, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. This recommendation was to be implemented by the newspaper industry itself.</P>
      <P>The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of the ombudsman proposal to changes in the law on defamation, and in that respect the Government approved a general scheme of a defamation Bill on 18 December, 2001. I understand that the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government has been asked to arrange for formal drafting of a Bill based on that scheme.</P>
      <P>I trust that the commitment of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce new defamation legislation will enable the newspaper industry to proceed to the establishment of a press ombudsman.</P>

      <P>An application from the company (details supplied) was received on 11 January 2002.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Department to process applications for work permits strictly in the order in which they are received. Assuming that the applications are completed correctly and are otherwise in order, processing time will take approximately 51 working days from the date of receipt of the applications.</P>
      <P>The processing time for work permit applications has risen due to the unprecedented number of applications received in the Department, especially in November and December 2001. The number of work permit applications increased from an average of over 350 per week in 2000 to more than 825 per week last year. The level of applications climbed during the year and in December alone, an unprecedented 5,690 applications were received. New procedures were introduced with effect from 2 January 2002 and these have resulted, at least temporarily, in a reduction in the number of applications received.</P>
      <P>While staff numbers in the work permit section were increased by 50% last year in an effort to reduce processing time, the very large increase in applications meant that the waiting period could not be reduced. Nevertheless, the staff in the section issued 36,436 permits in 2001, compared with some 18,000 in the year 2000.</P>

      <Quest> if she will increase the number of persons in various age groups, particularly the over-50s, allowed to continue on social employment schemes after two years have elapsed. </Quest>

      <P>Participation on community employment is normally for a period of one to a maximum of three years as the primary objective of the programme is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. In August, 2001 I announced new flexibility arrangements for the future operation of CE which allows FÁS discretion to extend, on a case by case basis, an individual's term on CE, having regard to that individual's personal development needs and future employment prospects. I have no plans to increase the numbers remaining on the <Col N="465" /> programme for extended periods beyond the new flexibility already introduced.</P>
      <P>In the case of people aged over 50 years, the three year cap on participation has been removed where people in this age group, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment. For such participants FÁS now has discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case-by-case basis. In addition, FÁS now has the flexibility to offer a further period of participation of up to one year for a limited number of those in the younger age groups who are also experiencing difficulty in obtaining employment. This flexibility will apply in those cases where it is clear that an extension would be of benefit to the participants in terms of improving their prospects of progressing to a job in the open labour market. In general, approximately 20% of participants on CE may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the new flexibility guidelines.</P>

      <P>Last December I made the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) (Amendment) Regulations, 2001. This legislation provides for the continued licensing until the end of this year of a number of petrol stations which had been in use before 1979.</P>
      <P>Proposals to update the existing legislation have been developed by the Health and Safety Authority in consultation with the retail petrol industry. The proposed primary legislation will address the licensing of kerbside petrol stations on an individual risk assessment basis taking into account site management controls, quantities dispensed and location. It is my intention to bring forward during the year the necessary primary legislation to update the existing licensing regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties being experienced by young people in obtaining motor insurance. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me and the Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>In relation to young persons being unable to obtain motor insurance, the declined cases agreement between my Department and the authorised motor insurance companies offers the provision of a quotation subject to, <i>inter alia</i>, written evidence of five refusals of cover from motor insurers.</P>
      <P>Under the Equal Status Act, 2000, any individual who considers that he or she has experienced discrimination within the meaning of the Act may refer a complaint to the Director of Equality Investigations for investigation or mediation. Among the areas of potential discrimination are the age or sex of an individual.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, is in the process of completing its work, which includes an examination of the cost of motor insurance for young drivers. I expect to receive the final report of the board this month. I will examine the board's recommendations as a matter of urgency when received, with the intention of bringing proposals to Government thereafter.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the financing of capital infrastructure projects and, in that context, it is important to point out that the agencies' policy in recent years has been to move away from capacity building supports, such as capital grants, towards supports targeted on improving specific business functions such as research and development and skills enhancement.</P>
      <P>The following information has been supplied by the agencies regarding funding for job creation between 1995-2001.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to ascertain from the official figures how much, if any, of the increases in prices during this three month period could be attributable to the introduction of the euro. This is not unique to this country. However, the figures clearly do not support suggestions that there were widespread, or excessive increases in prices during the period of the changeover to the euro, or because of its introduction. There is no other evidence available to my Department to suggest that businesses took particular advantage of the introduction of the euro to increase prices.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs received 293 complaints about price increases during the first week of the changeover to the euro. By the middle of February complaints to the director's office about price increases had fallen to about 17 per week. My Department has <Col N="473" /> received about 40 complaints about price rises associated with the introduction of the euro.</P>
    <P>Price control as a policy mechanism has not been pursued by any Government since the 1980s. Successive Governments since then have recognised that the encouragement of a competitive environment and promotion of greater price awareness is a far better way of ensuring value for money for consumers than the imposition of price controls. In the absence of active price control, movements relating to prices of goods and services are an ongoing aspect of the market economy.</P>

      <P>The relative position of regions, in terms of variables such as GDP per head and employment, is a very significant determinant of policy, both at EU and national level. These factors determine the focus of policy on matters such as EU Structural Funds and State aid to enterprise. For example, the maximum approved rate of grants to support new investment in manufacturing and internationally traded service industry in the period 2000 to 2006 for large firms is 40% in the Border, midland and western region and 17.5% in Dublin. The rate in the other four regions in Ireland is around 30% and will be around 20% for the period 2004 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Regional emphasis is a strong feature of the various programmes adopted under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 and carried out through the Structural Fund operational programmes for that period. It is underpinned by the strong regional emphasis in the work of agencies such as IDA and Enterprise Ireland. The IDA is committed to delivering half of all new greenfield jobs into the Border, midland and western region in the coming years, a target which was achieved in the year 2000. Both agencies have re-focused their resources on regions outside Dublin, and particular account is taken of the needs of the BMW area in matters such as transport, roads and telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Employment in the client firms of the industrial development agencies &ndash; the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, and Údarás na Gaeltachta &ndash; increased by just under 50% in the ten years 1992 to 2001, and by just under 30% in the five years 1997 to 2001. While employment growth was stronger in the Dublin and mid-east regions, employment growth was achieved in all regions. In County Leitrim, the increase for the five years 1997 to 2001 was just under 40%.</P>
      <P>Regional development will continue to be a strong focus of policy. This will be facilitated by the development of the national spatial strategy which is under way at present. Regional impact will also be one of the main factors to be considered in the mid-term review of the operational programmes for 2000 to 2006, to be carried out in 2003.</P>

      <P>The provision of workspace in particular areas of the country is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies and is not one in which I have a direct <Col N="475" /> function. However, I understand that IDA Ireland has overall responsibility for the provision of advanced buildings in County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Leitrim is a priority area for IDA Ireland and the agency will continue to market the location for new inward investment. In recent years the county has seen major new investment from overseas companies such Masonite, MBNA and Eaton Automotive. The IDA is in the process of developing a new advance facility in Carrick-on-Shannon, and this building will be used to assist in the marketing of the location.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is involved in the Leitrim County Development Board, which involves the development of a seven year plan for the county. The plan is nearing completion and will cover all aspects of development within the county. The plan will highlight a number of issues, including infrastructure, that are preventing Leitrim from achieving its development potential. The plan will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Significant efforts are being made to enhance infrastructure in the county. IDA Ireland will continue to work with Leitrim County Council and others to ensure that the county is well placed to secure new inward investment in the future.</P>
      <P>Land in the ownership of the IDA in Ballinamore is in the process of being sold to the local Ballinamore development company with support from Enterprise Ireland. The land will be developed to support the construction of an enterprise centre and buildings. The IDA also has land available in Mohill, Drumshanbo and Manorhamilton and is prepared to sell it if required for development purposes. The IDA has no requests at present from prospective purchasers. However, the IDA is in preliminary discussion with Leitrim County Council regarding the possibility of the council acquiring land from the IDA for the purpose of future workspace-enterprise development.</P>
      <P>The role of Enterprise Ireland relates to the provision of support for the expansions of existing companies and working closely with communities to create enterprise space. Between 1997 and 2001 Enterprise Ireland has been involved in facilitating the following enterprise space developments:</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>Drumshanbo</i>The community enterprise centre which Enterprise Ireland helped fund in 1993, &euro;60,947.43, provided start-up space for a call centre that provided employment in Drumshanbo for in excess of 20 people. The company, the Orthopaedic Bed Company, moved to Carrick-on-Shannon last year to a larger premises but has expressed an interest in setting up a new venture in Drumshanbo. Nothing has been confirmed to date. This facility is also widely used as a training facility.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mohill</i>Enterprise Ireland approved approximately &euro;114,000 in 1996 to a community group in Mohill to construct a new enterprise centre. A 6,500 sq. ft. enterprise centre was opened in 1999 in Mohill and this is of significant value to the local community both in terms of enterprise space and also as a training facility with many locals being trained in IT skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" />
      <i>Ballinamore</i>Enterprise Ireland funded &euro;59,394.54 towards the costs associated with the creation of a 2,400 sq. ft. community centre in 1994. This centre is completed and is fully occupied.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Manorhamilton</i>Cluainin Community Development Association Limited: Enterprise Ireland investment of approximately &euro;127,000 approved for a 7,000 sq. ft. community enterprise centre in Manorhamilton in 1998. A number of businesses have already commenced operating from this centre.</P>
    <P>On a broader level Enterprise Ireland has run campaigns over the past three Christmas periods to try to attract potential entrepreneurs back to the north-west region, including County Leitrim, and in particular Drumshanbo, Mohill and Ballinamore. To date, no enquiries have resulted in start-ups in these areas.</P>
    <P>Leitrim County Enterprise Board has taken a role in the following efforts to provide additional workspace in the county.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Drumshanbo:</i>Funded the development of a new business and child care centre in Drumshanbo; working with community council to secure tenants for existing workspace; application received to assist an extension at Drumshanbo enterprise centre.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ballinamore:</i>Provided a feasibility study grant to Ballinamore development company (December 2001) to investigate feasibility of enterprise-industrial units at Willowfield, Ballinamore, and develop business plan for same; provided a feasibility study grant to a private individual in December 2001 to investigate the feasibility of a major social and educational facility in Ballinamore.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Mohill:</i>No plans for additional workspace at current time; working with private contractor to develop enterprise units at Carrigallen, County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Manorhamilton:</i>Also provided capital grant aid of £50,000 (&euro;63,500) to Cluainin Community Development Company Limited towards the development of enterprise and technology centre in Manorhamilton.</P>

      <P>Motor insurance schemes whereby parties signing up to them avail of the bulk purchase of insurance cover and the consequential savings are an established feature of the insurance market. A critical aspect of such schemes is the fact that the association or organisation in question is able to validate the bona fides of their members seeking the cover. This is an assurance to the underwriter that the member being assessed for cover, for example a taxi or hackney driver, is operating within specified guidelines and requirements and therefore represents a risk improvement to the underwriter. Such arrangements are commonly negotiated by associations and organisations across all professions and industries. I would see such schemes as being of benefit to all members of associations and organisations whether these members be long-term or new members.</P>

      <P>I have meetings on an ongoing basis with salmon fishermen, both commercial fishermen and recreational anglers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the latest available management and scientific information, meaningful reductions in salmon catches involving all sectors must be delivered starting this year. A key action to achieve this objective is the introduc<Col N="479" /> tion of fishery district quotas for the taking of salmon by commercial fishing engines, including driftnets. I have clearly stated that I am committed to a sustainable commercial salmon fishery based on quality and value rather than volume. Accordingly, the introduction of quotas will not be accompanied by compensation. I have ruled out buy-out of commercial fishing licences as it is clear that this option is most attractive to those who take few salmon. However, I will continue to support, subject to available Exchequer funding, local catchment-based set-aside proposals with matching funding. In other words, the only context for incentivisation schemes will be through an agreed local scheme involving commercial fishermen and all other stakeholders who stand to benefit from increased spawning escapement.</P>

      <P>While not formally published, the joint agency review was made widely available by the agencies after its finalisation. At the first meeting of the representative and independently chaired Sea Trout Review Group, STRG, on 30 May 2001, my Department specifically asked the group to have regard to the findings of the agencies' review. My Department and the agencies will continue to make available copies of the report to any person or group who requests it. I am looking forward in addition to receiving the final report of the STRG which I understand is at a final stage of completion.</P>

    <P>I am committed to ensuring that the Irish salmon farming sector operates to the highest environmental and husbandry methods. I am equally committed to securing the future of sea trout stocks through forward-looking sea trout rehabilitation management, conservation and research strategies. I have already informed the House of a significant enhancement of the sea lice management regime on salmon farms, in particular the introduction of sea lice and fallowing protocols which I introduced in May 2000. Aquaculture development sustainably and responsibly <Col N="480" /> managed can live in harmony with wild fisheries and with all users of the marine resource.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 87, 89 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Inshore vessels which target selected species such as lobster have the potential to seriously impact on stocks around the coast. In this situation, I have given priority to the development of new management arrangements for Irish inshore fishing vessels operating in inshore waters to ensure that inshore stocks are managed and developed on a sustainable basis. A recent survey of the inshore sector carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, found that some of the traditional inshore fleet remain outside the licensing and registration framework. I therefore introduced a new scheme which will give bona fide fishermen an opportunity to fully regularise their situation and become full participants before the introduction of the new management arrangement for inshore stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While early indications are that there is strong interest in the new scheme, fishermen have until 28 March 2002 to submit applications. BIM has held a series of information and consultation meetings throughout the coastal communities in relation to the scheme. Reservations to the scheme were expressed at these meetings, princi<Col N="482" /> pally on the grounds of affordability. Having reviewed the legitimate concerns that have been expressed, I announced on 5 March that I would be seeking the approval of the European Commission for proposed amendments to the scheme that would provide that vessel owners will only be required to provide 50% replacement capacity in respect of their vessel in the context of the creation of a new inshore segment in the fishing fleet. In pursuing this approach with the Commission, I will ensure that the present position of the significant majority of vessel owners in the inshore sector who are licensed and registered will not be affected. Pending receipt of Commission approval, the 5 July deadline for receipt of supporting documents and providing one-third replacement capacity is to be deferred. No provisional licences will issue pending Commission approval. The closing date for receipt of applications under the scheme remains 28 March. In introducing these amendments, I am responding positively to concerns raised, while retaining the objective of having all vessels registered and licensed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the scheme for the licensing of inshore fishing vessels which I recently announced. The overall position is that fishermen who are not engaged in fishing on a commercial basis are not required to have a sea fishing boat licence or keep a log book or, in the case of fish caught on shore, a shellfish gatherer's document. Such fishermen are not, therefore, required to be licensed under the inshore scheme and hence do not have to provide replacement tonnage. My Department's sea fishery officers are engaged in the enforcement of legal requirements relating to commercial sea fishing activities.</P>

The launch received wide media coverage in both the national and local press and radio and television. Details regarding the objectives of the scheme and how to apply were advertised by BIM in <i>The Kerryman</i> and <i>Connaught Tribune</i> of 19 January 2001 and the <i>Southern Star</i> of 20 January 2001. Details were also published in BIM's Aquaculture Newsletter No. 36 and Aquaculture Ireland.</P>
      <P>Administration of the scheme was a day to day matter for BIM which dealt with all matters such as publicity, the application process and the assessment of applications received in accordance with agreed criteria. I have asked the board to reply to the Deputy directly in regard to all the matters raised.</P>

      <P>Under the Fisheries Acts, the day-to-day management of the eel fishery, including the issue of eel fishing licences, is a matter for the regional fisheries boards. The ESB, in exercise of its powers under the Shannon Fisheries Acts, operates an ongoing eel management programme on the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the ESB published a report prepared by the National University of Ireland, Galway, entitled Eel Fishing in the River Shannon: Eel Population Changes, Fishery Management Options and Fishery Conservation Issues, which reviewed the research and development work undertaken during the ESB Shannon eel management programme between the years 1992 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The ESB report is one of a number of documents published in recent years which provide a background of research and management proposals relating to the eel resource. At present, my Department is reviewing the way forward for the future development and regulation of the eel resource and, in that context, the question of establishing an eel fishery review group will be addressed.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, a new investment programme for inland fisheries is being drawn up which will provide new funding opportunities for inland fisheries development projects. A total of £24 million in 1999 prices is available for recreational and tourism angling in the regions. Of this total, an amount of £17 million is allocated to the Border, midlands and western region and £7 million to the southern and eastern region. Expressed in euro and adjusted to current prices, the overall financial envelope is &euro;38 million. When the elements of the angling measures of the regional operational programmes are in place, I intend that they will be widely publicised. The allocations under the regional operational programmes are not allocated to particular fisheries regions. However, the regional fisheries boards will be submitting projects for funding. This investment programme is additional to current <Col N="487" /> Exchequer funding for the inland fisheries service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 116 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>The Government of Algeria continues to oppose the appointment of a UN special rapporteur and it appears that, as on previous occasions, there would be insufficient support among the current members of the UN Commission for Human Rights for such a proposal to succeed. In such circumstances, it would be counterproductive were a proposal to be made only to be defeated.</P>
      <P>Reports by both the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the special rapporteur on torture are due to be considered at the forthcoming United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. It is expected that these would, <i>inter alia</i>, comment on developments in Algeria. The question of access for special rapporteurs to report at first hand on human rights situations of concern in a number of countries, not only Algeria, will also be an issue in Geneva. The EU will again call on Algeria to give access to these rapporteurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" />Ireland and our EU partners will again refer to the situation in Algeria at Geneva under agenda item 9, which concerns the question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Government will continue to present its view that a more co-operative approach by Algeria to the utilisation of the human rights protection machinery of the United Nations, including the role of special rapporteurs, would be a constructive step in helping to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the current tragic situation and to develop the rule of law and strengthen the democratic process in Algeria.</P>
    <P>When a delegation from the external relations directorate of the European Commission under the EU-sponsored initiative for human rights and democracy recently applied to visit Algeria, a problem arose with the visa applications. I am informed that this was of a technical nature. I understand that the visit has had to be postponed, but that it is expected to go ahead in April. The visit is part of the EU's bilateral activities with Algeria to promote human rights and democracy and is part of the MEDA programme, the principal financial instrument of the EU for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.</P>
    <P>I believe that the human rights dialogue between the EU and Algeria will be enhanced by the recently negotiated EU-Algeria Association Agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. In particular, Article 2 of the agreement states that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will guide the internal and international policies of the parties and will constitute an essential element of the agreement. The agreement also commits Algeria to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. Ireland expects to see these commitments implemented fully in practice.</P>

      <P>The Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, and the National Committee for Development Education, NCDE, are bodies which come under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Both of these bodies have a shared library or resource centre in the office building which they share with the development co-operation division of my Department. The resource centre is operated by APSO and is staffed by its own permanent staff members. There are no vacancies in either of these libraries at the present time.</P>

      <P>Ireland does not have a dual citizenship agreement with any country. There is nothing in Irish legislation to prevent an Irish citizen holding simultaneously citizenship of another country or countries.</P>
      <P>The laws governing citizenship and eligibility for passports of other countries are a matter for determination by those countries. Where a citizen of another country is eligible and applies for Irish citizenship, he or she would need to inquire from the authorities of that country about the effect, if any, such an application would have on their original citizenship. The Irish passport authorities have no difficulty with Irish citizens holding Irish passports as well as passports of their other country or countries of citizenship.</P>

      <P>This case arose from the bombing of an Irish vessel, the <i>mv Loch Ryan</i>, by German war planes off the coast of Cornwall on 16 August 1940 and has involved a claim on behalf of the family of the owners of the vessel for compensation from Germany. The family's case has been raised with the German authorities on a number of occasions since the incident took place, most recently by Ireland's ambassador at Berlin on 28 February 2001.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, despite the best efforts of my Department, the German authorities are adamant that they do not accept liability in this case and, as I indicated to the Deputy in reply to his question on this matter on 9 May last, nor is there any indication that the position of the German authorities on this point will change.</P>
      <P>Moreover, there is no international legal forum before which Germany can be compelled to appear in this case. I fully appreciate that the family of the late owner of the vessel are unhappy with this outcome and it was with much regret therefore that I have had to inform both the family and the Deputy that further pursuit of the claim holds out no prospect of success. Unfortunately that position has not changed. There are no other active claims for damages at the present time.</P>

        <b>
        </b>
        <i>Airports</i>Under the airports measure of the national development plan, a total of &euro;750,122.88 was paid out in 2001 to Galway, Knock and Sligo regional airports in the BMW region. This funding was in respect of safety related projects, such as fire rescue equipment and navigational aids. An amount of &euro;55,138.49 was provided towards similar projects at Waterford Regional Airport in the same period.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>Public Transport</i>Over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 it is envisaged that at least &euro;250 million will be spent in the BMW region under the regional public transport programme and a total of &euro;2.5 billion will be spent in the southern and eastern region. This includes &euro;152 million on railway safety, &euro;57 million on non-safety related railway improvements and almost &euro;40.63 million on bus services in the BMW region. The breakdown for the rest of the country is &euro;575 million for the regional public transport programme and more than &euro;2 billion on public transport measures in the greater Dublin area. Overall, up to beginning of December 2001, almost &euro;100 million has been spent on public transport projects in the BMW region and &euro;650 million has been spent in the rest of the country under the above programme.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the investment are to: (1) upgrade the mainline rail infrastructure, rolling stock and facilities; (2) upgrade the suburban rail and DART network; (3) develop the light rail network; and (4) develop the bus services in Dublin and in the major provincial cities and towns and to develop and improve rural bus services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These combined objectives will be achieved through mainline rail investment in safety and renewal; enhanced suburban rail services through increased capacity on the DART and outer suburban rail services; increased frequency of suburban rail services; introduction of the Luas ser<Col N="493" /> vices in 2003; regional bus improvements &ndash; provincial cities, rural and main routes from and to Dublin; Dublin city bus improvements; ongoing fleet replacement and re-equipment by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath; and accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Telecommunications</i>An ongoing aspect of the work of my Department is to progress the establishment of public-private partnerships on telecommunications infrastructure. My Department has responsibility for the communications and e-commerce measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The objective of the measure is to support the provision of advanced communications and e-commerce infrastructure in less developed areas of Ireland and to improve Ireland's position relative to advanced economies in terms of the information society. A provision of &euro;200 million is available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to support this measure.</P>
    <P>Projects specific to the BMW region are listed below.</P>
    <P>Regional E-commerce Hubs &ndash; this project will develop four regional points of presence in the west  &ndash; Carrick-on-Shannon, Sligo, Castlebar and Galway &ndash; offering a range of services, including web hosting, application services and telephony services. Expenditure in the BMW region to date: &euro;314,237.</P>
    <P>National Fibre Optic Network &ndash; linking major centres nationally. Expenditure in the BMW region to date: &euro;708,033.</P>
    <P>Longford Broadband Infrastructure &ndash; to provide Longford town with a broadband communications infrastructure. Expenditure in the BMW region to date: &euro;100,194.30.</P>
    <P>Projects in the rest of the country are listed below.</P>
    <P>National Fibre Optic Network &ndash; linking major centres nationally. Expenditure in the region to date: &euro;2,644,863.</P>
    <P>South-west Cork Digital Link &ndash; a broadband fibre-optic network from Cork to Clonakilty, providing these areas with access to state of the art telecommunications services. Expenditure in the region to date: &euro;712,058.</P>
    <P>The sum of &euro;76 million has been spent in 2001 and 2002 on property purchase and telecommunications infrastructure for the digital hub and MediaLab Europe projects located in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by Semi-State bodies &ndash; details of expenditure by the semi-State agencies under the aegis of my Department are a matter for the bodies themselves.</P>

Traffic using the crossing passes over a stream beside the railway via a narrow masonry arch bridge. The distance between the parapets of this bridge is similar to the crossing gates.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann informs me that it has obtained the opinion of senior counsel regarding the need for planning permission for works of this nature and he has advised that it is not required. However, Iarnród Éireann has consulted with the roads section of Kildare County Council and with Dúchas, the heritage service, regarding these works and have complied with their requirements.</P>
      <P>I understand from Iarnród Éireann that problems were identified with the strength of the bridge at Caragh. For safety reasons, the company proposes to replace the masonry arch with a new flatspan structure, while retaining the abutments of the present structure and cladding the new span in stone. These works are being funded by the Government under the Iarnród Éireann railway safety programme 1999-2003. Iarnród Éireann has carried out similar safety works on many masonry arch bridges around the country.</P>

      <P>The priority for my Department and for Aer Lingus itself is the urgent implementation <Col N="497" /> of its survival plan which is aimed at restoring the company to viability. While significant progress has been made in relation to the survival plan and a degree of stability has emerged, Aer Lingus is still in a very vulnerable position due to its strained cash position and weak balance sheet. Considerable management action and initiative will be required in 2002 both to fully implement the very significant changes envisaged in the survival plan in the timescale required and also to continue to meet revenue and operating targets. In addition, external investment is necessary to support the future development of the company and the Government decision of 23 October 2001 to facilitate private sector and staff investment in the airline still stands. Considerable progress has been made on the increased staff shareholding in the company and I expect talks to resume on this matter soon.</P>
      <P>However, arrangements to give effect to the private sector investment will not be activated pending resolution of the pilots' dispute. This dispute is the subject of arbitration and facilitation processes as proposed by the Labour Relations Commission, which are expected to be completed shortly.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the board of Knock International Airport had to introduce an ?8 airport charge to persons boarding aircraft to make up the shortfall in revenue in view of the termination of duty free; and if she will provide the amount of funding to the airport that the introduced charge accumulates.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Knock Airport is a privately owned and managed airport and, as such, I have no function in relation to any decisions by the airport authorities regarding charges on the users of the facilities at Knock.</P>
      <P>The charge to which the Deputy refers is not new. I understand from the airport authorities at Knock that it was introduced by the board of Knock Airport following the abolition of intra-EU duty free sales in mid-1999 and it is currently levied at a rate of &euro;7.50 per departing passenger.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to supporting the regional airports, including Knock Airport, and in this regard I have maintained and enhanced a range of regional airport grant schemes with a view to sustaining the regional airport network into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, under my Department's grant scheme for support of the marketing, safety and security measures at the regional airports, a sum of approximately &euro;444,000 was allocated to Knock Airport. Over the past three years, Knock <Col N="498" /> Airport has received almost &euro;1.25 million under this grant scheme from my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, five of the six regional airports are currently served by air routes linking them with Dublin Airport under the PSO regime which is subvented by my Department. Among these is the Knock/Dublin route which I established and launched as a new PSO service in January of last year and which is in receipt of a very substantial Exchequer subvention per flight.</P>
    <P>A sum of approximately &euro;10 million in 1999 prices was provided under the airports measure of the national development plan for the four airports in the BMW region &ndash; Donegal, Sligo, Knock and Galway. The primary aim of the measure is to provide grant assistance to support compliance by the airports with safety and security issues and also to aid where appropriate, certain infrastructural upgrades.</P>
    <P>The evaluation of the project submissions from Knock Airport, together with those from the other five regional airports, is currently being finalised by my Department and I expect that in the coming weeks I will be in a position to issue project approvals in respect of the NDP allocations for the regional airports in both the BMW and S&amp;E regions. I have no plans to provide Exchequer funds to any of the regional airports, outside of the three assistance measures outlined above.</P>

These include the introduction of two hourly services on the Cork-Dublin corridor. There are now six daily departures each way on this route. An hourly service on the Cork-Limerick-Galway corridor has been introduced with 14 daily departures each way. There is also an hourly service on the Waterford-Cork-Tralee route.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has informed me that demand for services has increased year-on-year on all routes operated by them. It is presently examining tenders for the supply of up to 67 new mainline locomotive-hauled carriages. When the tendering and procurement procedures are complete, it will take about two years for their delivery and entry into service. These trains, which are to be used on routes such as the Dublin-Cork line, will provide a significant improvement in the quality of mainline services.</P>
    <P>Over the period since 1997, work has been undertaken at Mallow station to make it more accessible to mobility-impaired passengers, while refurbishment work has been undertaken at Banteer.

At present 37 of these positions are filled while there are vacancies <Col N="505" /> for 20 doctors and four dentists. The most recent competition to recruit doctors for the medical corps was advertised in December 2000 and from it three doctors were appointed between July 2001 and September 2001.

Once these are completed the positions in the Defence Forces will be advertised.</P>
      <P>In common with other health service providers within the public sector, the Defence Forces medical corps is encountering difficulty in recruiting and retaining medical personnel. However, my Department, in consultation with the director of the medical corps, is seeking and will continue to seek to recruit additional personnel. I emphasise that in any case where doctors or dentists are not available, suitable local arrangements are made with civilian medical and dental practitioners to ensure that the appropriate level of professional care is available to members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>My Department has no information about participants under 66 in the 1994 early retirement scheme who have the invalidity pension, because it was not classified as a national retirement pension in the operation of that scheme and there was no need to record the information. At the behest of the EU Commission, however, the invalidity pension is classified under the new early retirement scheme as a national retirement pension whatever the age of the recipient. There are three participants in the new scheme who have the invalidity pension and are under 66.</P>

      <P>The person named added a new plot of land to his 2001 area aid application. This plot has been entered on to the Department's electronic database.</P>
      <P>The animal-based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. This scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and-or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department has now written to the person named with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to area-based compensatory allowance will be made on receipt of reply.

    <P>The person named applied for premium for eight animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme and for one animal under the 2001 <Col N="510" /> special beef premium scheme. A producer with more than 15 reckonable livestock units must submit a 2001 area aid application if he wishes to be paid premium on any animals in excess of 15 livestock units. As the person named has been paid ewe premium for more than 15 livestock units any payment under these 2001 bovine schemes is dependent on the outcome of his appeal regarding his area aid application.</P>
    <P>Any payment under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme is also dependent on the late area aid application issue being satisfactorily resolved. The person named has qualified for slaughter premium in 2001 in respect of one animal slaughtered during December 2001.

      <P>In accordance with EU regulations, arable aid may be paid to producers who produce arable crops on eligible land. Arable aid may also be paid on eligible land which is set-aside in accordance with the terms of the arable aid scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" />Under these regulations, eligible land is land which, on 31 December 1991, was not under permanent pasture, was not under permanent crops or trees, or was not used for non-agricultural purposes. Permanent pasture is land used for grass production for five years or more at 31 December 1991. Accordingly, the land had to be in tillage at some stage in the period 1 January 1987 to 31 December 1991.</P>
    <P>All payments issued by my Department are subject to checks and audits. This is an essential aspect of the control measures to ensure that expenditure of public moneys is accounted for correctly. In this context, an audit was carried out on the payments made under the 2001 arable aid scheme, the total value of which was &euro;130 million. The purpose of the exercise was to ensure that arable aid was paid on land that met the eligibility criterion set out. As a result it was necessary to write to some 5,000 applicants to clarify the question of eligibility. My Department is examining each response on its individual merits, taking account of the supporting documentation submitted and, where appropriate, by reference to archived satellite imagery. Where it is established that the land parcel(s) identified by the audit are eligible, this will be input onto the land parcel identification system.</P>
    <P>In view of the very considerable sums of money involved in direct payments to arable farmers, there is an onus on everybody to ensure that the benefits to the applicants are maximised, that avoidable penalties are not incurred and that there are robust and effective controls in place to ensure full accountability in the expenditure of public moneys.</P>

      <P>The importation of livestock from other EU member states is governed by a number of EU directives which establish, <i>inter alia</i>, the trade conditions and the veterinary certification requirements for such trade. In the case of the importation of pigs the relevant Council Directive is 64/432/EC, as amended, on trade in cattle and pigs. My Department as the competent authority under the directive applies the veterinary control measures necessary to implement the provisions of the directive.</P>

      <P>Nationally, REPS payments to date amount to just over &euro;1 billion and penalties amount to a little less than &euro;14 million or just under 1.4% of total expenditure. In County Galway, penalties at &euro;1.36 million amount to 1.17% of the total REPS payments of &euro;116.5 million in the county. Payment or penalty data on a townland basis, or statistics on average penalties imposed by REPS inspectors, are not available.</P>
      <P>With less than 1.4% of REPS payments being disallowed by way of penalties, it is clear that the vast majority of farmers are in compliance with the scheme. Penalties are applied in REPS where participants are not in compliance with the undertakings in the REPS plans which their planners have prepared in consultation with them. All REPS penalties can be appealed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The commonage framework plans will play a vital part in ensuring the long-term sustainability of farmers in the west of Ireland. The framework plans are objective assessments of commonages; their purpose is to establish environmentally sustainable farming practices to protect against degradation of commonage land, and to provide for the regeneration of commonages where degradation has already occurred. In the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Galway, Mayo and Kerry, farmers with commonage had already had their sheep numbers reduced by 30% on 1998 levels pending the completion of the framework plans. The framework plans now show that on some 65% of commonage land in these counties, the necessary level of destocking is less than 30%. Thus the majority of farmers will actually be better off as in virtually all cases they will have quota restored to them. While farmers using other commonages may have to destock further, in no case will any farmer be required to destock by more than 50% in 2003.</P>
      <P>The destocking element of the commonage framework plans is being implemented by way of a package of measures announced recently. These were developed within the confines of EU agreements and following discussions with thousands of farmers at public meetings. Taken together, they are designed to ensure that the environmental benefits of the framework planning exercise are achieved in a manner which also takes account of the realities of farming and the legitimate needs of the majority of farmers who did not collude in the reckless overgrazing of some commonages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" />I am confident the measures which I have put in place will have a significant positive environmental impact on commonages and, importantly, will now allow farmers to plan to bring their stock numbers in line with commonage framework plan requirements for 2003 and to opt for REPS or alternatively to apply to Dúchas for compensation payments. Subject in every case to the polluter pays principle, there are significant levels of funding available to sheep farmers from both these sources.</P>

      <P>As a member of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation, Ireland is in a position to avail of overseas trade opportunities which are essential for the development of our small open economy. Membership of these organisations brings with it reciprocal trade obligations.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need for measures to minimise any risks that might be associated with trade with third countries in food products, strict rules governing the importation of animal products from non-EU countries have been put in place at EU level.</P>
      <P>In particular, the country of origin and the establishment in which the product was produced must be approved in advance by the EU Commission. The granting of approvals is dependent on such factors as the animal health status of the country, adequacy of its veterinary structures, facilities of the production establishment and employment of good hygiene practices. Third country production plants are inspected by veterinary experts from the food and veterinary office of the European Commission.</P>
      <P>On arrival in the EU, third country product is subject to official inspection at the first port of arrival. This includes checks on accompanying documents and on identity and labelling as well as random physical checks on the product itself. If these checks indicate that everything is in order importation is authorised and thereafter the product may circulate freely. It must be borne in mind that particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scientific steering committee commission also assesses third countries for BSE risk and the commission attaches conditions to the import<Col N="519" /> ation of meat from cattle and sheep depending on the risk. There is no scientific evidence of BSE in poultry. The question of feeding of meat and bone meal to poultry in third countries is not dealt with in any of the relevant commission decisions, although in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, I understand that the feeding of meat and bone meal to all farmed animals, including poultry, has been banned since 1996.</P>

In processing the application for payment it was found that the details on the CMMS database relating to animal tag number XSVC0031A required further clarification. Details registered did not agree with information submitted by the applicant to his local livestock office regarding the movement of the animal. The district livestock office of my Department together with the applicant is endeavouring to have the movement details updated on the CMMS.

      <P>There is no change in the basic rule that a national retirement pension has to be deducted from any pension being paid under the schemes of early retirement from farming. This is a requirement of the EU Council regulations governing both schemes.</P>
      <P>The recent announcement refers to the agreement obtained from the European Commission that widow's and widower's pensions should not be regarded as national retirement pensions until a recipient reaches the normal retirement age of 66 years. Once these pensioners reach the age of 66, however, the amount of their early retirement pension must be reduced by the amount of widow's or widower's pensions that they receive. This was already the position under the previous early retirement scheme and the Commission's agreement relates to the new scheme.</P>

      <P>The 30 day holding period for purchases of susceptible animals, <Col N="523" /> which was introduced initially in the context of the foot and mouth emergency, is intended to slow down animal movement in order to limit the risk of spread of disease. The measure applies to all parties engaged in the movement of animals, i.e. farmers, marts, livestock dealers, agents, etc.</P>
      <P>General exemptions apply in respect of animals moved to slaughter plants, including slaughter plants in Northern Ireland; cattle moved for export from approved export assembly centres &ndash; some 14 stand-alone premises-ports, plus 23 marts approved for the clearance of cattle exports to Northern Ireland; cattle moved through some 19 premises used by live exporters to marshal cattle and test them prior to export.</P>
      <P>In so far as dealing operations are concerned, a number of exemptions to the 30 day rule are available to assist registered dealers and agents in the conduct of their business. These exemptions allow dealers and agents, under certain conditions, to purchase cattle from marts and sell them privately within the 30 days and to purchase cattle privately and sell them onwards at a mart or privately within the 30 day period. The dealers in question must make written application for the exemption, must satisfy certain conditions as to premises, disease testing, record keeping and animal welfare, must clear out their premises of all cattle at least once per fortnight and may not trade cattle from mart to mart within the 30 day period.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the 30 day rule as applied at present is a sensible precautionary measure in the context of limiting the spread of disease and that the exemptions in place are sufficient to facilitate farmers, marts, dealers, agents and exporters in their ongoing business. A 30 day retention requirement also applies in Northern Ireland with minimum exemptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186, 196 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>The national rural development forum was established following the publication of the White Paper on rural development in August 1999. The purpose of this forum is to debate current issues, review existing programmes to determine their impact and identify suitable policy responses to rural problems. As the Deputy acknowledges the forum is representative of a broad range of interests. It has a wide membership including Departments, State agencies, the regional assemblies and authorities, local authorities, the social partners, local development bodies and the wider voluntary and community sector. The forum meets on a bi-annual basis.</P>
      <P>The forum has met on three occasions to date: in Nenagh in May 2000, in Ballinlough in December 2000 and in Maam Cross in November 2001. The topics discussed at the meetings included the national spatial strategy, rural tourism, rural transport, rural proofing, banking and the rural population, rural post offices, the role of county development boards, the CLÁR Programme and planning issues in rural areas. A detailed progress report on the implementation of the White Paper is also presented at meetings of the forum.</P>
      <P>The direct costs associated with the organisation of these three meetings of the forum came to &euro;9,727.93, £7,661.37.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on rural development set out a clear vision and framework for the development of rural communities and marked a new approach and commitment by Government to rural development. One of its chief concerns is to diversify economically and to provide additional income and job creation opportunities in rural areas while cherishing the distinct features and culture of the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" />The national development plan is the vehicle for realising the aspirations of the White Paper. There is a specific chapter on rural development with a commitment to public investment of over &euro;8.5 billion over the period 2000-2006 in actions which directly impact on rural areas. These include REPS, ERS, headage and forestry, rural infrastructure, rural enterprises, capital investment, marketing, research development and training in agriculture related areas. Other measures in the NDP, for example relating to employment, infrastructure and social services also have direct impact on rural areas.</P>
    <P>The overall rural population has been relatively stable at around 1.5 million for some time and has shown an increase in the most recent intercensal period, 1991-96. On the basis of the 1996 census data, some 42% of the population live in small villages and in open countryside. However, if one excludes County Dublin, 58% of the national population live in rural areas. Rural Ireland is no longer the preserve of farmers. Nowadays the majority of rural dwellers are not farmers.</P>
    <P>While the Common Agricultural Policy faces a number of challenges, I do not accept the suggestion that it will be virtually dismantled within four years, nor, I believe, is there evidence to support such a claim.</P>
    <P>The Commission will be bringing forward proposals for the mid-term review of the agenda 2000 agreement later this year. In addition to the specific reviews which are provided for, the Commission may take the opportunity to present more general proposals. A number of member states are also seeking further reform of the CAP. However, no member state is calling for it to be dismantled. The Commission has recently published proposals for the accession negotiations with the EU applicant countries which are based explicitly on the application of the CAP, as it stands, to the new member states. Negotiations on the next WTO agreement are also under way and are scheduled to conclude by 2005. The negotiating mandate for the EU is based on the agenda 2000 agreement as decided by the European Council and stresses &ldquo;that safeguarding the future of the European model of agriculture, as an economic sector as a basis for sustainable development is of fundamental importance&rdquo;. The mandate provides a satisfactory framework for protecting the interests of European and Irish agriculture and food sectors.</P>
    <P>CAP reform is an ongoing process and further adjustments will be required from time to time. However, my objective in any negotiations will be to ensure that, as far as possible, the benefits of the agenda 2000 agreement are maintained and that any re-orientation of the CAP is suitable to the requirements of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The CLÁR Programme, Ceantair Laga Ard-Riachtanais, i.e. programme for revitalising rural areas, was launched in October 2001 and reflects the commitment in the programme for prosperity and fairness for a targeted programme of invest<Col N="526" /> ment in rural disadvantaged areas. The objective of the programme is to stem the social and economic costs of social exclusion. The 16 areas selected for the programme are those which have suffered the greatest population decline since 1926 with the exception of the Cooley peninsula, which has been included based on the serious difficulties caused by foot and mouth disease. The average population loss in all these areas is 51% and the total population that will benefit from the programme is 284,000.</P>
    <P>CLÁR will fast-track national development plan expenditure for state services and facilities in the selected areas and so enhance the quality of life of the people there. An extra, dedicated budget of &euro;25.4 million has been allocated to ensure the success of the programme in 2002 and 2003.</P>
    <P>From October to December last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív held 18 public meetings in the CLÁR areas to explain this initiative. These meetings were very well attended and there was great enthusiasm for the programme. At these meetings the Minister of State was given details of the priorities of the communities involved and these are being woven into the implementation of CLÁR. Priority investments, as identified by the communities, cover infrastructure, social and community services. The programme is being implemented by my Department with the communities in the selected areas through the aegis of the county development boards.</P>
    <P>During the same period, Deputy Ó Cuív had a plenary session of the inter-departmental committee on rural development involving the relevant Departments and since then has had bilateral meetings with these Departments and their agencies, as appropriate, to agree the elements of the programme.</P>
    <P>The priorities identified in the selected areas based are being adhered to on three modules: (1) local authority &ndash; roads, water, sewerage, village renewal, coastal erosion and piers; (2) industry, enterprise and tourism; and (3) health, education and community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív has agreed funding packages with the Department of the Environment and Local Government on roads and water. He expects to finalise a programme on village or town renewal and other environmental works shortly. He has had discussions with the local authorities and the Leader companies on this and hopes to be able to make an announcement soon on the details.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in discussions with the relevant Departments and State agencies on the elements of modules 2 and 3 and will make announcements on these shortly.</P>
    <P>I agree the provision of adequate data is essential for better policy making. To that end my Department has commissioned a study by the ESRI which will look at income distribution, poverty, deprivation and viability in a study of both farm and non-farm households. It will compare <Col N="527" /> and contrast the economic viability of farm households with non-farm rural households and urban households.</P>

      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to FAPRI-Ireland's report, &ldquo;Outlook 2001: Medium Term Analysis for the Agri-Food Sector&rdquo;, published in April 2001.</P>
      <P>This report provides a baseline &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; analysis of prospects for the agricultural and food sectors over the period 2001 to 2010. It also analyses a range of possible policy changes. The baseline projections estimate an increase of 4% in aggregate farm income in nominal terms over the period 2000 to 2010.</P>
      <P>Average farm income is calculated by dividing aggregate farm income by the number of farms. As current trends suggest that there will be a decline in farm numbers, mainly in small farms under 20 hectares over the same period, average farm income is likely to be similar, or higher, in 2010 compared to 2000.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that more than 60% of farm household income now comes from off-farm activities. This part of farm income is not included in the FAPRI-Ireland analysis but is likely to continue to grow, as the number of part time farmers increases in the future.</P>
      <P>My Department supports and monitors this important and useful econometric research done by FAPRI-Ireland. Their work is ongoing and the results of their latest analysis are due to be published at the end of April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>In November 2000 I established an organic development committee, as recommended in the report of the agri-food 2010 committee and I understand that the committee is in the final stages of its deliberations and will submit its report shortly. I am aware that the committee, on which Teagasc is represented along with the other major stakeholders in the organic sector has given particular consideration to the areas of research, advice, training and edu<Col N="528" /> cation and will be making recommendations on these subjects that are designed to enhance the scope for the development of the organic sector. I look forward to receiving the committee's report and I will give careful consideration to their recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that organic farming should be recognised not so much as an alternative to mainstream agriculture but rather as a part of it, offering real opportunities to Irish farmers in an expanding and potentially very lucrative market. While I expect the recommendations of the organic development committee to make a major contribution to the development of policy for the organic sector, my Department has already given very substantial support to the sector through the rural environmental protection scheme and the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector.</P>
      <P>Under the first REP scheme introduced in 1994, 821 organic farmers received financial support totalling more than &euro;28 million and I hope under the new scheme which began in 2000 this achievement will be considerably surpassed. For the period to 2006 the Government has provided more than &euro;8 million for the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector to support both on-farm and off-farm investment, and I would encourage both farmers and food processors to make use of this scheme to develop their activities in a way that will allow them to seize the opportunities offered by the growing demand for organic produce.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 20 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of his application it was found that six animals were sold inside the six months retention period and were not replaced as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme. A formal notification dated 10 December 2001 issued to the applicant informing him that no suckler cow payment could be made for 2001 as clause 26 of the terms and conditions of the scheme had been contravened. The person named was informed that he could appeal this decision by contacting my Department within 21 days. There has been no further correspondence regarding this matter.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for eight cows and two heifers under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of the application it was found that animal tag number VPYK0078S listed as a cow was actually an in-calf heifer. The applicant was informed on 13 November 2001 that under clause 34(a) of the terms and conditions of the suckler cow premium scheme no payment would issue under this scheme for 2001. The herdowner appealed this decision. Following a further review of the case the animal in question has been deleted from the application leaving nine eligible animals. The maximum number of heifers that can be accepted in an application covering nine animals is 1.8. Payment of his 100% entitlement for seven cows and 1.8 heifers will issue within the next ten days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the report of the agri-food 2010 committee. This committee was established in 1999 with the following terms of reference: &ldquo;To propose a strategy for the development of Irish agriculture and food over the next decade, following the agreement on Agenda 2000, and in the light of the changes and challenges which are likely to evolve nationally and internationally over that period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Taking existing trends and other factors into account the committee, in its report published in March 2000, estimated that there would be &ldquo;around 20,000 full-time farmers, 60,000 part-time farmers, and a transitional group of about 20,000 by approximately 2010&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In response to the committee's report and after consultation with relevant interests, the Government published the agri-food 2010 plan of action in August 2000. The plan of action recognised that the committee's projections of farmer numbers are tentative estimates, dependent on a range of assumptions, and are not in any sense suggested targets. The plan of action states clearly the Government's commitment to the development of a core of full time farmers earning viable returns on both capital and labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's objective of ensuring the highest possible number of full-time farmers will be facilitated by the wide range of supports received by these farmers, the benefits of agenda 2000 and the measures in the agri-food 2010 plan of action itself. The Government's commitment <Col N="538" /> to these measures is underlined in the agri-food 2010 implementation report, published in December 2001, which showed that 94% of the plan of action's points had been completed or seen substantial action undertaken. At the same time the plan of action points out that our growing economy offers attractive off-farm job opportunities for many families on smaller farms. The future of our rural communities should be underpinned by allowing farm family members to share in the benefits of our national economic performance. Therefore the number of full and part-time farmers in the future will be dependent on the decisions made by farm families themselves. The Government's aim is to support actively farm families in whatever decisions they make about their future.</P>

      <P>The Western Development Commission was established on a statutory basis on 1 February 1999. Its remit is to foster and support the economic and social development of the western region, namely, all the counties of Connacht, plus Clare and Donegal. This includes close co-operation with the new regional assemblies, the regional authorities and other public and private bodies in the region, as well as all Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The western development commission is responsible for the operation of the &euro;32 million western investment fund in its area. The fund contributes to the strategic development of the area through investments in business start-up; growth oriented small and medium enterprises, SMEs, as well as in community based developments aimed at encouraging enterprise development in the area. To date, 24 projects have been approved out of 120 applications for assistance totalling &euro;4.3 million. A total of &euro;1.7 million has been disbursed from the fund to aid ten of these projects. The WDC expects that there will be a significant increase in these figures by the end of 2002. The fund provides assistance through the provision of loans or equity but does not provide grant aid.</P>
      <P>In operating the fund, the western development commission operates an investment policy to ensure it complies with the provisions of the WDC Act, 1998 relating to the viability of projects. The conditions are not more stringent than the commercial banks.</P>

      <P>The legislation governing the establishment of the new independent agriculture appeals office was enacted in July 2001. It is envisaged that the office will be operational in the spring of this year.</P>
      <P>The office will be based in Portlaoise and will have a staff of approximately 22 at the outset and this will be reviewed based on actual experience of workload. The Civil Service Commission interdepartmental competition for the appointment of the director of the office has been advertised. The selection process for the appeals officers has been initiated and the recruitment of the remaining staff will commence shortly thereafter. Arrangements for the provision of the necessary accommodation are well advanced.</P>
      <P>When the director is appointed and the new office is established appeals made to the director under section 7 of the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Act and any regulations made thereunder in relation to procedures to be followed on such appeals.</P>

      <P>Following a compliance inspection, a penalty was imposed for failure to provide planned waste storage facilities, which is a fundamental and serious breach of the undertakings that the persons concerned had entered into under REPS. They appealed the penalty locally but were unsuccessful, and they were then informed of their right to appeal to the national REPS appeals committee. The appeals committee has received no appeal from them so far. The persons named may still exercise their right of appeal to the REPS appeals committee. <Col N="540" /> The committee is independent and its decisions are final.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The rationalisation of the domestic abattoir sector is due to a number of factors including competition in the market, developments in the retail sale of meat and the application of minimum EU standards for hygiene. Given the absolute priority of food safety and the protection of the consumer, the regulations designed to achieve these objectives must of course be fully complied with, and where they are not adhered to, my Department has no option but to refuse to issue licenses. With regard to grant assistance, provision was made under the national development plan for the food sector, to assist capital projects in the livestock sector, including domestic abattoirs. The rate of aid is 40% of approved eligible costs and generally investments exceeding &euro;100,000 will be considered for assistance. I am pleased to say that in a recent review of requests for assistance under the NDP, out of nine applications submitted by domestic abattoir operators, three have qualified for assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>The tax reliefs for the areas and sub-areas designated under the town renewal scheme were provided for under section 89(<i>a</i>) of the Finance Act, 2000. The scheme provides for capital allowances of 100% in respect of qualifying construction or refurbishment expenditure incurred on qualifying commercial buildings and capital allowances of up to 100% in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of qualifying industrial buildings. In the case of lessors the relief is written off at 50% in year one and the remainder at 4% per annum. Owner-occupiers can qualify for similar relief but can also avail of free depreciation of 50%, which allows the owner to defer writing off the year one allowance if they so wish.</P>
      <P>The reliefs outlined above were subject to European Commission approval in the context of State aid and were notified to the Commission in July 2000. Agreement was reached with the Commission in March of last year to allow the application of commercial and industrial incentives to the majority of projects under the town renewal scheme. Details of the new arrangements which are tailored to meet the Commission's requirements on State aids were announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government on 16 March 2001 and the reliefs were introduced with effect from 6 April 2001. In view of the delay in reaching agreement with the Commission on the commencement of the commercial and industrial element of the scheme, the termination date of the scheme has been extended from 31 March 2003 to 31 December 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incentives are available to small and medium enterprises, enterprises defined by the EU as having certain characteristics including a staff of fewer than 250 employees, with either an annual turnover not exceeding &euro;40 million or an annual <Col N="545" /> balance sheet total not exceeding &euro;27 million. In detail, the range of projects that have been cleared to proceed from 6 April 2001 following discussions with the European Commission are:</P>
    <P>All new build SME projects &ndash; such projects will be eligible for both commercial and industrial incentives: Refurbishment projects in the following categories: </P>
    <P>(a) SME projects where the expenditure incurred is below &euro;800,000 will qualify for the full range of commercial and industrial incentives;</P>
    <P>(b) SME projects which involve both expenditure on refurbishment and the provision of an extension where the cost of the extension is at least 25% of the market value of the existing building. This category will also qualify for commercial and industrial incentives;</P>
    <P>(c) Local retail SME projects excluding mail order and financial services. Incentives for office and industrial development other than those covered under (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are therefore excluded.</P>
    <P>Projects which qualify under any of the three refurbishment categories outlined above are eligible under the scheme. Refurbishment projects which do not fall within these categories have been the subject of ongoing discussions with the EU Commission. It should be noted in this connection that following the successful conclusion of the discussions that I have put down an amendment on Report Stage of the 2002 Finance Bill which will remove the conditions at (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) above and accordingly enable all refurbishment projects to proceed where they meet the SME conditions.</P>
    <P>Provision to allow the implementation of these arrangements was included on Report Stage of the Finance Bill, 2001. The provision also provided that capital allowances will not apply in respect of expenditure incurred, on or after 6 April 2001, on industrial and commercial premises in designated areas under this scheme where any part of that expenditure is met by way of grant assistance from State bodies or elsewhere. This amendment was made in order to ensure that the scheme complies with the European Commission's regional aid guidelines for the period to 2006 and similar amendments were made on Committee Stage in respect of the urban and rural renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme also provides for relief in respect of expenditure incurred on the refurbishment, conversion or construction of residential property. In the case of rented residential property, relief is available against all Irish rental income in respect of 100% of qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment, conversion or construction of qualifying property. Owner occupiers can also avail of relief of 100% over ten years against all income in respect of qualifying refurbishment-conversion expenditure incurred on qualifying residential property. In the case of con<Col N="546" /> struction expenditure incurred on residential property, owner occupiers are entitled to relief at 50% of the qualifying expenditure over ten years against all income. These reliefs were not subject to European Commission approval and were introduced from 1 April 2000 and will run until the scheme's deadline of 31 December 2003.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's commitment to increasing the supply of residential accommodation provision is being made in the 2002 Finance Bill to allow for an increase in the number of sites in both the town renewal scheme and the urban renewal scheme that can qualify for residential investor relief in addition to owner occupier relief. Section 25 of the Bill amends both the Urban Renewal Act, 1998, and the Town Renewal Act, 2000, in order to allow the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to recommend to the Minister for Finance that certain areas be designated for the purposes of rented residential relief in relation to construction, conversion or refurbishment expenditure incurred on certain residential accommodation. The areas in question are certain areas that have already been recommended for residential owner-occupier relief. This amendment will apply in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 5 December 2001 and in certain cases for expenditure incurred prior to 5 December 2001 subject to conditions.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware the full range of reliefs available under the town renewal scheme have been in operation for less than one year. It is therefore premature at this stage to review the operation of the scheme or to ascertain the take up of these reliefs. In addition, it is also too early to give consideration to the possibility of extending the scheme's deadline beyond 31 December 2003.</P>

Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this may be appealed to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, which is an independent body whose decision is final. Neither my Department nor the Revenue Com<Col N="547" /> missioners has any role in the medical assessment of persons for the purposes of the relief.</P>
      <P>In this case I understand that the senior area medical officer refused the person concerned the issue of a primary medical certificate. The board of appeal upheld this refusal after an assessment which was carried out on 3 November 2001. It should be noted that it is the nature and extent of the disability which determines a person's eligibility under the scheme rather than the circumstances which have given rise to that disability.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for admission to the scheme without the issue of a primary medical certificate. The scheme is currently under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria. I understand that the work of the group is at an advanced stage. Any proposals whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise which may emanate from the review group will receive full consideration. Until such time, no amendments to the scheme will be considered. For the Deputy's information, there are other State funded schemes aimed at mobility, namely a mobility allowance and a motorised transport grant, both of which are payable by the health boards.</P>

      <P>Under the self assessment system for payment of income tax, a person is obliged to pay preliminary tax on 31 October each year. The amount that has to be paid is the amount which, in the opinion of the chargeable person, is likely to become payable by that person for that income tax year.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the document received by this person was a reminder that no preliminary tax payment had been received. The person has now indicated that a &ldquo;nil&rdquo; amount of preliminary tax is appropriate in her case and arrangements have been made to note her tax record accordingly.</P>
      <P>If the person's income is such that no income tax will be payable in future years arrangements can be made to regard her as &ldquo;exempt&rdquo; from income tax and remove her from the self assessment system. This would avoid the necessity of making preliminary tax declarations and income tax returns in future years. If she is eligible and wishes to pursue this possibility she should forward a formal letter to her Inspector of Taxes providing relevant details of income and circumstances.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental review of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme is ongoing. The group was set up in 1998 and is chaired by an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand the work of the group is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>The work of the review group is complex. As part of its deliberations, the group has heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days and has received over 260 written submissions from interested parties. While definitions of disability vary, I have been informed that there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with less severe medical conditions than those which are covered by the scheme and persons with medical conditions which are not covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme. Therefore, many factors have to be taken into account by the review group and many interests balanced. This work and analysis takes time. The report will be published once the deliberative process is fully completed.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in addition to a personal tax credit of &euro;1,520 and a one parent family credit of &euro;1,520, the taxpayer <Col N="549" /> is entitled to a widowed parent tax credit of &euro;2,100 in the current tax year. A revised certificate of tax credits for 2002, to include the widowed parent tax credit, is in the process of being issued.</P>
      <P>A person who is a widowed parent can claim a widowed parent tax credit in each of the five years following the tax year in which the taxpayer's spouse dies. As the taxpayer's husband died in January 2001, namely, during the 2000/2001 tax year, she is entitled to a widowed parent tax credit of £2,000 (&euro;2,540) for the 2001 tax year. If the taxpayer's husband had died during the 2001 tax &ldquo;year&rdquo;, namely, the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001, she would be entitled to a bereaved parent tax credit of &euro;2,600 in 2002. The widowed parent tax credit was not included in the taxpayer's tax credits for 2001 and she may have overpaid tax as a consequence. However, there may be some additional tax due on her widow's pension, which is liable to income tax.</P>
      <P>In order to calculate the amount to be refunded to the taxpayer, the inspector of taxes needs to have her P60 for 2001. The taxpayer is advised to send her P60, available from her employer, to the inspector as soon as possible. This will enable the inspector to review the taxpayer's income tax liability for 2001 and refund any tax she may have overpaid in that year.</P>
      <P>For future years, the taxpayer will be entitled to a widowed parent tax credit of &euro;1,600 in 2003, &euro;1,100 in 2004 and &euro;600 in 2005.</P>

Havisham House was intended as a short-term solution to the asylum seeker accommodation crisis. The works carried out were the minimum necessary to bring the premises to an acceptable standard. However, when a more suitable site &ndash; Cork Airport Hotel &ndash; was identified, negotiations for the finalisation of the lease were abandoned on Havisham House and the renovation costs incurred were recouped in full to the State. Asylum seekers are now located in purpose built accommodation on the Cork Airport site. The allocation of accommodation to asylum seekers is not a matter for my office.</P>

The examples are based on the assumption that the married couple are jointly assessed for tax purposes and, where relevant, are entitled to the Home Carers Tax Credit. It is also assumed that all earners are on full rate PRSI.</P>

      <P>I received the letter in question on Thursday, 28 February and will reply formally to it shortly. It concerns the vesting day for the new OSI, the appointment of a board and discussions with the staff. I signed an order on 27 February setting 4 March 2002 as the vesting day for the new OSI. I have also appointed a board which includes a prominent trade unionist. No commitment was given to specific consultations with OSI trade unions on this appointment. Because of these developments I consider it neither necessary nor desirable to rescind the vesting day order. As regards discussions between management and staff, I understand that the major issues have been resolved and that discussions are continuing within OSI on some of the details. I am confident that there is sufficient goodwill on all sides to resolve any residual issues.</P>

That is a matter for the senior area medical officer of the appropriate health board who will issue a primary medical certificate where the qualifying medical criteria are met. Where the issue of a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal the decision to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal. This is an independent board whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The scheme is currently under review by an interdepartmental group chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria. I understand the work of the group is at an advanced stage. Any proposals &ndash; whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise &ndash; which may emanate from the review group will receive full consideration. Until such time, no amendments to the scheme will be considered.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> Since the 1 January 2002 income tax relief on secured mortgages is given through the tax relief at source system.</P>
    <P>Where an individual is house sharing, i.e. is in receipt of payment for the use for the purposes of residential accommodation of a room or rooms in his sole or main residence for a year and the gross receipts do not exceed &euro;7,620 in a year, the income from such receipts is treated as nil for tax purposes. This is usually referred to as the rent-a-room scheme. As the person is not charged tax on such rents, the question of a deduction for interest on borrowings does not arise against such rents. Provided the ceiling of &euro;7,620 in gross receipts from the rent-a-room is not exceeded, tax relief for mortgage interest, which is now given at source by the lender, is not affected.</P>
    <P>If the payments for house-sharing received by the individual exceed &euro;7,620 in a year, the individual would in effect be taxable as an investor on the profits from such payments and would be entitled to deduct a proportion of the interest on money employed in the purchase, improvement or repair of the property in arriving at such profit. The proportion would be based on the part of the property which is let. Mortgage interest relief at source could be claimed for the balance of the interest.</P>
    <P>Where parents had borrowed to finance a loan to the child for the purchase of the house by the child, no tax relief would be available to the parents for the interest on such borrowings. A person who borrows, on the security of their existing house, to purchase a property for letting, would be entitled to relief for the interest on such borrowings in arriving at the profit rent from the let property. Interest on a loan which was used for some other purpose, for example to finance the purchase of their principal private residence, cannot be offset against the rental income.</P>

      <P>The necessity of continued stocking of iodine tablets as part of the health input into the national nuclear emergency plan was reviewed as part of an update of the overall plan which is co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise. It was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I accepted this recommendation and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, acting on behalf of my Department, made the necessary arrangements as a matter of urgency for tendering and purchasing of new stocks.</P>
      <P>The European Commission was notified on 19 October 2001 of our invitation to tender for the supply of iodide or iodate tablets. The procedures laid down under Directive 93/36/EEC, which allow for an accelerated tendering process with regard to the award of public supply contracts, were followed to enable purchase of these stocks at the earliest possible opportunity.  Following a thorough examination of the five tenders submitted to the ERHA a contract for the supply of potassium iodate tablets was awarded to Kelkin Limited, Unit 1, Crosslands Industrial Park, Dublin 12, on 21 December 2001. Furthermore, the relevant statutory instrument requiring medicines to have product authorisations was amended to facilitate the placement on the market of these tablets without such authorisation.</P>
      <P>The award criteria for selection of a supplier were specified in both the tender notice and tender document as the most economically advantageous tender having regard to the date of delivery, shelf life, continuity and security of supply, quality, aesthetic and functional characteristics, technical merits, after sales service, technical back-up and price.  The selection of the successful contractor was based on price and the ability to comply with the prescribed award criteria as outlined. The cost of the contract will be approximately &euro;630,000.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The strong and consistent legal advice available to the Government is that the constitutional position of the morning after pill and post-coital intra-uterine device is not open to doubt and that it is fully compatible with Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution. I understand that the Irish Medicines Board has received similar but independent legal advice. There is, therefore, no question of an infringement of the civil law. The acceptance or rejection of the proposal in the referendum on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution will not change the constitutional law status of the morning after pill or IUD.</P>
      <P>The criminal law on abortion in Ireland at present is contained in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. The morning after pill is currently the subject of legal challenge in the English High Court under the terms of that Act. Section 6 of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act would repeal sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. This new legislation, which would protect unborn human life after implantation in the womb, would replace those sections with a definition of abortion which would prevent any case being made that the morning after pill or IUD could be termed abortifacient or subject to criminal sanction.</P>
      <P>In summary, there is currently no civil or constitutional law doubt about the morning after pill or IUD. That will not be altered by the acceptance of this referendum proposal. There may be criminal law doubt and the new law proposed would ensure that the use of the morning after pill or IUD would no longer come within the scope of the criminal law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 and provide for notification to, and inspection by, health boards <Col N="567" /> of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, child minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Details of deficiencies in services identified during inspection are outlined in writing to the provider and the provider is required to outline measures that will be put in place to deal with the deficiencies. While taking cognisance of their statutory duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare of children the health board pre-school inspection teams work in a supportive way with the providers to ensure that planned improvements are made. I understand from the health boards that the experience of the pre-school inspection teams is that the majority of pre-school providers wish to achieve a high standard of service and work in partnership with the teams to achieve and maintain this standard.</P>
    <P>Where serious breaches of the regulations concerning the health, safety and welfare of children identified during an inspection are not rectified within specified time scales, health boards can bring the matter to the attention of the District Court under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number of people suffering from polycystic kidney disease is not routinely collected by my Department. However, I have asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the chief executive officers of the health boards to examine the matter and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>However, the number of hospital in-patient admissions with a principal diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease in 1999 was 43 and in 2000 was 69. The figures for 2001 are not yet available and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Health Research Board is the statutory body with responsibility for health research in Ireland.

The provision of funding for science and health research is, in the first instance, a matter for the HRB.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that the HRB is not currently funding research in this area. The HRB funds research across a broad spectrum of health areas following a process of open competition and international peer review.

      <P>A submission from the Post Polio Support Group has been received and has been considered in my Department.</P>
      <P>At present, there are no proposals to extend automatic eligibility to people affected by this condition. However, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, <Col N="571" /> hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to extend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with polio.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the drugs payment scheme with a threshold of &euro;53.33 which replaced both the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme with effect from 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>Since that date a common list of reimbursable items operates for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. Previously, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme were being reimbursed under the community drugs schemes. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services and the drugs payment scheme in relation to the range of items paid for by the State under both schemes.</P>
      <P>For any item of medicine to be included in the common list of items reimbursable under the community drug schemes it must comply with a list of criteria. These range from their authorisation status where appropriate, their price and in certain cases the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" />If the Deputy provides the name(s) of the medicines for which reimbursement was not made I will have further inquiries made in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is well aware of the services that people require to combat the late effects of polio. Since coming into office, this Government has allocated just over &euro;175 million for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, &euro;29.616 million has been provided specifically for aids and appliances up to the end of 2001. The aids and appliances funding for this year has not yet been allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, &euro;27.302 million has been allocated for home supports including personal assistant services from 1997 to 2002 inclusive. This level of funding is indicative of this Government's on-going commitment to the development of the broad range of home support services which are required to enable people with disabilities to live as independently as possible and also to provide relief to a significant number of carers. At present, there are no proposals to extend automatic eligibility for medical cards to people suffering the late effects of polio. However, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to <Col N="573" /> individual family members on this basis. In addition, non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to examining the feasibility of introducing a &ldquo;Cost of Disability&rdquo; payment. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states that the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance will set up and participate in a working group which will consult with the social partners to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment.</P>
    <P>The working group has commenced its work. It is being chaired by the Department of Health and Children and also includes representatives of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Department of Finance, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July 2001. The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the average time it takes from the receipt of a smear in the RCSI laboratory to the issuing of a report is 13 weeks. The ERHA further advises that urgent requests are at all times given priority treatment and that the average time taken from the arrival of an urgent smear in the laboratory to the issuing of a report is generally less than two weeks.</P>
      <P>If a smear requires the expert attention of pathologists, the processing of smears may take longer, to ensure that the patient receives the benefit of the opinion of a number of pathologists. The authority has stated that the RCSI laboratory receives an average of 40 to 50 smear requests marked urgent per week. Unfortunately the prioritising of so many smears can delay the screening of routine smears.</P>

      <Col N="575" />In regard to the two individual cases mentioned by the Deputy, I have arranged for the information to be forwarded separately to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The ERHA has stated that huge attempts are being made by the RCSI to recruit extra staff and that a national training programme is operated by the RCSI to try and increase the number of cytology technicians. The Deputy will be aware that 63% of all smears nationally are analysed within the eastern region and this level of demand puts increased pressure on turnaround times and staffing. Additional funding has been provided by my Department in 2001 and 2002 to the ERHA to fund the introduction of liquid-based technology in the processing of cervical cytology smears, the purchase of additional equipment and to employ extra staff. It is intended that the additional staff and improved technology will result in an increased capacity for processing smears for the region in the medium to long term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 and 288 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment on individual cases. However, I have been advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the South West Area Health Board, which currently provides the service for the region, is processing applications that were received from June 2000 onwards. I understand that exceptions to this would be where cases have been deferred.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the delays being experienced by applicants for inter-country adoption assessment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. Delays have arisen in recent years because of an increased interest in intercountry adoption, and difficulties being experienced by the South West Area Health Board, which to date has been providing this service on behalf of the three area boards, in recruiting social workers in the child care area, including inter-country adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment procedures is now being used in all health boards. The purpose is to streamline assessment processes for first and <Col N="576" /> second assessments so that resources are used effectively and to provide a transparent system that can be understood by all the parties. The framework has been welcomed by both health boards and couples.</P>
    <P>To reduce time spent by couples on waiting lists for inter-country adoption assessment in the ERHA additional funding of almost &euro;830,000 or £653,000 has been provided over the past four years on the following measures. To increase significantly the number of social workers in the service funding has been provided to raise the complement of social workers, whole time equivalent, to over 20. At the end of last year, because of ongoing difficulties over recruitment, there were only 9.5 social workers, whole time equivalent, in the service. To assign new administrative personnel to provide support for social workers. This is to free up social workers to concentrate on assessments, post-placement reports and other appropriate work. A onestop shop facility has been introduced to increase capacity for holding office based interviews and reduce the time that social workers spend travelling to and from clients.</P>
    <P>To fully implement the standardised framework discussions have been ongoing with the ERHA on further measures to address the problem. The authority has decided that two new assessment units will be established in the northern and east coast area boards and that the present service will become the unit for the SWAHB. I am advised by the ERHA that discussions are at an advanced stage with the three area boards on the arrangements for devolving the service with a view to having the service operational. A final decision as to the exact structure for the service in the region is expected shortly. The ERHA is currently recruiting a regional co-ordinator who will support the restructuring of the service.</P>
    <P>A letter has issued to all applicants notifying them of the impending changes to the current service and their place on the current waiting list. A further letter will be issued to all applicants informing them of any new developments as soon as possible. Subject to availability of staff, I would hope that this initiative will be successful in reducing the delays currently being experienced by the couples in the region. I will continue to monitor the situation in relation to the new arrangements for the new assessment centres.</P>
    <P>In addition to the initiatives taken by the ERHA, I have also recently written to the other seven health boards asking them to consider assisting the ERHA in carrying out inter-country adoption assessments. Unfortunately, none of the boards were in a position to release social workers to assist the ERHA in undertaking intercountry adoption assessments. Some boards have indicated that they may be in a position to offer assistance to the ERHA on the organisation and delivery of preparation courses in their respective regions. This is being followed up on by the ERHA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" />In addition, the ERHA has advised that a dedicated customer services officer is being appointed in the current service. This person will deal with all customer queries and should provide improved information on the inter-country adoption process.</P>

      <P>My Department has been playing an important role in promoting the environmentally conscious management of waste in the health services. In 1994, my Department issued a health services waste policy to all health boards and acute voluntary hospitals. The policy advocates good environmental and health and safety practices in the management, handling and disposal of all wastes generated in hospitals. The policy promotes the environmental principles of reduction, reuse and recycling. It places particular emphasis on the segregation of different waste systems. A degree of waste segregation is now practised throughout our hospitals and work is ongoing to bring about further improvements. In addition a comprehensive environmental management system leading to the environmental quality ISO14001 certification, which has been on trial at one hospital in Dublin, is now being promoted amongst the health boards.</P>

    <P>The additional income which derives from these increases will be used to fund the following: costs associated with the continued implementation of the service's redevelopment plan together with its blood quality and safety programme; costs arising <Col N="580" /> in respect of measures to minimise the risk of transmission of vCJD including the replacement of plasma and cryoprecipate with imported products; loss of income arising from the reduction in the demand for red cells through the introduction of blood conservation strategies in hospitals; costs of new mobile clinic in the western region and fixed donor clinics; increased donor recruitment and advertising costs; new HIV and hepatitis B core tests to enhance blood quality and safety; pathogen inactivation of labile blood products and increased pay costs under the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The amount set aside for IBTS price increases represents 8% of the total amount of development funding available to the acute hospital sector in 2002. There is therefore a requirement on the IBTS to deliver its services in a manner which ensures efficiency and value for money notwithstanding the necessity to continue to improve blood safety in line with international developments. My Department has requested the IBTS to reflect this objective in all of its activities, existing and planned. Given the impact of these increases on hospital development, I expect the IBTS to implement an efficiency programme to achieve greater economy and effectiveness without compromising blood safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive of the Irish College of General Practitioners is reported as having called for a review of general practitioner manpower needs in the context of the establishment of the national task force on medical staffing. The task force will, among other issues, consider the proposed development of a consultant delivered public hospital service and quantify the resource and cost implications involved. The task force will also address the reduction in working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors arising from the EU directive on working time and the medical education and training requirements of our hospital medical workforce.</P>
      <P>While the recommendations of the national task force on medical staffing will have implications for the number of general practitioners, the document Primary Care, A New Direction, published as part of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System for You, states that a needs assessment of the composition and number of primary care teams in each health board area will be carried out within guidelines and frameworks developed by the forthcoming national primary care task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" />Following the needs assessment, the national primary care task force will produce, in conjunction with the health boards, a primary care human resources plan to develop the capacity of primary care. The human resources plan will require the commitment and support of various professional providers and other staff involved in order to ensure that its successful development and implementation is progressed on a partnership basis. It will be based on the needs assessments to be carried out by individual health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 293 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the cardio vascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts, launched by the Taoiseach in July 1999 sets out an excellent blue print for tackling heart disease in Ireland in the long term. The cardio vascular health strategy addresses the common aspects of prevention of all cardio vascular diseases, as well as the detection, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with coronary heart disease. The overall aims identified by the strategy were to reduce the risk factor profile in the general population; detect those at high risk; deal effectively with those who have clinical disease, and ensure the best survival and quality of life.</P>
      <P>The rate of premature death from heart disease in Ireland is significantly higher than the EU average. Through the implementation of the strategy, the objective is to reduce Ireland's levels of premature deaths from cardio vascular disease to the EU average in the medium term and a long-term objective is to reduce our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. When the strategy was launched a number of implementation structures were established at national and regional level. These included the heart health task force, the advisory forum on cardio vascular health and regional committees at health board level. Through the prioritisation of the implementation the strategy as advised by the advisory forum on cardio vascular health and work of other groups a co-ordinated, systematic and sustainable approach to its implementation evolved. In the first three years of the strategy &euro;45 million has been allocated to its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost 300 additional posts were filled by the end of 2000 while a further 500 were planned for <Col N="582" /> 2001. These include health promotion officers to provide guidance on smoking cessation, nutrition and physical activity across a range of settings, community and hospital nutritionists, nursing staff in the community and hospitals, technicians essential to the diagnostic service, and cardiac rehabilitation staff including co-ordinators and physiotherapists.</P>
    <P>A national media campaign, Ireland needs a Change of Heart, which includes an all island physical activity campaign, get a life, get active and other health promotion campaigns such as NICO, an anti-smoking initiative, were developed and launched.</P>
    <P>On 28 February 2001, I announced Government approval for the drafting of a public health and tobacco Bill to give effect to the proposals in the policy document, Towards a Tobacco Free Society.</P>
    <P>At regional level a broad range of service developments and initiatives occurred in the areas of smoking cessation, nutrition, physical activity and dissemination of good practice.</P>
    <P>In regard to the introduction of nicotine replacement therapy to GMS patients from April 2001 from the launch of nicotine replacement therapy to November 2001, 33,289 prescriptions have been issued to medical card holders at a total cost of &euro;1 million. Discussions on the implementation of the pilot phase of the Programme for the Secondary Prevention of Cardio vascular Disease in General Practice with all stakeholders are now at an advanced stage. It is hoped that agreement will be reached shortly.</P>
    <P>At regional level funding has been used for the purchase of training equipment, defibrillators, and ECG transmission equipment and training has been provided for general practitioners and practice nurses and other community based staff on areas such as brief intervention techniques for patient counselling, information technology and life support.</P>
    <P>The National Ambulance Advisory Council has been replaced, on a statutory basis, by the Pre-hospital Emergency Care Council. Significant investment in cardiac equipment for use in ambulances has been completed.</P>
    <P>In relation to consultant posts, I have received and fully endorsed the interim report from the tripartite group chaired by Comhairle na nOspidéal. I have undertaken as a priority to address a means to begin the process of appointing some of these posts during 2002. In the meantime I am awaiting the final report from this group.</P>
    <P>Specific developments included extension of the catheterisation laboratory in Cork University Hospital; a pacemaker service in the South Eastern Health Board region; angioplasty services in the Mid-Western Health Board and provision of diagnostic coronary angiography at Sligo General Hospital on a sessional basis; and chest pain assessment facilities were considerably enhanced in the ERHA region.</P>
    <P>All boards have begun developing cardiac rehabilitation in acute hospitals. A national steer<Col N="583" /> ing committee to develop a hospital based heart attack register, Coronary Heart Attack Ireland Register, CHAIR, was established on 14 October 2001. As part of the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts &ndash; a pilot project of CHAIR has been set up in the Southern Health Board region. It is envisaged that the pilot will run for one year and following its evaluation a hospital based heart attack register will be established nationally.</P>

      <P>The cardio vascular health strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts &ndash; published in July 1999, recommended the development of a pilot study of a register of heart attack patients. As Minister for Health and Children, I announced the establishment of a national steering committee to develop a hospital based heart attack register &ndash; Coronary Heart Attack Ireland Register, CHAIR, on 14 October 2001. The national steering committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Peter Kearney, consultant cardiologist, will have responsibility for the management of the CHAIR project at national level.</P>
      <P>A pilot project of CHAIR has been set up in the Southern Health Board region and will involve a phased roll-out of the project in eight hospitals in the region. A local steering committee has been established to oversee the pilot and the Southern Health Board has recently recruited a project manager for the CHAIR project in its region. It is envisaged that the pilot will run for one year and following its evaluation a hospital based heart attack register will be established nationally. Funding of &euro;285,691 has been allocated towards the cost of running the pilot this year.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been ongoing with key stakeholders and a software company to develop a suitable database. These are now complete and it is expected that a contract will be signed shortly. It is expected that the commencement of the pilot project will begin in the South Infirmary-Victoria hospital in May 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of health related services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including cerebral palsy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Health boards provide a range of support services in order to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible within the community. A comprehensive community support service includes residential respite care, day care, home support services, including personal assistance services, nursing, therapy, counselling and family support, aids and appliances. Specialised residential care services are also required.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, this Government has provided significant additional funding of just over &euro;175 million for the maintenance and development of health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including people with cerebral palsy.</P>
      <P>The issue of transport to and from health services is recognised by my Department in the new Health Strategy, and I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of health services in the most accessible location is given due consideration by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector, is currently developing <Col N="585" /> a national physical and sensory disability database, which when complete, will provide a detailed picture of the service requirements of people with physical and sensory disabilities over a five year period. This database will enable a co-ordinated and planned approach to be taken to what is ultimately most important, the delivery of services to individuals as required.</P>

      <P>Like any child, children with autism may have co-incidentally another condition such as coeliac disease. In such circumstances a special diet, for example, gluten free would be prescribed. There is no universally accepted policy for screening children with autism for a variety of hypothetical disorders. The quality standards sub committee of the American Academy of Neurology approved 9 June 2000, states as regards diagnostic testing:</P>
      <P>There is inadequate supporting evidence for hair analysis, coeliac antibodies, allergy testing particularly food allergies for gluten, casein, candida and other moulds, immunologic or neurochemical abnormalities, micronutriants such as vitamin levels, intestinal permeability studies, stool analysis, urinary peptides, mitochondrial disorders including lactate and pyruvate, thyroid function tests or erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase studies.</P>
      <P>These guidelines are being regularly reviewed by my Department.</P>

The external review process in relation to the proposals submitted to the board is nearing completion.</P>
    <P>There are diagnostic and treatment services available within the health services generally to assist persons who have health problems arising from coeliac and other such diseases. These are available to children with autism through the usual referral channels.</P>

      <P>Following an examination by my Department and the chief executive officers of the health boards, a task force was established, and commenced work in December 2001, to determine the feasibility, implications and timescale of the roll out of the national programme. The task force's approach is to carry out an audit of facilities, cytology and histology laboratories and colposcopy clinics, and to identify gaps and resources needed to meet roll-out requirements in line with quality assurance standards. The experience gained from phase one will also assist in the determination of the feasibility, implications and timescale of the roll-out. It is expected that the task force will be in a position to report by mid-2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273, 275 and 362 together.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date, over 50,000 women have been called for screening and over 34,000 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of 70%.</P>
      <P>In relation to the current position in County Wicklow, I have been informed by BreastCheck that it will be commencing screening for women in Bray in May 2002 and they expect that it will take approximately 14 weeks to complete. BreastCheck also advises that no dates have as yet been formalised for the screening of women in the rest of Wicklow as two locations for mobile units to undertake this screening have still to be finalised. However, BreastCheck anticipates that the screening programme will be completed in Wicklow before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>As you are aware, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, were drawn up by the Minister for Finance and come under the remit of the Revenue Commissioners. The Department of Health and Children has no statutory responsibility for the regulations or their operation.</P>
      <P>To qualify, a person must meet one or more of the following medical criteria which are specified in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994, which are not set by the Department of Health and Children: the applicant is wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; the applicant is wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; the applicant is without both hands or without both arms; the applicant is without one or both legs; the applicant is wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg and the applicant has the medical condition of dwarfism and has serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>The medical assessment for and granting of a primary medical certificate for the purposes of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme is carried out by the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board. This function is to assist the Department of Finance who have statutory responsibility for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to my meeting with the delegation referred to by the Deputy in May 2001, I subsequently wrote to my colleague, the Minister for Finance about this matter. He advised me that the work of the review group which is currently examining all aspects of the scheme, including the medical criteria is ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Mid-Western Health Board is the statutory responsibility of that board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the unacceptable waiting list for orthodontic treatment in the MWHB but I note that some improvements have been made in relation to the treatment waiting list. For example, between June 2001 and December 2001, the treatment waiting list in the board has been reduced by 427. I have taken a number of measures to increase the capacity of the orthodontic service nationally.</P>
      <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. My Department would welcome proposals for a specialist training programme from this university and the consultant orthodontist of the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health <Col N="593" /> boards to, <i>inter alia</i>, recruit additional staff. The MWHB has been allocated an additional &euro;0.671 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which &euro;0.513 million was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board proposes to recruit additional staff and validate its orthodontic waiting lists. In addition, my Department approved a proposed scheme from the MWHB last year to engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    <P>For this year, my Department is exploring with all health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the chief executive officer of the MWHB has informed that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 1,593 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of 185 patients in treatment in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the September 2001 quarter. I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce the waiting list for treatment in the board.</P>
    <P>Finally, my Department has asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>

    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>
    <P>These figures show that the number of patients awaiting assessment and treatment fell by 1,133 and 1,613 respectively between June and December 2001. The chief executive officers of the health boards have further informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect. Finally, my Department has asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU, in response to the revocation of the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement ) Regulations, 1996, made a decision not to take on new patients on the methadone protocol. However, the IPU has indicated that pharmacists will exercise their discretion regarding new patients on a case by case basis and I welcome this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that all pharmacists within the methadone scheme have agreed to take any emergency case, namely, individuals who present <Col N="596" /> with HIV, suicidal tendencies, or who are under 18 or pregnant.</P>
    <P>For other cases the ERHA and the three area health boards are working to put in place contingency arrangements including extending the mobile bus service and increasing dispensing in their existing treatment services. The majority of opiate misusers reside in the ERHA region. Reports from other health board areas indicate that pharmacists are dealing with new individuals on a case by case basis and the boards are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure appropriate services are provided to all those who require them. I would urge everyone concerned in this action to ensure that this vulnerable group can access the required services.</P>

      <P>The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, provides for enabling powers for the Minister for Health and Children to prohibit or restrict smoking of tobacco products in many public places, including licensed premises. It is reasonable to extend environmental controls on smoking to more public places to ensure protection for the public from the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Following enactment of the Bill I will be consulting with relevant interests about introducing new regulations to extend environmental controls on smoking to a number of public areas and facilities not included in existing regulations including pubs.</P>

      <P>The Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age against a range of <Col N="597" /> potentially serious infectious diseases. Operational responsibility for the programme lies with the individual health boards which have appropriate regional and local management structures in place to manage the delivery of the immunisation programme. General practitioners enter into a contract with their local health board for the delivery of the programme.</P>
      <P>Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. MMR vaccine is available under the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme. The MMR is a safe and effective vaccine. Reactions to the vaccine are generally of a minor nature such as local soreness at the injection site, high temperature, and headache.</P>
      <P>There are some people for whom MMR vaccine is contraindicated. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations. These are taken into account by the general practitioner prior to the administration of the vaccine. Parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation. A history of anaphylaxis to a previous MMR immunisation is a contraindication.</P>
      <P>The advice of the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is that no child should be denied immunisation without thought as to the consequences. The committee further advises that where there in any doubt, advice should be sought from a consultant paediatrician or specialist in public health medicine. In such cases it is open to the paediatrician or public health specialist to advise as to the appropriate setting for administration of the vaccine.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. The IMB liaises closely with international bodies including the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the World Health Organisation.</P>

My Department recently wrote to the boards indicating that it is imperative that any outstanding bonus payments are processed and paid as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 to 305, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>These matters relate to agreements with the Irish Medical Organisation in respect of the Government's decision to extend medical card eligibility to all persons aged 70 and over. The agreements reflected agreed changes in remuneration packages for doctors from March 1999 with the first of a three phased doubling of the income limit for persons in this age category. Subsequent adjustments occurred in March 2000 and March 2001 and on July 1, 2001 when eligibility was extended to all persons in this age group regardless of income.</P>
      <P>Of the items involved there is agreement on some that full payment is due to the general practitioners involved but there are technical difficulties in agreeing the basis for the payments.</P>
      <P>There is ongoing difficulty at health board level in determining the precise number of discretionary medical cards in the system and in implementing a mechanism to trigger the payments. The ERHA and the health boards have been asked to expedite this matter so that appropriate payments can be made as quickly as possible</P>
      <P>A similar problem relates to asylum seekers in some health board areas. While this issue is being clarified an interim payment has been made to doctors of 50% of their claims for these patients. The method of payment for general practitioners in respect of the agreement on the phased doubling of the income limits is the subject of a difference of interpretation. The HSEA has offered to have this matter referred to an independent arbitrator for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the workload of general practitioners in respect of their treatment of asylum seekers did not form part of the agreement but my Department has responded to the IMO sug<Col N="603" /> gesting a methodology to progress this issue and a response is awaited.</P>
    <P>The GMS (Payments) Board has informed me grants have been paid to doctors in respect of part-time staff where appropriate supporting documentation has been provided. The board also indicates that retrospective capitation payments have been paid except for a small number of doctors who entered the GMS on a limited contract basis since 1 July 2001.</P>
    <P>All of the items at issue are being positively addressed and my Department is committed to the payment of all amounts due as soon as the correct basis for payment has been determined and the issue at dispute is resolved. Officials from my Department will be meeting with the IMO to discuss these issues further.</P>

      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. This list ensures equity between the general medical services and drug payment schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified.</P>
      <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from their authorisation status where appropriate, their price and in certain cases the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. As the product referred to by the Deputy does not have a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board it does not qualify for inclusion on the common list of reimbursable medicines.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that a protocol, a copy of which is included, was drawn up to set out the circumstances and conditions in which a necessary unlicensed medicine may be reimbursed by the State, where lawfully supplied. Applications for reimbursement which meet the circumstances and conditions set out in the protocol should therefore be made to the relevant agency i.e. the General Medical Services (Payments) Board or the local health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 311 and 312 together.</P>
      <P>The relevant regulations, which set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts which allowed pharmacies to dispense prescriptions under the medical card and drug payment schemes had been subject to ongoing legal challenges.</P>
      <P>During the course of those challenges, the legal basis of the regulations was raised. Against this background I sought legal advice from the office of the Attorney General. The advice received concluded that the regulations were <i>ultra vires</i>. Accordingly, and given this advice, I considered that I could not continue to operate the regulations and, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, whose consent is required, I proceeded to revoke them.</P>
      <P>The effect of the revocation, for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts, is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapsed with the regulations. Those affected should contact the relevant health board directly concerning re-applying. The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act.</P>
      <P>The Pharmacy Review Group, established by my Department to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland, is now being asked to report as quickly as possible, given the new situation. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. I am considering a number of options pending the completion of the work of the group.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group take account of consumer concerns by requiring it to consult widely with consumer interests. As well as a general invitation for public submissions a wide range of consumer organisations were specifically invited to make submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" />As Minister for Health and Children, my responsibilities centre on the provision of a high quality health service and this includes ensuring, in so far as is possible, that adequate and accessible pharmacy services are generally available. The decision to sell a pharmacy is a matter for the proprietor concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Pharmacy Act, 1962, provides for the keeping of open shop for the dispensing of medical prescriptions and sale of poisons. The legislation does not restrict the ownership of pharmacies but provides that the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions must be under the personal supervision of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; as defined under section 2(3) of the Act. A shop for the sale of poisons must also be under the personal management of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; as defined under Section 2(3). The European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications In Pharmacy) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 239 of 1987) and European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications in Pharmacy) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 330 of 1991) amended the Pharmacy Act, 1962, to further define an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;. The purpose of S.I. No. 239 of 1987 and S.I. No. 330 of 1991 was to give statutory effect in this country to EEC Council Directives 85/432/EEC, 85/433/EEC and 85/584/EEC. These regulations provide for the mutual recognition of qualifications in pharmacy in respect of nationals of member states and include the provision that a pharmacy in this State which has been in operation for less than three years shall not be managed or supervised by a pharmacist who qualified in another EC member state.</P>
    <P>My Department is working on a framework for a Pharmacy Bill to rationalise and update the Pharmacy Acts, 1875-1977. The issue of fitness to practice in relation to a number of professions, including pharmacy will be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of private health insurance is regulated under the Health Insurance Act, 1994, regulations made pursuant to that Act by the then Minister for Health and Children in March 1996 and the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001. The position in relation to persons aged 65, and over, joining or taking out a higher level of cover with an insurer has not changed since the regulations made in 1996 took effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1994 Act and the regulations made in 1996 provide for the operation of health insurance on a &lsquo;community rated' basis, that is, insurers must <Col N="607" /> charge the same premium for a given level of cover regardless of a person's age, sex or health status. That legislation also provides for &lsquo;open enrolment' which obliges insurers to make cover available to persons under the age of 65 regardless of whether or not they were previously covered, and &lsquo;lifetime cover'.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the consumers, the existence of &lsquo;community rating' represents a broad protection to the community as a whole in terms of individual insurance rate stability and equitable access to insurance cover. The viability of this system in a voluntary environment is dependent on people joining private health insurance at a young age. The surpluses that young healthy people contribute to the system facilitate the insurance of older, sicker people at premium rates that would not otherwise be affordable. The operation of &lsquo;community rating' would not be adequately served by facilitating either the deferral of health insurance cover until age 65 years or older, or facilitating increases in the level of cover, when the prospect of claiming benefits is greater. Such adverse selection is among identified practices against which community rating must be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Under the existing legislation, insurers must provide cover to persons under the age of 65. It is a matter for each insurer to decide if they will cover persons of, or over, the age of 65 who are seeking cover for the first time. Insurers are not prohibited from covering such persons, but if they decide to provide cover, they must do so on the basis of community rating.</P>
    <P>It is open to those persons of, or over, the age of 65 to increase their cover, say by opting for a higher level hospital plan, subject to waiting periods for payment of higher benefits. It is also open to persons of, or over, the age of 65 to transfer from one insurer to another without having to re-serve a waiting period already expired under the previous contract.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to the 2001 Act, regulations are to be made which will remove the discretion of insurers to refuse cover to persons of, or over, 65 who are not currently insured. This will occur in the context of moving to a system of 'lifetime community rating' which involves additional premium to people who enter health insurance for the first time at older ages. This will therefore strengthen the system by providing that late joiners will be liable to pay sufficient extra premium to make up for the surplus they would have contributed had they joined at a younger age, while enabling such persons to avail of cover.</P>

      <P>On Wednesday, 23 January 2002, I received the Irish Medicine Board's report entitled &ldquo;Herbal Medicines Project Final Report&rdquo;. This report is currently being considered in my Department.</P>
      <P>In June 2000, in the light of difficulties in the licensing of herbal medicinal products under current medicines legislation, particularly in relation to proving efficacy in accordance with existing EU requirements, I requested the Irish Medicines Board to develop a proposal for an interim national licensing system for &lsquo;traditional and alternative medicinal products, including herbal medicinal products'. A herbal medicines project manager was appointed to the IMB in September 2000 and a press advertisement was placed on 29 September 2000 in three national newspapers outlining the aim of the project and inviting public comment on all aspects of a possible interim national licensing scheme for traditional, alternative and/or herbal medicinal products. The total number of submissions received by the IMB was 41, all of which were accepted and reviewed. In addition, the IMB formally contacted those organisations known to it to have an interest in herbal medicines as follows: Consumers for Health Choice &ndash; CHC; Health Products Alliance &ndash; HPA; Irish Association of Health Stores &ndash; IAHS; Irish Association of Medicinal Herbalists &ndash; IAMH; Irish Health Trade Association &ndash; IHTA; Irish Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine &ndash; IRCHM.</P>
      <P>The Professional Register of Traditional Chinese Medicine, PRTCM, also contacted the IMB directly and was duly invited to make a submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the consultation process, the public and interested parties were asked to make nomi<Col N="609" /> nations for membership of an <i>ad hoc </i>Scientific Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products &ndash; SCHMP. The intention was that this committee should comprise a panel of scientific experts having a special knowledge in herbal medicines and/or related areas and that its role would be to advise and assist the IMB in matters pertaining to the development of an interim national licensing scheme. Dr. Desmond Corrigan, director of the School of Pharmacy, Trinity College Dublin, was nominated by a member of the public to serve on the <i>ad hoc </i>SCHMP and was also proposed by the IMB. Dr. Corrigan is an acknowledged international expert in herbal medicine-pharmacognosy and has been involved in this area at a European level for more than ten years. On this basis, the IMB invited Dr. Corrigan to be chairperson of the <i>ad hoc</i> SCHMP. The establishment of this committee was considered important for the success of the project and a total of 15 names were proposed as part of the consultation process. In addition, the IMB nominated eight candidates for consideration by the chairperson. Dr. Corrigan suggested one additional nominee. From the suggestions received, the chairperson selected those people whom he deemed appropriate and who were available to join the committee. The members were chosen with a view to establishing a balanced committee consisting of people from a variety of backgrounds who would effectively reflect and represent the many views and opinions in this area.</P>
    <P>It was the intention that the <i>ad hoc</i> SCHMP be established as a group of experts and not as a group representing interested parties. Consequently, members with expertise in the following disciplines were appointed to the committee and were required to sign a confidentiality agreement and to declare any conflicts of interest: pharmacognosy; phytochemistry; complementary medicine; general and Chinese medicine; general and herbal medicine; herbal medicine; pharmacy and aromatherapy.</P>
    <P>The committee had a total of seven meetings from December 2000 to September 2001.</P>
    <P>The following organisations also agreed to participate in the consultation process: College of Anaesthetists of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland &ndash; RCSI; Consumers for Health Choice &ndash; CHC; European Herbal Practitioners Association &ndash; EHPA; International Society of Professional Aromatherapists &ndash; Irish Branch &ndash; ISPA; Irish and International Aromatherapy Association &ndash; IIAA; Irish Association of Health Stores &ndash; IAHS; Irish Association of Medical Herbalists &ndash; IAMH; Irish College of General Practitioners &ndash; ICGP; Irish Health Trade Association &ndash; IHTA; Irish Herbal Practitioners Association &ndash; IHPA; Irish Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine &ndash; IRCHM; National Institute of Medical Herbalists &ndash; NIMH; Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland &ndash; PSI;</P>
    <P>In September 2001, the <i>ad hoc</i> SCHMP agreed the final draft of the herbal medicines project report prior to its release for public consultation. <Col N="610" /> This consultation process was available to the public through the IMB website for a period of four weeks from 1 November 2001 and following representations, I arranged for the closing date for public comment to be extended by a further four weeks to 27 December 2001. A total of 86 responses was received and these were all discussed by the committee and the IMB at a meeting in January 2002.</P>
    <P>Both the report and the IMB/SCHMP review of responses received through the public consultation are available on the Irish Medicines Board's website.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that it is not the intention of the IMB/SCHMP proposal that &lsquo;safe and favourite' remedies would no longer be available for sale to the general public. On the contrary the IMB/SCHMP wishes to ensure the continued availability of safe traditional medicinal products for sale in pharmacies, health food stores and supermarkets. Under the proposed scheme the consumer will have an assurance that the registered traditional medicinal products they buy are: 1) produced to an appropriate quality standard; 2) safe under the proposed conditions of use; 3) can be expected to act in accordance with an established tradition of use; and 4) are appropriately labelled.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also be aware that a proposed EU directive on traditional herbal medicinal products was agreed by the European Commission on 17 January 2002. This proposal will now be sent to the European Parliament and Council. I understand that the IMB/SCHMP proposal for an interim national licensing scheme is broadly in line with the proposed EU directive. Both the IMB's proposal and the proposed EU directive are currently being examined in my Department. As a follow up to the publication of its report, I have requested the IMB to organise a seminar for interested parties which will offer further scope to review the report's implications.</P>

      <P>Any person aged 70 years and over who has attended his or her general practitioner since 1 July 2001 and been charged for the visits will be entitled to a refund provided that the doctor concerned has applied to the local health board for inclusion in the GMS scheme under the special provisions of a limited contract to treat persons in this age category. My Department understands that the Irish Medical Organisation asked its members not to charge patients consultation fees during the interim period while their applications for inclusion in the scheme were being processed. Refunds will have to be made to the patients by the doctors concerned.</P>
      <P>On the question of refunds of moneys paid for prescribed medicines since 1 July 2001, my Department understands that several boards have in fact been processing these claims for refunds. A letter has issued to all other boards notifying them of this method of processing the outstanding claims.</P>
      <P>There should be no deductions from refunds of fees and the only deductions from refunds in respect of payments to pharmacies would be in respect of items not included on the GMS prescribed list of products.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, com<Col N="613" /> menced in March 2000, with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date, more than 50,000 women have been called for screening and more than 34,000 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of over 70%. BreastCheck is currently in discussion with health boards concerning expansion of the programme nationwide. My Department will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to nationwide coverage as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The report of the sub-group of the national cancer forum Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease was published in March 2000 and contains recommendations for the establishment of a network of specialist breast units throughout the country and the appropriate infrastructure, personnel and equipment which is needed for such specialist units. During the past year, there have been extensive consultations between my Department and the health boards in relation to the development of symptomatic breast disease services in their functional areas in the context of the report.</P>

      <P>The numbers on waiting lists for in-patient treatments in the specialties of ENT, gynaecology, orthopaedics and general surgery at Tralee General Hospital at the dates specified, in the format collected by my Department, are being provided separately to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Data on radiological services is not routinely collected by my Department. Therefore, my Department has asked the chief executive officer at the Southern Health Board to look into this matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The figures supplied to my Department by Tralee General Hospital show that considerable progress has been made in reducing the number of people waiting for in-patient services at the hospital in recent years. The number of people waiting for in-patient treatment at December 2001 was 106. This figure represents a decrease of 54% on the comparable figures for December 2000. The number of people waiting for general surgery has fallen by 96% during the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to announce recently the commissioning of an additional 16 beds at Tralee General Hospital. This represents an additional <Col N="614" /> investment for the hospital of &euro;1.7 million in both capital and revenue costs. These new public beds are part of the first phase of the provision of additional acute hospital beds as announced in the new health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You. This increase in bed capacity will help to continue the work which has been done in recent years in reducing the in-patient waiting lists at the hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323 to 325, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review known as the Moran Report was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards and as a consequence, structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Moran report recommended that the current policy of having a consultant-led service be continued and that each health board have a consultant orthodontist. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the orthodontic service of each health board is now consultant-led with the Eastern Regional Health Authority recruiting two <Col N="615" /> additional consultants; this brings the current complement in the authority to three.</P>
    <P>In addition, the recommendations of the Moran review group were that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service and that the regional orthodontic units be involved with the dental schools in the training of specialists. These recommendations are being implemented as follows.</P>
    <P>The Dental Council has established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics. Agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the introduction of the grade of specialist in orthodontics into the public service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations and its introduction will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics. In October last year, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North Eastern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. This is made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way. My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the post-graduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>Equally, the Moran review group recommended that auxiliaries be employed in the regional orthodontic units of the health boards. In order to enable the achievement of greater caseloads, the Dental Council has been approached concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics. This grade, to be <Col N="616" /> known as orthodontic therapist, will act as a support to the consultant orthodontists, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic units thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>The Moran report advised that the health board dental surgeon refer appropriate patients for assessment at regional orthodontic units through the principal dental surgeon and that orthodontic services should fall within the ambit of responsibility of the acute hospitals manager in each health board. Both of these recommendations have been implemented and the development of information technology systems in the regional orthodontic units, which was put forward by the Moran review group, is under way.</P>
    <P>I am cognisant that these structural changes may take some time to impact on waiting lists and, therefore, in the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. This initiative has enabled health boards to, <i>inter alia</i>, recruit additional staff. In addition, last year my Department approved a proposal from the Mid-Western Health Board to engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients under the initiative. The proposal provides for a scale of fees for various items of treatment up to a ceiling of &euro;2,920 per case and for various control and monitoring mechanisms. For this year, my Department is exploring with all health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. Funding for such arrangements is also being considered.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional &euro;1.191 million last year for orthodontic services of which &euro;1.032 million was for its orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board propose to recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, develop new orthodontic units in Tralee and the northside of Cork city and commission four additional orthodontic chairs at the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that the Local Appointments Commission has recommended a candidate for one of the two consultant orthodontist positions and the board has offered the post to him. The recruitment process for the second position in the board will shortly recommence.</P>
    <P>My Department does not routinely collect orthodontic waiting list data for County Kerry. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to investigate the position for the Deputy and reply to her directly. However, the chief executive officer has informed me of the following information in relation to its treatment waiting list at the end of the December 2001 quarter:<Col N="617" /></P>

    <P>Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officer of the board has informed that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 2,300 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. Nationally, the chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the same quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment in the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The restructured foster care allowance scheme, which was introduced last year, was designed to achieve the objectives of the recommendations of the working group on foster care: Foster Care &ndash; A Child-Centred Partnership. The new rates of foster care allowance for 2002 are &euro;270.50 per week per child under 12 and &euro;296.50 per week per child of 12 or over. The Department of Health and Children has indicated in the letters of determination to the health boards that it is proposed to increase the maximum contribution payable by a health board in respect of the boarding out scheme for older people. This will require regulations being laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The revised rates of maximum contribution payable are being considered at present.</P>
      <P>The foster care allowance is paid in respect of children who have been taken into the care of the health board under the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, for their care and protection, and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995. Foster care is the main form of alternative care for those children who cannot be looked after in their own home. Under the regulations a health board must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.</P>
      <P>The boarding out scheme for older people is designed to provide an alternative to nursing home care for older people. The two schemes, which are based on a different statutory and regulatory basis, are therefore designed to meet the needs of two completely different groups of people. There is no basis, therefore, for linking the two schemes and there are no proposals to synchronise the rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 338 and 359 together.</P>
      <P>I assume Deputy Farrelly is referring to the physical and sensory disability sector in this instance. In response to the Deputies' questions, there are a number of issues which I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify.</P>
      <P>This year, additional funding of just under &euro;40 million has been provided for the maintenance and development of health related support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This funding has been directed at a number of areas including &euro;12.7 million for the full year cost of 2001 developments; &euro;7.56 million for the development of home supports, therapies and other priorities as identified at local level; &euro;6.411 million towards the under-resourcing of voluntary sector service providers; and &euro;9.3 million for capital projects under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>This level of investment brings the total additional funding which has been provided by this Government between 1997 and 2002 for the physical and sensory disability sector to just over &euro;175 million.</P>
      <P>Each year, my Department endeavours to acquire the required level of funding for the health services by means of the Estimates process. At present, in terms of the physical sensory disability sector, it is difficult to estimate the precise levels of need. This is due to a lack of information on the numbers of people who are currently requiring health and personal social services. The national physical and sensory disability database, which I recently launched, will provide this information and develop an accurate picture of the levels and types of services which are required. This information will assist in the accurate assessment of the levels of funding required and will facilitate effective targeting of resources at the areas which require development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also acknowledged that the under-resourcing of the voluntary sector service providers, both in terms of staffing and core funding, is a significant issue in the sector and is one which is of great concern to the voluntary organisations, the health boards and to my Department. Despite significant resources being allocated to the voluntary organisations concerned, approximately £20 <Col N="624" /> million between 1997 and 2001, this issue remains unresolved. I will be meeting with the organisations concerned in the coming days to discuss the allocation of the above mentioned &euro;6.411 million and I propose that a review of the specialised health and personal social services being provided by these organisations and the manner in which they are funded, take place in the near future to ensure that this issue is resolved. I am anxious that an appropriate level of baseline funding be established for each of the agencies concerned.</P>

      <P>The Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1996, include provisions for the entry of paternity details in the register of births in respect of children born to parents not married to each other. As the Deputy may be aware, the Status of Children Act, 1987 amended section 7 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland), 1880 by the substitution of sections 7 and 7A. These sections set out the procedures allowing for the registration of paternity details in such cases and included a provision for the registration of the father's details in the register of births on the joint application for registration by the parents or on the application by one or other parents with cooperation of the other parent. DNA testings is not specifically required. In addition that Act also provided for the registration of paternity details on the sole application of either the father or the mother of the child on the production of a certified copy of a court order naming the father of the child.</P>

      <P>I am aware that severe shortages of trained personnel are currently affecting speech and language therapy services nationwide. In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists as well as for occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001 and concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places. The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve a fourfold increase in the num<Col N="627" /> ber of speech and language therapists over the next decade.</P>
      <P>An Inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group with a view to allocating the increased course places as soon as possible. In addition, I understand that the Northern Area Health Board will shortly be undertaking a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on various health professionals recommended the establishment of a therapy assistant grade, where appropriate, to provide practical support to speech and language therapists in their work and also to address the issue of skills mix raised by the Deputy. This recommendation will be progressed in 2002, the context of the continuing implementation of the expert group report.</P>
      <P>My Department has asked the chief executive officer of each health board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy in relation to the number of vacancies for speech and language therapists and a reply will issue to the Deputy from the Department as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Since this Government came into power, a number of major policy initiatives underpinned by the most significant programme of investment in the health services have been launched that reflect the reorientation and reshaping of the health services so as to improve people's health and quality of life. These initiatives cover a wide range of health and personal social services, from organisational reform through the establishment of the ERHA in March 2000, the Social Services Inspectorate in April 1999 and the Office of Tobacco Control in July 1999 through to the launching of major national strategies, such as the cardiovascular strategy, the health promotion strategy and the national children's strategy and, of course culminating in the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You late last year.</P>
      <P>This year, over &euro;8 billion is being invested in the health services which represents an overall increase for the health services since 1997 of 125%. Currently, there are in the region of 85,000 people working in the health services as against 67,000 in 1997.

This figure represents a decrease of 5,907 or 18% on the comparable figure for September 1997. During the period September 2000 to September 2001, the number waiting for cardiac surgery was down by 61%, the number waiting for ENT procedures was down by 30% and the number waiting for gynaecology procedures was down by 28%. Dedicated funding of &euro;138 million was made available to health agencies between 1997 and 2001 to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures. A further &euro;43.48 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2002. Provisional figures for 2001 indicate that some 920,000 patients were dis<Col N="629" /> charged following treatment in public hospitals, an increase of nearly 50,000 over 2000.</P>
    <P>The new health strategy includes a plan covering the actions required to address the issue of waiting lists and particularly waiting times. The targets set out in the strategy are that by the end of 2002 no adult will wait longer than 12 months and no child will wait longer than six months for treatment, by the end of 2003 no adult will wait longer than six months and no child will wait longer than three months for treatment and by the end of 2004 no public patients will wait longer than three months for treatment. A new dedicated treatment purchase fund will be used for the purpose of purchasing treatments for public patients, either from private hospitals in Ireland or, if necessary, from abroad.</P>
    <P>The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context, a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. This is the first phase of the provision of an additional 3,000 acute beds over the period to 2011, as announced in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The health strategy acknowledges the central role of primary care in the future development of the health services. A major refocus on primary care services is marked by the introduction of a new model of primary care involving a core inter-disciplinary primary care team, which will work with a wider network of health and social care professionals and will offer 24 hour cover. In addition, the ongoing establishment of 24 hour GP co-operatives as part of the strengthening of primary care will help to reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise have to attend at an A&amp;E department.</P>
    <P>Other improvements that can be seen across the health services are: for intellectual disability and autism services, additional funding in 2001 of &euro;48 million revenue was allocated, followed by &euro;38 million in January 2002; between 2000 and 2001, additional revenue and capital funding has provided around 840 new residential places, 296 new respite places and over 1,500 new day places, in addition to the enhancement of other services; and for physical and sensory disability services, funding, capital and non-capital, allocated for the period mid-1997-2002 is over &euro;175 million.</P>
    <P>Additional developments in the period 1997 to 2001 include: an additional 51 long-term residential places; an additional 95 residential respite <Col N="630" /> places; 400 new day care places; 54 additional occupational therapy posts; an additional 37 speech and language therapy posts; and an additional 33 physiotherapy posts.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from &euro;12.7 million in 1997 to an additional &euro;72.9 million in 2001, including nursing home subvention funding. The total additional funding between 1997 and 2001 has been &euro;168 million and has resulted in over 1300 additional staff being approved for services for older people. From 1998 to 2001 over 550 additional beds have been provided in new community nursing units and over 1,250 day places per week have been provided in new day care centres. Additional funding of &euro;87.8 million is being made available in 2002 for further development of the services.</P>
    <P>This Government has allocated over &euro;103 million to date to cancer services. Since 1997, 64 additional consultant posts have been created together with support staff. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of this year of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. This plan will be developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The ongoing programme of strategic reforms across all sectors of the health services that is backed by unprecedented levels of investment has delivered and is continuing to deliver major improvements in the services throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>A birth certificate is a certified copy of an entry in the register of births. There is a statutory obligation on parents to register the birth of a child and a birth may only be registered in the district in which it occurred. Where it is established that a birth has not been previously registered, it is possible to effect registration provided the information, required by law to be registered, is available, particularly information in relation to the date and place of birth. The authority of An tArd Chláraitheoir is required for the registration of a birth, where more than 12 months has elapsed, since the date of birth. A statutory declaration setting out the particulars to be registered is required and, in addition, An tArd Chláraitheoir will seek some independent confirmation of details, as set out in the declaration.</P>
      <P>An tArd Chláraitheoir has not been able to locate a particular application for the late registration of a birth matching the details provided by the Deputy. However he understands that there was an inquiry with his office in recent months from a person who lacked certain of the basic information necessary to register a birth and this call may relate to the Deputy's question. The above mentioned requirements for the late registration of the birth were explained to the person concerned.</P>

The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 93. Included in this figure is the 24 place purpose built special care unit at Ballydowd in the eastern region which is being opened on a phased basis. An additional 41 places are due to become available by mid 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" />The South Western Area Health Board has operational responsibility for the Ballydowd special care unit which caters for young people with serious emotional and behavioural problems who are placed there by order of the High Court. There are currently seven young people in Ballydowd who have been referred there following an assessment of suitability for the centre. The board provides a wide range of therapy and specialist services in the centre as well as a comprehensive GP service and full-time education programme. The young people in question have very special needs and often their behaviour can be extreme and can include assaults on staff. This is not unusual given the emotional and behavioural difficulties the young people have. To address this the health board has an ongoing training programme for staff which assists them in managing these difficult situations. The health board also provides training for staff in child development and in working with young people who have experienced trauma.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, staff at Ballydowd special care unit, represented by SIPTU and IMPACT, took limited 24 hour industrial action recently on staffing issues. The SWAHB has been in ongoing discussions with the trade unions and a number of initiatives have been undertaken by the board to address the main issues of concern. These include the appointment of very experienced senior staff members from the eastern region, with considerable experience in residential child care. There is also an ongoing staff recruitment campaign in Ireland and abroad. The board has also commenced a review of staff training needs with a view to implementing training as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Social Services Inspectorate carried out an inspection of Ballydowd special care unit last July, which was very positive in relation to the management and running of the centre and the quality of care provided to the young people. The inspectorate also highlighted a small number of other issues which it felt needed to be addressed. These issues have been or are in the process of being addressed. I should add that as Ballydowd is a special care unit it is subject to annual inspection by the Social Services Inspectorate. The next inspection of the unit by the inspectorate is scheduled for later this month.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a request for financial clearance for the appointment of two consultant respiratory physicians for the Cork area. One request is from the Mercy Hospital and the second is from the Southern Health Board. Both applications will have to be considered by the Southern Health Board and the two Cork voluntary hospitals in the context of the development of the existing respiratory service for the region. The board will also need to consider the priority of these posts in the context of other competing demands on available resources particularly in the light of the revised funding arrangements for the Cork voluntary hospitals which commenced in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the report of the top level steering group on acute hospital services in Cork, which was published last year, proposed a new model for the funding, planning and management of hospital services in Cork city, involving the transfer of funding responsibility for the Cork voluntary hospitals from my Department to the Southern Health Board with effect from this year.</P>
      <P>There is a need to take an overall view of development requirements in respect of Cork acute hospital services particularly given the intention to provide a single service from multiple sites. Arising from the recommendations of the top level steering group an acute hospitals planning forum has been established as a vital and necessary step to create a climate for future collaborative and integrated development of hospital services in Cork. All the significant stake holders are represented on the Acute Hospitals Planning Forum. The first remit of the forum will be to draft a comprehensive strategic plan for the acute hospital services in Cork city. The development and future role of the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital will be central to that strategic plan.</P>
      <P>In the context of the national review of bed capacity, I recently announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. An amount of &euro;2.8 million is being made available to the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital to provide 18 additional acute beds in 2002. Eight additional beds will be for cardiology services at the hospital and ten additional beds will be provided to deal with the increasing demand for day care services in the area of medicine and surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also providing funding for the purchase of property adjacent to the hospital. <Col N="637" /> This property will increase the hospital site and allow the hospital to consider future development options. In this regard, my Department has asked the chief executive officer at the South Infirmary &ndash; Victoria Hospital to write directly to the Deputy in relation to the future development of services at the hospital.</P>

      <P>Some 320 new residential places for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism were provided in 1999, 422 in 2000 and, while the figures for 2001 are being finalised, it would appear that between 395 and 400 new places will have been provided during that year.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding provided in 2002 for the development of new services is &euro;25 million which will provide for more than 100 new residential places, together with additional day, respite and other support services. I presume the out of home cases referred to by the Deputy relate to crisis admissions to the residential services. In recent years the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority have been asked to put in place mechanisms to assist service providers with the costs associated with such admissions. Details of the numbers of such cases would not routinely be sought by my Department during the year, but would be dealt with in the final returns by the boards at the end of the year. In relation to the question of how the new residential places should be allocated, it is a matter for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine the manner in which the funding available to them is used to meet the needs of the various categories of persons requiring services.</P>

      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. This list ensures equity between the general medical ser<Col N="638" /> vices and drug payment schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified.</P>
      <P>For any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with a published list of criteria. These range from their authorisation status where appropriate, their price and in certain cases the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.</P>
      <P>The product referred to is one of a group of products which were deleted in 1982 on the basis of their availability without a prescription and their relatively low cost. The person's general practitioner would be in the best position to recommend a suitable alternative.</P>

      <P>One indicator of the number of heroin users is the number seeking treatment. The number of people receiving treatment by community care area is not available. However, at the end of December 2001, there were 5,695 people receiving methadone maintenance treatment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area &ndash; 2,013 in the Northern Area Health Board, 2,233 in the South Western Area Health Board, 710 in the East Coast Area Health Board, 510 in Trinity Court, Pearse Street, and 229 in prisons.</P>
      <P>The National Advisory Committee on Drugs has approved a number of studies aimed at providing reliable national and regional statistics on the nature and extent of drug misuse which will give a clearer picture of the drug problem.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive statutory assessments of local authority housing needs are carried out on a triennial basis. The results of the most recent assessment of housing needs which was undertaken by local authorities in March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. The previous statutory assessments of housing needs undertaken in March 1993 and March 1996 indicated a total of 28,624 and 27,427 households, respectively, in need of local authority housing. A detailed breakdown by local authority of the results of these assessments are published in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletins for the September quarters in 1993, 1996 and 1999 and are available in the Oireachtas Library. The next comprehensive assessment of housing need is due to be undertaken by local authorities at the end of this month.</P>

      <P>The Glenties sewerage scheme was 20th on the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Donegal County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of these assessments. These priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water <Col N="642" /> services investment programme 2000-02, announced in July 2000. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it has been possible to include the scheme in the programme.</P>

      <P>The current Mayo county development plan was adopted in 1992. In late 1997, Mayo County Council applied to my Department for an extension of the period to complete the review of the 1992 county plan to 30 June 1999. This request was not granted as the council did not provide my Department with a realistic timetable for the expected completion of the review. It was agreed that the council would submit a further request for an extension to the review period once the draft plan was prepared and ready to be put on display.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New provisions governing the making of development plans, set out in Part II of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, came into operation on 1 January 2001. The new Act sets out strict deadlines for the making of development plans and does not provide for the grant of exten<Col N="644" /> sions of time. Section 266 of the 2000 Act provides that development plans made under the earlier legislation shall continue in force. Where, on commencement of the 2000 Act provisions, a plan is in force for longer than four years, the planning authority must within one year of commencement initiate the procedure for making a new plan. In this case, Mayo County Council gave notice in December 2001 of its intention to review its existing development plan and to prepare a new plan for its area under section 11 of the 2000 Act. This review must be completed and a new development plan adopted by December 2003.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 393 to 395, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads stipulates that where the full road grant is unlikely to be expended by 30 September in the year of allocation, the Department should be notified as soon as possible and informed of the estimated shortfall. Any savings so advised will be reallocated at the Department's discretion to other eligible projects already put forward by the authority concerned or by another local authority, where the amount involved can be expended in the current year. While efforts <Col N="648" /> will be made to compensate in subsequent years' allocations for any shortfall which may arise in any year for improvement schemes, no guarantee can be offered in this regard.</P>
    <P>In 2001, my Department received one application from Laois County Council dated 1 November 2001 to make a number of transfers of EU co-financed specific improvement grants amounting to &euro;77,448, £60,995. This application was approved by my Department on 9 November 2001.</P>

      <P>Information in relation to the average price of new houses is provided in my Department's quarterly housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The Government has implemented a wide range of measures to reduce excessive house price increases by boosting housing output, removing infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development and discouraging speculative demand. These have included: extensive measures to increase housing supply including the introduction for the first time ever of a greatly expanded four year multi-annual local authority housing programme and the unprecedented expansion of the voluntary housing programme; increasing the supply of serviced residential land through targeted initiatives and the commitment of significant Exchequer funding &ndash; on foot of these initiatives, there is currently six years supply of serviced residential land nationally and in the greater Dublin area; securing the more efficient use of serviced housing land through higher residential densities; introduction of a range of measures to expand the capacity of the planning system, including the appointment of additional planning staff to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála significantly improving the eligibility criteria under both the shared ownership and the affordable housing schemes, and introducing innovative legislation through Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, to increase the supply of affordable housing going forward; the removal, in April 1998, of mortgage interest relief for investment in the residential housing market and the introduction of higher rates of stamp duty on such investments with the aim of discouraging speculative demand; and the rebalancing of stamp duty rates to favour first time purchasers including increasing the exemption limit from &euro;76,184 in 1997 to &euro;190,500 currently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" />These measures have had a very positive effect in moderating house price increases and significantly increasing housing output. Average year on year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to about 5% to 6% in the September quarter last year compared to the September quarter 2000: this has allowed the Government to reintroduce mortgage interest relief for investors and adjust stamp duty rates for investors in budget 2002.</P>
    <P>Last year was also the fifth successive year of record housing output since the Government took office. A total of 52,602 units were completed in 2001, up 5.6% on 2000. A total of 16,498 units were completed in the greater Dublin area, up 6% on 2000, and the highest level of output ever produced in the greater Dublin area. Local authority housing output of over 5,000 units was at the highest level in 15 years and voluntary housing output of some 1,250 units was the highest level ever recorded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 159 of 28 February 2002 which outlines investment and other initiatives by my Department with the objective of eliminating pollution of waterways.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, as statutory pollution control authorities, have a key role in protecting water resources and avail of an extensive range of powers to give effect to their responsibilities in this area. While my Department does not initiative prosecutions in relation to water pollution control, the following is a summary of relevant enforcement activity by local authorities, under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, in 1999 which is the most recent year for which this information is available to my Department:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 4,227 cases were investigated as to entry of polluting matter to waters and 3,236 advice or warnings issued: the corresponding figures for 1998 were 3,975 and 3,448 respectively. Some 1,681 cases were investigated as to discharges of trade and sewage effluent discharges to waters and 681 advice or warnings issued: the corresponding figures for 1998 were 1,088 and 301 respectively. Some 493 cases were investigated as to discharges to sewers without a licence or breaches of conditions of a licence and 314 advice or warnings issued: the corresponding figures for 1998 were 1,498 investigations and 988 advice or warnings. Some 1,131 section 12 notices were <Col N="651" /> issued in 1999, including 1,072 in respect of agricultural activities: this compares with 1,313 notices issued in 1998, of which 1,193 related to agriculture. These notices require measures to be taken to prevent or deal with water pollution.</P>
    <P>Measures were taken directly by local authorities in 74 instances to protect water quality or to remedy the effects of pollution. Some 47 prosecutions were taken and 24 convictions were recorded in 1999: this compares with 49 prosecutions taken and 27 convictions in 1998. Information in respect of prosecutions taken by local authorities for the years requested, in so far as it is available in my Department, is set out in the following tabular statement. More detailed information on local authority water pollution control activities is also available in my Department's quarterly environment bulletin which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Statistics on water pollution control activities by local authorities for the years 2000 and 2001 are not yet available in my Department.</P>

      <P>Under section 59 of the 1996 Act, each local authority is responsible for the supervision, and the enforcement, of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area.

I have recently received a report on the matter, and without prejudice to the legal position outlined above, when I have fully considered that report, I will determine a suitable course of action, including if appropriate the forwarding of all relevant papers.</P>

      <P>The standard speed limit for built-up urban areas is currently 30 miles per hour. However, there is a general obligation that a vehicle shall not be driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable its driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear.</P>
      <P>The present framework for speed limits derives from a comprehensive review carried out between 1990 and 1992 and was further addressed in the context of the Government strategy for road safety 1998-1992. The strategy concluded that changes should not be proposed in the immediate term and that the priority was to secure a much higher level of compliance with the existing speed limits.</P>
      <P>The merits of a revision of speed limits, including reduced speed limits in urban areas, will be considered in the light of experience under the road safety strategy 1998-2002 and in the context of preparations of the next road safety strategy.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied to my Department for a fuel allowance in January 2002. The investigation of his claim showed that the person concerned resides with his brother who is not in receipt of a social welfare payment and therefore is not one of the excepted categories of people for fuel allowance scheme purposes. The person concerned was informed, in error, that the grounds for disallowing his claim was that he had access to his own supply of fuel. This error is regretted.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply to the Deputy's previous Parliamentary Question in this case, however, the reason for the disallowance was that the person concerned did not satisfy the household conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413 and 420 together.</P>
      <P>The employment status of share fishermen for social insurance purposes has been considered by the High Court, hearing two appeals on a question of law under section 271 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1993, against a determination of the chief appeals officer of the social welfare appeals office. A judgment in this matter was delivered on 2 October last.</P>
      <P>The High Court held that share fishermen who offer their services to boat owners and skippers in the manner which is customary in the industry do so as self-employed co-venturers or partners with boat owners or skippers and are not employed under a contract of service.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, share fishermen whose circumstances are similar to those of the cases considered by the High Court are insurable under Class S as self-employed persons. However, they may enhance their PRSI cover by availing of an optional scheme of social insurance, Class P, which was introduced in 1994. This scheme gives share fishermen the option, on the payment of an additional contribution, of enhancing their social insurance cover over and above that available to other self-employed persons. Payment of the additional contribution provides limited cover for disability benefit and unemployment benefit as well as full cover for treatment benefits.</P>
      <P>Regarding the potential for amending the legislation to bring share fishermen back into Class A, a number of efforts have been made over the years to do this, but on each occasion the legislation has been successfully challenged in the courts. Essentially, the problem is that Class A social insurance is based on there being an employer/employee relationship, with both employer and employee making contributions and the employee being eligible for benefits. In view of the court rulings to date, it is not considered possible to legislate to apply Class A social insurance to cases where an employer-employee relationship does not exist.</P>

      <P>The various free schemes operated by the Department are designed to support pensioners, certain disabled people and carers living on their own. Persons resident in nursing homes are not considered to be living on their own for the purposes of these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" />When the &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; requirement applying to these schemes was removed in May 2001 for those aged over 70, a small number of applications for telephone allowance from residents of nursing homes who had their own private telephone lines were approved in error.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the telephone allowance to pensioners in nursing homes would involve a change in the basis of the scheme and would have cost implications. Any such development would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>if it is open to a self-employed person, whose income from 1988 to 1992 was less than the £2,500 level which conferred a liability for compulsory insurance at Class S, to now pay five years of voluntary contributions in order to qualify for old age pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>To be admitted as a voluntary contributor, a person must have at least 156 weeks PRSI paid under compulsory insurance &ndash; 260 from April 2002 &ndash; in either employment or self-employment. In addition, the person must apply to become a voluntary contributor within 12 months after the end of the contribution year during which they last paid compulsory insurance or during which they were last awarded a credited contribution  &ndash;&ldquo;credit&rdquo;. Also, the person must agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week after the week in which they cease compulsory insurance.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for a person who reaches pension age without sufficient contributions to retrospectively pay voluntary contributions in order to qualify for a pension at that stage. I have already acknowledged the difficulties of self-employed people who, because of their age when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced in 1988, would have been excluded from pensions because of the rule which requires that a person have started to pay social insurance at least ten years before they reach pension age.</P>
      <P>To address these problems, in April 1999 I introduced a special old age (contributory) pension for those self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have at least five years contributions paid since then. Payment is at a flat rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increase for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>
      <P>The rationale behind this five-year paid contribution condition is to ensure that entitlement to a pension is limited to those who have made some reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" />I consider these arrangements to be a fair and sympathetic response to the predicament of some people who, through no fault of their own, could not qualify for a pension in accordance with the standard qualifying rate.</P>

      <P>The means test for the one-parent family payment is designed to encourage those in receipt of the payment to maximise their income from all sources, including employment and maintenance payments.</P>
      <P>In relation to employment lone parents may earn up to &euro;146.50 per week without affecting their payment with earnings over this limit counted at 50% up to a maximum of &euro;293.02 per week. The earnings disregard is designed to recognise the particular difficulties and expenses which a lone parent may face in taking up employment and training opportunities and to encourage them to consider employment as an alternative to long-term welfare dependency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to maintenance, the objective is to encourage lone parents to pursue the question of payments with the other parent and to ensure that the other parent has an incentive to contribute. This is achieved by ensuring that there is a clear benefit to lone parents and their children arising from any maintenance payments secured. When the scheme was introduced in 1997 up to &euro;95 of maintenance paid in respect of housing costs was disregarded. However, arising from the review of the one-parent family payment, published in 2000, further concessions were intro<Col N="661" /> duced which provide for up to 50% of maintenance received to be disregarded.</P>
    <P>The allowances for maintenance payments made in the means test are intended to support the particular policy objectives outlined. Making a general allowance in the means test for rent or mortgage payments would not be in keeping with this policy.</P>
    <P>Those who have difficulty with housing costs are, of course, eligible to apply for rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. Some &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002.</P>
      <P>Funding payable under all schemes and programmes operated by my Department is subject to compliance with the defined selection and eligibility criteria for these schemes and programmes. While I appreciate that some older people may be reluctant to divulge PPSN &ndash; formally RSI number &ndash; or pension numbers, in order to administer this and other grant schemes which are funded from public money, the Department must ensure that all criteria are adhered to. It is a condition of the scheme that individuals must be aged 65 and over and the PPS number provides the mechanism for verifying that all proposed beneficiaries satisfy this eligibility criteria.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy and voluntary groups participating in the scheme, that all applications received in my Department and the information contained therein, are regarded with the utmost confidentiality and is required for above administrative purposes only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme of community support for older people the maximum grant available is 90% of the once-off costs of purchasing and installing the necessary security equipment. However, the actual level of funding made available for individual applications varies according to individual <Col N="662" /> needs and circumstances and according to the overall demand to be met in relation to the available resources. It is necessary to assess all applications at the same time so that an appropriate level of funding can be determined for each application, taking into account the need to target funding at those most in need of assistance under the scheme. In order to facilitate this process it is necessary to have one closing date for receipt of applications so that an accurate assessment of the total number of applications received and the level of funding sought can be made.</P>
    <P>I consider that this process, which diminishes the administrative responsibilities of voluntary organisations, actually supports the voluntary sector whom I acknowledge work tirelessly in the communities to improve the social support of the most vulnerable older people and to promote the benefits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, while a closing date for receipt of applications is applied each year, the regional offices of my Department are flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. The carer's allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring.

    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has been directly involved in <Col N="668" /> activities to combat moneylending since the publication in 1988 of a report by the Combat Poverty Agency entitled Moneylending and Low Income Families. The 1992 budget provided &euro;330,200 for the establishment of five pilot projects around the country, aimed at building new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending and over-indebtedness. The budget, for what has become the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, has grown from &euro;330,200 in 1992 &ndash; five pilot projects &ndash; to &euro;9,702,000 in 2002 &ndash; 52 projects.</P>
    <P>MABS provides money advice for local communities, including the publication of information on money management and debt counselling; it is targeted primarily at individuals and families who have problems with debt or moneylending and who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare; and it assists its clients in accessing sources of low cost credit through credit unions.</P>

    <P>My Department has also funded a number of once-off grant schemes under the community development support programme which concentrate on the provision of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work. The once-off grant schemes currently available are as follows&ndash;</P>
    <P>Scheme of grants to voluntary organisations: these grants are made for renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment or transport, once-off publications or research or other special projects.</P>
    <P>Community development education and training grants scheme: the purpose of this scheme is to fund local community and voluntary groups for funding and education initiatives. For example, programmes which strengthen and increase the skills and knowledge of management committees.</P>
    <P>Scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups: grants are provided for programmes of self help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life. Applications under these schemes were advertised in the national press on 14 January 2002 with a closing date of 22 February 2002.</P>
    <P>Scheme of community support for older people: the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has, since 1996, operated the <Col N="669" /> scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.</P>
    <P>Community development support programmes: my Department also operates a number of long-term funding programmes which are collectively referred to as the community development support programme. It includes the community development programme, the family and community services resource centre programme and the programme of core funding to locally based community and family support groups. The purpose of these programmes is to provide seed money to enable locally based community groups to pilot initiatives in relation to poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The programmes are concerned with promoting positive change in society in favour of those who benefit least from economic development and are focused primarily on enhancing the capacity of those experiencing poverty and disadvantage to participate more effectively in society.</P>
    <P>The Family Mediation Service provides a professional and confidential service for couples who have decided to separate, or who have already separated, to negotiate their own separation agreement. The service is free and available at 11 locations nation-wide. The FMS is an integral part of my Department.</P>
    <P>Details of the projects funded under the schemes indicated above have been made available to the Dáil Library each year, from their commencement to the year 2000, for the information of members.

      <P>The estimated cost of reducing the qualifying age for old age non-contributory pension to 64 years is &euro;92 million per annum. Any reduction in the qualifying age for the old age non-contributory pension would also have implications for the old age contributory and retirement pension schemes. Reducing the qualifying age for these schemes would cost approximately &euro;240 million per annum.</P>
      <P>In considering proposals for reducing pension age generally a number of issues need to be considered including the additional costs involved, the projections for the ageing of our population, improved life expectancy, the sustainability of our pension systems and EU policy in this area which seeks to improve the workforce participation of older people as a way of dealing with the sustainability issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 436 and 438 together.</P>
      <P>Public policy has increasingly recognised that there are spatial concentrations of unemployment, poverty and exclusion where individuals, families and communities suffer a form of cumulative disadvantage. Such problems can best be addressed by targeted and integrated policy responses. This understanding has informed, Building an Inclusive Society, the review of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, recently launched by the Taoiseach and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key elements of the revised NAPS is that the new national office for social inclusion will be supported in the development of a comprehensive data strategy by a technical advisory group, which will include specialists in data collection and research. Part of the focus of the data <Col N="671" /> strategy, and an associated research programme, will be on the spatial dimensions of poverty, under the key NAPS themes of urban disadvantage and rural poverty. As this process moves forward, the issue of how the data, research and learning gained can become a resource for all actors in the social inclusion arena will be considered, with a view to making the targeting of resources and areas of deprivation more effective.</P>
    <P>Building an Inclusive Society enhances our focus on urban disadvantage and rural poverty through the setting of specific key targets for these themes. The targets seek to build upon the progress made in tackling spatial disadvantage over the lifetime of this Government. Central to this will be the county and city strategies for social, economic and cultural development currently being drawn up by county and city development boards. These strategies will have a strong focus on the achievement of greater social inclusion within their areas. The RAPID and CLÁR programmes, the establishment of pilot social inclusion units in nine local authorities and the ongoing roll-out of the national anti-poverty strategy to local level will greatly assist in delivering on this objective.</P>
    <P>At regional level, two regional monitoring committees have been established to oversee the delivery of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan, to monitor progress in development generally in the BMW and South and East regions, and to focus on the reduction of poverty and social exclusion within the two regions. My Department, in co-operation with the Combat Poverty Agency, is engaged with the regional operational programmes in developing a pilot project aimed at improving the assessment of the impact of the programmes on social inclusion.</P>

      <Quest>the numbers availing of the students summer jobs scheme in each of the past three years; the way in which these figures compare with the number of positions available on those schemes, in view of the shortfall of students who qualify for those jobs; if all students studying at third level should be eligible; if he will extend the criteria to include students who have just completed the leaving certificate; and if he will reduce the number of hours from 200 to 150 or increase the payment taking inflation into account.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the students summer jobs scheme is to provide financial help to less well off third level students who do not have access to unemployment payments during the summer. The scheme allows <Col N="672" /> students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work.</P>
      <P>A total of 9,200 students availed of the scheme in 1999, 5,883 in 2000 and 4,965 in 2001. The number of projects made available by sponsors for each of those three years was 23,473, 20,961 and 15,233 respectively.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to open up the scheme to all third level students or to those who have just completed their leaving certificate. Resources should be channelled where the need is greatest and the focus of the scheme must remain on providing less well off students with an income, rather than filling all the jobs offered by sponsors.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I do not intend to change the number of hours which can be worked under the scheme or the rate of pay per hour. The scheme is not intended to compete with jobs available on the open labour market. The diversion of such an employable group of workers from commercial employment could have a very negative impact on many seasonal industries, such as the tourism industry, which is dependent on student participation.</P>
      <P>The decline in student interest in the scheme in recent years is due to the wider availability of summer jobs and is a very encouraging trend. It is obviously better for students to obtain work in the open labour market during the summer months, than to have to rely on support from the State.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider extending the back to work allowance provisions to the spouse of a qualifying person in the same way as the spouse of a qualifying person can take up community employment; and the estimated cost involved.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was introduced in September 1993 as part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to assist the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force. Since then almost 80,000 people have availed of the scheme to take up new jobs as either employees or self employed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Qualified adult dependants of customers in receipt of qualifying payments may also participate on the back to work allowance scheme. There are two ways in which this can be achieved. First, it is open to the qualified adult dependant to claim the relevant social welfare payment in his or her own right. If independent entitlement is established by the adult dependant he or she can then qualify for back to work allowance in his or her own right. The amount of the back to <Col N="673" /> work allowance in such circumstances will be based on the rate of the individual entitlement.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances the original claimant can also avail of the back to work allowance based on his or her revised entitlement. Alternatively, a qualified spouse can receive the back to work allowance where the claimant transfers his or her entitlement to the qualified spouse. The claimant, in these circumstances, is advised to sign for unemployment credits in order to protect future social insurance entitlements. The qualified adult is now regarded as the recipient of the social welfare payment and therefore entitled to the back to work allowance.</P>
    <P>Participants in the scheme also retain a wide range of secondary benefits, such as medical cards, while working under the scheme. Participants also have their new income from employment or self-employment so that there is a significant increase in the overall household income. I am satisfied that the existing arrangements to enable adult dependants of qualified customers access to the back to work allowance scheme provided a good incentive to persons in this category who may wish to avail of this option.</P>

      <P>My Department places great importance on reducing the hardship and financial worries which sudden loss of income by bereavement can cause. In addition to the widow's-widower's contributory and non-contributory pension schemes, a bereavement grant, a widowed parent grant, and after death payments are also available.</P>
      <P>Information about these and other matters is available from my Department's extensive network of 58 local offices and 68 branch offices throughout the country. A full-time information officer is available for sensitive discussions in most local offices. My Department publishes a range of information leaflets, including benefits for widows and widowers, and these are available from post offices as well as from the Department's offices. We also maintain a website www.welfare.ie where up-to-date information on all social welfare issues is available and where email enquiries can be processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle, funded by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is the national support agency responsible for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy to members of the public who use social services. Comhairle maintains a network of 85 citizen information centres throughout the country and provides a fully comprehensive and inte<Col N="674" /> grated information dissemination service. Comhairle also publishes a wide range of books and leaflets and these include information for people who are widowed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Comhairle maintains the Oasis website, www.oasis.gov.ie which provides a full range of information on social welfare entitlements, as well as details on a range of related issues. The information available on the Oasis website is specifically designed to address particular life cycle events such as bereavement.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has initiated the REACH project. This is a cross-departmental unit established to provide a more integrated public service to customers from the various public service agencies. When completed, REACH will offer a common access point for citizens and a single delivery point for agencies. Essentially, it will be a customer centred one-stop-shop for all state services.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that Revenue staff receive extensive customer training and fully appreciate the sensitivities of dealing with taxpayers who are recently bereaved. The Revenue website, www.revenue.ie, gives details of the taxation implications of various life cycle events, one of which is bereavement.</P>
    <P>My Department has continuously sought ways to enhance our delivery of services to our customers. We realise that the information needs of the public, including those recently widowed, must be met simply and efficiently. We are also aware that the information needs of our customers are continuously evolving and changing. To this end we will continue to meet these needs as efficiently and comprehensively as possible.</P>

    </P>
    <P>The 2002 scheme of grants will be advertised extensively in the national and provincial newspapers in the near future.</P>
    <P>However, while a closing date for receipt of applications is applied each year, the regional offices of my Department are flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>
    <P>While every effort is made to ensure the prompt processing of applications, failure to submit the necessary documentation or satisfactory accounts will invariably delay the processing of these applications. In administering this and other grant schemes, my Department must ensure that all criteria are adhered to, including the provision by funded groups of satisfactory accounts in respect of previous grants. Applications are processed as quickly as possible by my Department once all the necessary documentation has been received.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, grants for the following equipment are provided for: small-scale physical security equipment such as, strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and door locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarms systems, such as the 'panic button' pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated via the telephone.</P>
    <P>To be eligible for grant aid under the scheme, individuals must be aged 65 and over and either living alone; or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older people and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and are unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves.</P>
    <P>As it is a condition of the scheme that individuals must be aged 65 and over it is necessary to provide details of age and PPS number, formally RSI number, in order to verify that all proposed beneficiaries satisfy this eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that all applications received in my Department and the information contained therein, is regarded with the utmost confidentiality and is required for above administrative purposes only.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" />Each organisation who applies for funding must provide the name, address and date of birth for each individual to be assisted under the scheme and state the type and cost of the equipment required for each individual.</P>
    <P>Inevitably between the time the list is submitted to my Department and a recommendation is made, there may be some variation between the original list of beneficiaries and the final list due to unforeseen circumstances.</P>
    <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover 50% of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment but grants of up to 90% maybe made where the circumstances so warrant.</P>
    <P>Any voluntary or community based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may apply for grant aid. Individual people who wish to obtain information on how they, or older people known to them, can obtain assistance under this scheme should contact their local representative of any of the organisations involved in the scheme, such as, Muintir na Tire, Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, or any other group involved in the scheme in their local area.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy, in relation to the works on the Royal Canal aimed at re-opening the waterway from Dublin to the River Shannon is the day to day responsibility of Waterways Ireland, a North-South Implementation Body for inland waterways, set up under the British-Irish Agreement signed in March 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" />Waterways Ireland took over responsibility for the Royal Canal with effect from 1 April 2000 and is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterways system throughout Ireland, principally for recreational purposes.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal is open to navigation between Dublin and Abbeyshrule, County Longford, a distance of 70 miles. Work of the restoration of the remaining 20 miles is in progress. The outstanding works include the construction of seven road bridges to replace existing culverts, lockgate installation, reconstruction of bog embankments, the provision of additional water supplies as well as minor bank repairs.</P>
    <P>The works to remove one of the seven culverts commenced in December 2001 and is due to be completed in July 2002. Engineering consultants have been engaged to design replacement bridges for a further two culvert sites and consultants will be engaged shortly to design the remaining four bridges.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 some &euro;15 million in 1999 terms has been allocated to the Royal Canal restoration project. Waterways Ireland also inform me that while they still hope to complete this project on time and within budget, the escalating construction costs affecting the civil engineering industry may require a re-evaluation of the project to be undertaken in the near future.</P>

Officials of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, are currently investigating the matter to ascertain what payment, if any, is due to the person for losses arising from the 30% de-stocking in 2001. Once the matter has been clarified the person named will be contacted and any payment owing will issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan):</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of an islander allowance was first raised by my Department with the Department of Finance in November 1997 when it was proposed that the allowance would take the form of an island tax allowance for wage earners and an extra island allowance for social welfare recipients whose permanent place of residence was on offshore islands. The issue was later discussed within the framework of the interdepartmental committee on the islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware in this context that an extra &euro;12.70 per week for pensioners living on the islands was announced in budget 2000. I have also recently had discussions with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regarding the possible extension of this allowance.</P>

      <P>At present, my Department recoups Údarás na Gaeltachta for the cost incurred by it in providing an emergency helicopter service to Tory Island, County Donegal. This service is provided in conjunction with the North-Western Health Board on a fortnightly basis during the winter months for the use of the island community and to enable the health board to transport essential personnel to the island. I understand that the health board also transports its personnel to the island by helicopter during the summer months. Aside from this service, there are no regular subsidised helicopter services to other off-shore islands.</P>
      <P>Whenever the need for emergency helicopter flights to assist island communities is brought to the attention of my Department, every effort is made to secure through the Department of Defence, the assistance of the Air Corps whenever it is possible to do so. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that on some occasions they are not in a position to do so for operational reasons.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following tabular statement. The figures provided cover expenditure on capital projects by my <Col N="682" /> Department within the constituency of Cork north-west for each of the years 1995 to 2001, inclusive.</P>
      <P>In the case of capital works within the Gaeltacht area in County Cork, my Department operates a number of schemes under the Gaeltacht Acts, and the works can range from major improvement schemes to very minor roadworks. Given the diverse range and scale of the projects involved the overall capital expenditure within the constituency under each scheme is included.</P>
      <P>With regard to Údarás na Gaeltachta, the figures shown relate to expenditure on grants to industry, investment in companies and capital investment in industrial infrastructure in the years specified for all of the Cork Gaeltacht, including Oileán Chléire which is not in the constituency of Cork north-west.</P>

      <P>The issue raised is the day-to-day responsibility of the RTE authority and I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>In accordance with longstanding custom, I am prepared to furnish to the House information supplied by RTE in response to questions relating specifically to improvements in reception of national broadcasting services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" />RTE informs me that it carried out a detailed survey of the area in November 2001 which showed that the reception was very marginal. The provision of a community system could solve the problem but, due to cross-channel interference from Scottish Television on RTE's Moville transmitter, it was not possible to locate an adequate receiver signal suitable for re-transmission. RTE has informed me that it informed a residents' spokesperson about the situation in December 2001.   </P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I view the conservation management plans for special areas of conservation and special protected areas for birds, and the public consultation process in particular, as a central part of the system for informing the public and for maintaining the favourable conservation status of these sites in the long-term.</P>
      <P>Conservation management plans will not be finalised until after public consultations with landowners and all interested parties are completed. The objective of undertaking this process is to maximise the effectiveness of the plans and to ensure their full implementation.</P>
      <P>As at March 2002 there are 243 SAC plans and 98 SPA plans at various stages of completion. There is some overlap between the two as some SPAs are contained within SACs. Out of a total of 341 plans, 296 draft plans have reached the stage of being ready to progress to public consultation. Public consultation is already under way in the case of 24 of these plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initial public consultation is with local liaison committees representing landowners and users. When their views have been received a further draft is prepared which will be put on public dis<Col N="684" /> play for comments and observations from all interested parties. After public comments have been received a final version of the plan will be prepared and adopted.</P>
    <P>The following documents the progress of conservation management plan preparation for the SACs and SPAs involved.</P>
    <P>The methodology for preparation of management plans for SAC and SPA sites in Ireland was designed to include the following drafting phases: in progress means a contract is in place and work on the initial draft has commenced; Draft 0 &ndash; initial draft, work in progress; Draft 1 &ndash; version approved by Dúchas field staff; Draft 2 &ndash; version prepared following a meeting of the Dúchas plan review group, incorporating the views of Dúchas expert staff. This is the draft for public consultation and multiple copies are produced, bound with standardised covers for distribution and display to interested parties such as liaison committees and conservation organisations. Draft 3 &ndash; this is the version prepared following the completion of the public consultation process which will become the conservation management plan for the site in question for a five year period. Where appropriate aquaculture zones and national park management plans will be incorporated into these plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>To mark the 50th anniversary of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees hosted a meeting of State parties to the convention and its related 1967 Protocol in Geneva on 12 and 13 December 2001.</P>
      <P>The Government was represented at the meeting by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Mary Wallace. Other States were represented at the level of Minister, Minister of State or ambassador-permanent representative.</P>
      <P>This meeting was also part of the global consultations process on international protection which was launched by the UNHCR in late 2000 to consider the position of the 1951 Geneva Convention and international refugee protection generally at the beginning of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The global consultations have been organised along three parallel tracks. First, the continued recognition of the importance of the Geneva Convention in the context of international refugee protection. The December meeting was part of the first track process which sought to strengthen the commitment of State parties to the centrality of the convention in international refugee law.</P>
      <P>The second track comprises a series of meetings and expert round tables on various aspects of international protection involving participation by academics and other experts in this field.</P>
      <P>The third track of consultations is looking at protection policy matters aimed, <i>inter alia</i>, at the development of new approaches and standards for the strengthening of refugee protection. This has included discussions on issues such as the protection of refugees in mass influx situations, protection of refugees in the context of asylum systems having due regard to the asylum-immigration nexus, complimentary forms of protection and the strengthening of protection capacities in host countries.</P>
      <P>The December meeting of State parties took the form of statements by heads of delegations. Three round table discussions also took place which looked at the strengthening of the 1951 convention and related 1967 protocol, mass influx situations and upholding refugee protection in the face of contemporary challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister of State's statement to the meeting she reiterated Ireland's commitment to the principles and obligations set out in the convention. This has been demonstrated by the Government in a number of ways including the commencement in full of the Refugee Act, 1996; the establishment of two independent agencies to process asylum applications, namely, the Office <Col N="689" /> of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal; the allocation of significant additional resources including substantial extra staff to process asylum applications which has made significant inroads into the processing of applications on hand and new applications and also the speed at which such applications can be processed.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a situation where the ORAC is focusing primarily on 2001 applications; the allocation of significant additional resources for accommodation, healthcare, education and other reception support services for asylum seekers; and increased expenditure on legal aid services for asylum seekers, on interpretation services and on staff training which is carried out with the assistance of the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>The meeting also adopted a declaration reaffirming the commitment of State parties to the Geneva Convention. The declaration, <i>inter alia</i>, underlines the commitment of State parties to the importance of the 1951 Geneva Convention in the field of international protection including to its core principle of non-<i>refoulement</i>; takes note of the complex international environment in which the convention operates at present, including the high cost of hosting refugee populations and of maintaining asylum systems; notes the problems caused by trafficking and misuse of asylum systems; encourages States which have not done so to accede to the convention; reaffirms the central role of the UNHCR as the guardian of the convention; recognises the valuable role played by NGOs in the protection of refugees and asylum seekers; seeks better refugee protection through comprehensive strategies to assist developing countries and countries with large refugee populations. Durable solutions to the issue of refugee protection are also recommended such as voluntary repatriation, local integration and resettlement.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to have copies of the declaration placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <P>The visa applications in question have been refused because it was not established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicants would observe the conditions of a holiday visa.

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the particular playschool referred to by the Deputy, I have been informed by the child care directorate of my Department that funding of &euro;50,790, or £40,000, was approved in March 2001, towards the construction of a new child care facility under the capital grant scheme for private child care providers. The maximum value of the grant available under this scheme is set at 65% of the project costs, subject to an over<Col N="697" /> all ceiling of &euro;50,790 or £40,000 for each project. The project has already reached this limit. Therefore, it is not possible to increase the grant assistance to individual projects under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may not be aware that the Government introduced a capital tax allowance for premises used as child care facilities in budget 1999. This allows capital expenditure incurred to be written off against tax liabilities over a seven year period. An accelerated version of this scheme was introduced in budget 2000. This allows for such expenditure to be written off against tax liabilities in a one year period. Further information on this scheme is available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will know that I had proposals to act immediately in this area in terms of proposing constitutional amendment to be followed by legislation to establish a judicial council and ethics committee.

      <P>In 2001 as many as 1,427 applications for naturalisation were received in the immigration and citizenship division of my Department. This represented an increase of 42% <Col N="699" /> on the figure for 2000, which in turn represented an increase of 36% on the figure for 1999. The number of applications received so far in 2002 suggest that this upward trend is likely to continue.</P>
      <P>The number of applications for post-nuptial citizenship from persons resident in Ireland remained constant in 1999 and 2000, approximately 420 per year. In 2001 a total of 531 such applications were received. This represented an increase of 26% on the 1999 and 2000 figures. In addition, my Department is responsible for finalising over 800 applications annually for post-nuptial citizenship from persons resident outside the State.</P>
      <P>These increases in applications reflect the increase in demand for most other immigrant related services provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the foregoing increases, the average time taken to process applications for a certificate of naturalisation and post-nuptial citizenship is 15 months and six months respectively at present. The processing time for these applications has been reduced from two and a half years and 13 months respectively at the start of 2001. The average processing times for applications has been halved in 14 months against a background of ever increasing numbers of applications. This dramatic improvement has been brought about by a combination of the assignment of additional staff resources and the streamlining of procedures.</P>
      <P>Delays in the processing of citizenship applications often arise because applications are either incorrectly completed or incomplete despite comprehensive written instructions being included with application forms and the availability of a helpline in my Department.</P>

      <P>The person in question was originally granted permission to remain in the State until 27 February on the basis that she was the holder of a working holiday permit.

However, she was granted permission to remain as a visitor for a further one year period on 27 February.</P>

    <P>This type of permission to remain does not permit the holder to take up employment.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Mullingar has been considered by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate these applications.</P>
      <P>Following careful consideration of all the available information in relation to the application for Mullingar, the advisory committee formed the opinion that it did not meet the current criteria for the installation of a Garda CCTV system. Consequently it declined to recommend the installation of a CCTV system there at this point in time. Therefore, it is not proposed to install a CCTV system in Mullingar.</P>
      <P>The application will be kept under review. If the Deputy has any information that he wishes to put forward in support of the application he should send this to my Department and arrangements will be made to bring it to the attention of the advisory committee.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs. Assessment criteria include: crime-public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management and any special circumstances-needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on the area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems. This is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a CCTV system in an area.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid certain minimum standards must be met. The Garda must be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will play an important role. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised. Full details of the scheme, including rel<Col N="701" /> evant conditions and grant levels, will be announced soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my Department has been assigned the lead role in the development and co-ordination of childcare service provision over the course of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. My Department operates the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, the funding for which comes from both the European Union and the Exchequer. The Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006 funds childcare under three main strands, capital, staffing and <Col N="708" /> quality improvement. Applications for funding under the programme can be made to my Department's child care directorate. Completed applications are initially technically appraised, on behalf of my Department, by Area Development Management Limited. This is followed by an assessment by the Programme Appraisal Committee chaired by my Department before referral to me for final decision.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, child care is defined as:</P>
      <P>incorporating day care facilities and services for pre-school children and school going children out of school hours. It includes services offering care, education and socialisation opportunities for children to the benefit of children, parents, employers and the wider community. Thus services such as Naíonraí, daycare services, crèches, playgroups, childminding and after-school groups are included but schools (primary, secondary and special) and residential centres for children are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the focus of the funding under the programme is towards increasing the number of childcare facilities and places, improving the quality of childcare provision and enabling parents to access training, education or employment. Services which would be described as an intervention with a primary focus of health, education or social issues would not normally come within the remit of the programme. However, in the event that this group considers that they are providing a childcare service as defined under the programme, it is open to them to apply for grant assistance. Applications which meet the programme objectives are assessed according to the following five criteria: the socio economic profile of the area relating to the application; the quality <Col N="709" /> of the proposal; the capacity of the applicant/s to implement the project; the level of integration-co-ordination; and the costings-value for money of the proposal.</P>
    <P>The progress of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme is confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing childcare supply in Ireland. Since the announcement of the availability of funding in April 2000, I have committed funding in excess of &euro;95 million to over 1,000 child care projects on the ground, both in the community and private sector, under the capital and staffing strands of the programme. Almost 30,000 child care places are being supported by this funding which includes the creation of over 13,000 new child care places. The funding will also enable many of the services to extend their hours of operation and enhance the quality of the child care provided. In addition, I have approved funding of approximately &euro;15 million for quality improvement projects such as local child care networks, innovative projects, local child care training models, the Childminders Initiative and supports for the national voluntary childcare organisations. This brings the total amount allocated under the equal opportunities childcare programme to over &euro;111 million to date.</P>
    <P>The measures in place reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda and show that the Government is delivering on its commitment to treat childcare as a priority area for investment. I am satisfied that my Department is making this vital investment in an effective and strategic manner and that the equal opportunities child care programme of my Department is making a real difference to the families of Ireland. The strategies I have outlined, including both the funding measures and co-ordinating structures build on existing structures and will be further developed over the course of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the comments of the chairman of the Bar Council in relation to the need to penalise persons who knowingly make false or exaggerated claims for compensation, to include financial sanctions. There are, of course, already potential adverse consequences in these cases, such as the power which the court possesses in relation to the awarding of costs.</P>
      <P>The question of creating a specific criminal offence for a person to knowingly make a false or exaggerated claim is one which requires consideration of a number of factors. I could not say in response to a parliamentary question whether I intend to change the law as suggested. Any such decision could only be made following full consideration of all the issues involved and would, in the final analysis, be a matter for the Government to decide in the usual way.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Encounter was developed as the latest phase of its ongoing operational response to public order problems and incidents of street violence. Following on from the success of Operation Oíche, considerable information was available to the Garda Síochána on the times and locations of previous incidents.</P>
      <P>Using this information, the Garda authorities are now in a position to adapt a more focused approach to tacking this problem under Operation Encounter. Under the new operation, public order problems are being tackled at source. Nightclubs, licensed premises and fast food outlets are being particularly targeted at times when public order problems are most prevalent. Particular attention is also being paid to ensuring that the owners and managers of such premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out that additional resources have been made available for this operation, and each regional commander has been asked to draw <Col N="711" /> up their own plans to prioritise the deployment of resources.</P>

      <P>The person in question arrived in the State on 6 February 2000 and sought asylum. On examination by the asylum division, his case was deemed to be manifestly unfounded and he was notified of this decision on 23 October 2000. He appealed this decision and his appeal was refused by the refugee appeals authority. He was informed of this decision on 16 November 2000. The person in question was informed on 16 November 2000 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in his case. He was given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the Minister decides whether or not to order his deportation, or consenting to the making of a deportation order. An application for leave to remain was submitted by the person's legal representatives on 1 December 2000.</P>

      <P>The position is that the non-EU spouse of an EU national may apply to join their spouse in the State provided the EU national is himself or herself residing here in exercise of an EU treaty right. Such a non-EU national is required to register with their local Garda registration office and obtain permission to remain. In order to do so they will require a valid passport, a marriage certificate, evidence of their EU spouse's nationality, evidence that they are residing here with their EU spouse and evidence that their EU spouse is exercising an EU treaty right here &ndash; for example, letter of employment, enrolment details in a course of study etc. Unless the non-EU national is of a visa exempted category-nationality, they will also require a visa prior to entering the State and should apply for same at the relevant Irish embassy or consulate overseas or, in the absence of Irish representation, to the Department of Foreign Affairs visa office in Dublin. Their application should be accompanied by documentation along the lines of that set out above. Details of the categories of person exempted from the visa requirement are set out on my Department's website. Persons who are granted permission to remain in the State on this basis do not require a work permit in order to take up employment here, nor do they require business permission in order to operate a business in the State.</P>

      <P>The position is that an allocation of &euro;190,000 was made to Carlow in late 1999 under the Young people's facilities and services fund &ndash; YPFSF. In late 2000, the development group for the YPFSF in Carlow, which includes representation for the Carlow Regional Youth Services, made a submission to the national assessment committee, NAC, of the fund for the development of a central youth facility for the town and for advice on how best to progress the project. They were informed at that time that no additional funding would be available under the YPFSF at that time, outside of their original allocation. I subsequently met with representatives from Carlow Regional Youth Service in early 2001 to discuss their proposal.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should note that the development group made a further submission to the NAC in April 2001 seeking permission to use some of the funding allocated to them to develop the necessary plans to secure planning permission for their proposed youth facility. Following a meeting between representatives of the development group and the NAC in May 2001, this proposal was approved and the decision was communicated to the Carlow development group. I have had no further submission from the development group.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 517, 518 and 519, together.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following an initial submission and approval of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report stage, contract document stage, tender stage and construction stage. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Proposals have been received from Offaly County Council and Tullamore Urban District Council for the development of swimming facilities in Birr, Clara, Edenderry and Tullamore. My Department has asked the council with reference to the financial commitment which would be required from Offaly County Council in the event that all of these projects were to proceed simultaneously, to prioritise and if necessary review these applications in relation to the demand for local public swimming pools in the Offaly area. On receipt of a response from the county council these proposals will be considered further.</P>

      <P>To date &euro;36,017,157 has been expended on Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project, of which some &euro;30 million has been spent on the aquatic and leisure centre which is currently under construction and is due for completion to host the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A figure of &euro;48,662,000, IR£38,324,439, has been provided in the Estimates for my Department for 2002 which includes provision for the <Col N="716" /> construction costs in relation to the aquatic and leisure centre.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the overview of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project conducted by independent consultants HighPoint Rendel, HPR, the Government has requested me to report on the implications of the HPR recommendations and options and in particular to evaluate: the viability of the existing tendering strategy as a basis for any modification of the stadium design and operation; the implications for the Exchequer of the options and recommendations; the issues raised in paragraph 1.7 of the report; I propose to circulate a copy of this with the official report.</P>
    <P>I have initiated a process for the consideration of these issues. I will be drawing on a wide area of expertise and advice so that a thorough evaluation of the recommendations is made to ensure that Government is in a position to reach the best and most appropriate decision on the future of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland. Until I have completed this evaluation and reported to Government it would be premature to make any statement on the future plans for this project or to speculate on the extent of any future expenditure on the project.</P>

      <P>Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, in the case of projects funded under the 2001 programme, the grantees have until 27 September 2002 to submit all of the relevant documentation and a substantial amount of the work completed to facilitate the draw down of the grants. My Department retains the right to withdraw the grants after 27 September 2002 if these conditions are not met by the grantees. The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001 with a closing date of 4 January, 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,300 applications were received before the closing date and these are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed. Under a &lsquo;sunset clause' provision, it is the responsibility of grantees to ensure that the project commences within six months of the date of grant allocation and that a substantial amount of work is completed within twelve months. Failure to do so may result in the grant being withdrawn.</P>

      <P>As I have already outlined to the Deputy in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 2879/02 on the same issue, the national lottery-funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department, provides financial assistance to clubs-organisations for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities. The aims and objectives of the programme are: to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; as voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation, prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities, and encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
      <P>The programme is advertised annually and applications for funding from clubs-organisations have to be made on an individual basis. All applications received are assessed in accordance with a detailed set of criteria outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</P>
      <P>An application for funding was received from the organisation in question under the 2001 sports capital programme. Following assessment the application was deemed ineligible on the grounds that the applicant did not have the minimum local contribution and a feasibility study, which was required under the conditions of the programme given the estimated cost of the project, had not been carried out. The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001 with a closing date of 4 January 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. St. Joseph's School has not submitted an application under this programme. The 2003 sports capital programme will be advertised towards the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 538 together. </P>
      <P>CSO figures indicate that the total number of visitors from the USA and Canada during 2000 was 1,047,000, an increase of 11% on the 1999 figure of 943,000. The most recent CSO figures cover only the first nine months of 2001 and indicate that the number of visitors to Ireland from the USA and Canada in that period dropped by 9.8% on the same period in 2000 from 850,000 to 767,000. The comparable figure for 1999 was 776,000.</P>
      <P>Official CSO statistics for the year 2001 as a whole will not be available for some months. However, Bord Fáilte estimates the number of overseas visitors to Ireland has declined by about 7% in 2001 to 5.8 million visitors. The board expects the number of visitors to Ireland from the USA and Canada for 2001 as a whole to come in at around 915,000.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt but that 2002 will be a challenging year for Irish tourism. Tourism Ireland Limited is projecting a best case scenario for 2002 of a return to 2000 business levels, generally regarded as an excellent year for Irish tourism. This equates to an increase in the number of British visitors of 10%, growth of at least 6% in visitor numbers from mainland Europe and a minimisation of any further loss of traffic from North America. Following consultation with industry interests, Tourism Ireland Limited and Bord Fáilte have recently launched comprehensive marketing plans for 2002 designed to address the new market situation. Tourism Ireland's programme budget of &euro;27 million for 2002 for the international marketing of the island of Ireland is the largest ever annual budget allocated for such a purpose and is supplemented by substantial niche-product marketing funding by Bord Fáilte, which was further enhanced by an additional allocation of &euro;11 million to Bord Fáilte for this purpose in the recent budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism Ireland has already launched a new and exciting TV and print international advertising campaign for the island of Ireland, developed at a cost of approximately &euro;5 million. The com<Col N="723" /> pany's marketing plans for 2002 are responsive and flexible in nature, with an emphasis on tactical marketing and on co-operative initiatives with product providers, distribution trade and carriers, to take account of the changing circumstances arising from the events of 11 September.</P>
    <P>The focus on Britain, our nearest and largest market, will be particularly strong. They see a particular opportunity in the short break and additional holiday markets as Ireland is well positioned as a destination that is easily accessible by sea, particularly for the own car segment. Tourism Ireland is also targeting a revival of the holiday market from continental Europe during 2002 through prioritising geographic markets, by selectively encouraging and supporting new access gateways and routes into Ireland, and by getting an increased number of operators to feature Ireland in their promotional activities. Bord Fáilte, which will be operating in partnership with Tourism Ireland, has also recently launched its own complimentary programme of activities for 2002, which it will be undertaking on behalf of and in partnership with the industry. This will include an extensive promotion campaign in the Ireland market &ndash; both North and South &ndash; particularly from February to May and September to November, to encourage season extension; assisting industry with the packaging and marketing, through Tourism Ireland's overseas office network, of niche and specialist products such as golf, angling, heritage, walking-cycling, equestrian, watersports, conference and English as a foreign language; implementing the sports tourism initiative which is designed to win major international sporting events for Ireland into the future, and utilising the promotional opportunities arising from the positive media coverage associated with such events being in Ireland. During 2002 these will include the world cross country championships, the Smurfit European Open, the American Express World Championships, and the ITU Triathlon World Cup Series; developing guidelines and implementing the recent Government initiative to expand regional tourism though festivals and cultural events; and providing a promotional platform for media and journalist visits from the various markets.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has had extensive consultation, including a number of meetings of the Tourism Marketing Partnership, courtesy of representatives of the Industry, Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland, in the drawing up of these plans.</P>
    <P>Regarding the regional impact of these activities I recognise that, while all regions will benefit from the activities I have outlined above, there have, in the past, been some variations in performance. It has been one of my top priorities to facilitate a more balanced regional spread of tourism revenue and for this reason, following State aids approval by the European Commission, I was pleased to launch the new tourism product development scheme in January. This will be administered by Bord Fáilte and involves <Col N="724" /> some &euro;130 million of public sector funding under the BMW and southern and eastern regional operational programmes of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of this scheme is the development of the tourism product in a sustainable way, that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly-developed areas and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue. The scheme includes three categories as follows: the development of major attractors and clusters of attractors; the development of special interest pursuits; and tourism environmental management. The first two of these categories are targeted specifically at regions that are currently under-performing in terms of tourism development, and are designed to help such regions to achieve their tourism potential. The successful realisation of the measures is however dependent on, and directly related to, the delivery by relevant local and other authorities of the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls.</P>

      <P>The Special Olympics World Summer Games will be held in Ireland in June 2003, when Ireland will play host to an estimated 7,000 athletes, 3,000 coaches and delegates along with 28,000 relatives and friends. This will be the first time the games will be held outside the US and it will be the largest sporting event in the world in 2003.</P>
      <P>The Games Organising Committee, GOC, under the chairmanship of Mr. Denis O'Brien, has overall responsibility for the planning, organising, and financing of the games. The GOC has formed a number of sub-committees to address specific tasks and functions associated with delivering a successful games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The GOC informs me that it is making good progress with regard to the provision of accommodation. It has identified 169 towns around the island of Ireland that will play host to the athletes and their coaches in the four days prior to the games and accommodation there will be largely based in host families, with a certain amount of hotel and B&amp;B accommodation, depending on the preference of each individual host town committee. The GOC also advise that they secured accommodation at games time, from 21 to 29 June 2003, for the majority of the athletes and officials taking part in the games at schools, universities and hotels in the greater Dublin area and in Belfast where some of the games venues will also be located. The GOC will be launching their <Col N="725" /> Host a Family programme in April 2002, whereby the committee will call on families in the greater Dublin area to open their homes to the families of athletes who will be coming to the games in 2003. There has already been huge interest in this initiative. The committee will also be arranging for a dedicated accommodation reservation service, via a link from the 2003 Special Olympics website, which will offer a choice of a wide range of hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfasts in Dublin and surrounding areas. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 539 and 540 together.</P>
      <P>The RAPID programme, revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, which was launched in early 2001 is a focused initiative by the Government to target the most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country. The programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through targeting State resources, available under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Some 25 disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Dublin, Wicklow, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Louth were selected by Government for priority treatment under strand I of the RAPID programme. It should be noted that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for strand II of the RAPID programme which caters for provincial towns while the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is the lead Department for the CLÁR programme which is targeting rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" />Area implementation plans have been prepared for 13 of the 25 areas under strand 1 which encompass measures and initiatives across a broad spectrum of economic, social, environmental and cultural activities. As plans were prepared by local implementation teams for each individual local area the range of measures and initiatives will vary from area to area as will the level of national development plan funding which these proposals will lever. It is expected that the remaining plans will be submitted for consideration shortly.</P>
    <P>Area partnership companies have been very much involved in the development of the local area implementation plans. With regard to the community and voluntary sector, like the partnerships they, too, are represented on the area implementation teams which were tasked with developing the area implementation plans in each of the 25 areas.</P>
    <P>The community and voluntary sector are also represented on the national monitoring committee which has been established to monitor the implementation of strands I and II, provincial towns, of the programme at national level and will be reporting on progress to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. A list of the areas in strand 1 of the programme is shown in the following appendix:</P>

    <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. The boy in question was admitted to Oberstown Boys Centre on remand from Clonmel District Court on 12 March 2001. He was sub<Col N="729" /> sequently committed to Oberstown Boys Centre on 16 March 2001 by the Court. Following a further appearance before Cork District Court in September 2001, the boy absconded in Cork from a vehicle of Oberstown Boys Centre. The Garda are responsible for apprehending boys who abscond from the care of a centre in this manner and, accordingly, they were notified immediately.</P>
    <P>On Friday 22 February 2002, the Garda re-arrested the boy at Dublin Airport from where he was collected by staff from Oberstown Boys Centre and returned to the centre that evening. It is understood that illegal drugs were uncovered in the boy's luggage at the Airport and the Garda are now investigating the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 546 and 548 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At primary level, schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from £45, &euro;57.14, per pupil in 1997 to &euro;101.58, £80, per pupil in this school year. In addition a further increase of &euro;10 per pupil will <Col N="731" /> apply from September 2002 in respect of the 2002-03 school year.</P>
    <P>Special enhanced capitation rates are paid in respect of children with special needs who attend special schools or special classes dedicated to children with particular special needs. These special rates can range from &euro;359.34 to &euro;579 per pupil depending on the particular level of need involved. These rates will also be increasing by &euro;10 per pupil with effect from September 2002.</P>
    <P>At post primary level the main per capita grant amounts to &euro;256.49, £202, per pupil. The grant was increased from £177, &euro;224.74, to £184, &euro;233.63, in 1999. It was further increased by £8, &euro;10.16 to £192, &euro;243.79, in September 2000, and to £202, &euro;256.49, in September 2001. A further increase of &euro;10 is due from September 2002 in respect of the 2002-03 school year which will bring the rate per pupil to &euro;266.49.</P>

      <P>I met the three teacher unions last week on 28 February 2002. I indicated that the Government is not opposed to the pensionability of supervision payments. In that regard I offered to enter into a process at the end of the current school year to work out the details of an arrangement which would be consistent with the requirements for pensionability. I also indicated that the procedures provided by the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers should be used to deal with the issue of an appropriate payment rate for supervision. These procedures include independent arbitration where the parties cannot agree.</P>
      <P>My approach was welcomed by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the Teachers' Union of Ireland but rejected by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland.

      <P>At present, the courses run in the State that allow for appointment to a permanent post in a primary school are the three year bachelor of education degree and the full-time 18 month <Col N="734" /> graduate diploma in primary teaching. Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education which specialise in the training of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The bachelor of education degree programme offered at the colleges of education is designed to equip teachers to teach the full range of subjects in the Irish primary school curriculum. Teachers who have obtained a B.Ed degree from these colleges are permitted to teach in all national schools where they are required to complete a successful probationary period leading to full recognition as a primary teacher.</P>
      <P>During the bachelor of education programme, students must develop competencies in the full range of subjects to be taught in national schools, including Irish, and the award of the B.Ed degree signifies that the teacher involved is competent to teach all subjects on the curriculum. Consequently, the study of Irish is a core component in the B.Ed programme, and students entering colleges of education are required to have a minimum competence in this subject in their leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>Deaf children in general have enormous difficulty in acquiring a first language. As English is the preferred medium for the vast majority of deaf children, it is felt that the greatest emphasis should be placed in acquiring oral and written competence in English. Because of the difficulties some children have in acquiring a first language, English, exemption is given from the study of Irish to certain categories of children with special educational needs, including deaf children.</P>
      <P>Where children who are exempted from the study of Irish wish to pursue Irish, it is open to them to request their schools to provide instruction in Irish. My Department will provide support in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Significant and complex issues can arise in relation to access to the teaching profession by people with disabilities. I have made arrangements to establish a working group to examine and review the present arrangements in consultation with relevant interests, and having regard to best international practice in this area. I have asked the group to expedite its work and report to me at an early date.</P>

      <P>In 2000, as part of my Department's reading initiative, learning support guidelines were provided to all schools with the aim of ensuring that all children achieve appropriate levels of literacy and numeracy during the course of their primary education. The learning support guidelines recommend high levels of co-operation <Col N="735" /> between class teachers, learning support teachers and parents in supporting children who are experiencing learning difficulties. In selecting pupils for remedial education, priority should be given to those pupils who achieve scores at or below the 10th percentile in standardised tests in literacy-numeracy. To allow for measurement error, consideration may be given to selecting pupils who achieve scores up to and including the 12th percentile. Once schools are satisfied that the needs of pupils who have very low achievement or serious learning difficulties have been met, a limited degree of flexibility may be exercised in the deployment of the learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The principal teacher has overall responsibility for the school's learning support programme and for the operation of services for children with special educational needs. Once a pupil has come to the attention of the school because of low achievement or learning difficulties, it is possible for the class teacher, in the context of ongoing contact with the pupil's parents, to make them aware of the situation and to: ascertain the parent's views about the child's performance at school; outline school practices regarding the administration of diagnostic tests by the learning-support teacher; outline the support that is available to the pupils in school whose achievement is low and/or who experience learning difficulties; seek the parents' approval to proceed with the diagnostic assessment, which may lead to supplementary teaching; indicate that a meeting between the parents and the remedial teacher will take place following the diagnostic assessment and prior to the commencement of supplementary teaching.</P>
      <P>If, following diagnostic assessment, it is agreed that the pupil should receive remedial teaching, the parents can contribute to the development and implementation of their child's individual profile and learning programme by discussing the learning targets for their child and by identifying activities that can be implemented at home to support the work of the school in achieving the agreed targets.</P>

      <P>The educational disadvantage committee is composed of 21 members including the chairperson Professor Áine Hyland, Vice-President and Professor of Education at UCC. The composition of this committee is based on an expert rather than a representative model. All the nominees, therefore, were selected on the personal expertise they could offer to the committee in a lifelong learning context while maintaining a balance between all sectors. Parent representatives of primary, post primary and special school students are, therefore, not specifically identified. To facilitate participation by a wide range of education partners as well as bodies and agencies active in tackling social exclusion, I have also established a larger forum to address educational disadvantage. This forum will have a broad representation of all relevant interests including parents, will meet at least twice a year and will have a vital role in advising on issues relating to educational disadvantage and exclusion.</P>
      <P>The range of expertise on the committee and the forum will ensure that the needs of all students are considered.</P>

      <P>I have been informed that, since its establishment, a psychological service was provided to the school in question by a voluntary body under the aegis of the Southern Health Board. This service was withdrawn on a temporary basis, beginning in September 2001, due to the resignation of a member of staff.</P>
      <P>The children in the school have complex needs and many of them require support from both clinical and educational psychologists. The National Educational Psychological Service Agency is liaising with the voluntary body with the aim of eventually providing a joint clinical/educational psychological service to the school. NEPS is extending its service to further schools as additional psychologists are appointed. At present, the agency does not have a sufficient complement of psychologists in the southern region to be able to offer a full educational psychological service to all schools. However, a recruitment competition for additional psychologists is now nearing completion, and it is expected that a number of appointments will be made to the southern region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, NEPS has taken some preliminary steps towards offering a full service to this school. A NEPS senior psychologist experienced in the area of disability has undertaken a detailed analysis of its needs for educational psychological support. Members of the NEPS management team have arranged a series of visits to the school in order to discuss the outcomes of the survey with the school principal and with representatives of the parents. The school may avail of my Department's scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, full details of which are available from NEPS or from my Department's website.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the report to which the Deputy refers. Early school leaving is not a simple matter to resolve and this is confirmed by the contents of the report to which the Deputy refers. Interventions to combat early school leaving require time to make an impact and it is for this reason that my Department has initiated a programme comprising both legislative measures and special targeted initiatives to combat the problem of non-school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, will replace and reform current school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nationwide educational welfare service, with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives an adequate level of education. I have given approval for the recruitment of a chief executive officer for the new educational welfare service and the recruitment process is well advanced. The service will be implemented on a phased basis, in line with a plan being developed by the board. It is my intention that the new educational welfare service will, as soon as possible, cover the entire country.</P>
      <P>It is also important that we offer curricular choice which meets the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools. The junior certificate schools programme and the leaving certificate applied are two programmes which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision. Other programmes involve the allocation of additional teacher posts and funding to primary and post-primary schools serving pupils from disadvantaged families. The home-school-community scheme at both primary and post-primary levels aims to build relationships between schools and families that will foster an appreciation of education and encourage greater participation in school. All schools serving the area referred to in this report, both primary and post-primary are included in this scheme.</P>
      <P>An additional 2000 places were also provided across FÁS and the vocational education committees on youthreach-Traveller programmes for young people who have already left school, allied with guidance counselling, psychological and child care supports. In addition, my Department currently supports two initiatives aimed at increasing the retention of pupils in school, namely, the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level. Four of the post-primary schools in the area referred to in the report are included in the stay in school retention initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" />Significant funding has been made available to my Department under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to address the problem of early school leaving. I have provided a total of &euro;22.5 million for school completion initiatives in 2002. This will facilitate a significant expansion that will focus on areas with the greatest pupil retention difficulties as identified through my Department's post-primary pupil database. In this regard, proposals are under consideration in my Department and I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter shortly. It is only by sustained action across a number of fronts, curricular, legislative and direct support, that we will make progress in relation to this serious social problem.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Leitrim has not received a third level top-up grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants. The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in <Col N="744" /> respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over. In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant, a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that he or she must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, he or she may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, for example, where advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has been sought to date in the case of the student to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant are being reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation. Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF <Col N="745" /> aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain in college. I increased significantly the provision for the fund from &euro;2.49 million &ndash; £1.964 million &ndash; in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million &ndash; £5.9 million &ndash; in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes, the candidate's reckonable income for purposes of the means test is his or her gross income from all sources and the gross income of his or her parents or guardians where applicable. Certain social welfare and health board payments are not taken into account in the calculation of reckonable income. For the purposes of the 2001 schemes, reckonable income refers to all amounts received within the tax year ended 5 April 2001. The schemes contain a change in circumstances clause whereby the eligibility of a person may be assessed or reassessed by the grant awarding body in the event of changes, in circumstances relating to <i>inter alia</i> the candidate's reckonable income, which are likely to be permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" />Where it can be proved without doubt that overtime payments made within the relevant tax year are not of a recurrent nature, the local authority or VEC may disregard such payments when assessing the reckonable income of grant applicants. Any similar payments which are not of a recurrent nature could also be considered on a case by case basis by the relevant awarding body under the provisions of the change in circumstances clause in the schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 to 590, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The task force on autism recommended the adoption of a range of models for early intervention, including the applied behavioural analysis approach. The fundamental criterion identified by the task force is that the model of provision adopted should be that which is most appropriate to the assessed needs of the child at the time of the intervention and that responses should be capable of being adjusted in line with the child's evolving needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" />The experience and expertise of the members of the task force, coupled with the presentations they received from a range of experts and the more than 100 submissions received from interested parties, ensured that the task force was in a position to make fully informed judgments on the range of issues involved, including issues relating to applied behavioural analysis.</P>
    <P>While the report of the task force is being considered in my Department, it is fully recognised that the applied behavioural analysis method will be one of a range of approaches which will be required to be made available and in respect of which the staff involved will require the necessary specialist training. My Department's in-career development unit is considering how the necessary specialist training inputs can best be delivered and has a number of initiatives in place. It will continue to have full regard to best international practice and locally available expertise in developing the necessary training programmes.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction which has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. My Department expects to be in a position during this year to give detailed consideration to the application for improved accommodation at Rahan national school, Mallow, County <Col N="751" /> Cork as part of the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>With regard to the child in question, I confirm that, following receipt of a psychological assessment report on 7 February 2002, my Department approved an additional 2.5 hours resource teaching support per week for the child. This allocation brings the level of resource teacher support being made available to the child to five hours per week. Special needs assistant support of five hours per week has also been approved.</P>
      <P>I regret the Deputy's representations on behalf of the child in question were not responded to earlier. The delay arose because of the very large number of applications for special support services being received in my Department at the time as a result of the Government's decision that all children with special needs in primary schools should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The level of growth in this area is reflected in the fact that the number of resource teachers supporting children with special needs in the primary system has been increased from some 100 to more than 1,500, and the number of special needs assistants has been increased from less than 300 to more than 3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is in the process of introducing new streamlined arrangements for processing applications for resource teacher and special <Col N="756" /> needs assistant support in order to ensure a more timely response to such applications.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary school buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. In view of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. A proposed building project for the Convent of Mercy national school, Kells will proceed to architectural planning and to the preparation of tender documents as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received representations regarding a difficulty in finding suitable qualified teachers for appointment to gaelscoileanna; the number of teachers, in respect of each gaelscoil in the State, who teach in the school as a qualified teacher; and the number who are not qualified as a teacher.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain schools and not specifically gaelscoileanna are experiencing some difficulties in the recruitment of fully qualified primary teachers at present. The Government, since taking office, has retained the demographic dividend arising at primary level each year and has also created an unprecedented number of new teaching posts. Some 1,800 new teaching posts have been created which has enabled the Government to reduce the pupil teacher ratio from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 19.0:1 in the current school year. The overall pupil teacher ratio is now down to 14:1.</P>
      <P>The granting of this enormous number of additional teaching posts, allied to the fact that there are approximately 850 teachers on career break, 250 on secondment and 320 job sharing, has created an excessive demand for teachers in the short-term. The intake of undergraduates to primary teacher training colleges has been doubled from 500 in 1996-97 to 1,000 in the current academic year. The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2002-03 and 2003-04 academic years. In addition there are 280 students on an existing postgraduate course. A further postgraduate course with 440 places commenced in February this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to increasing the output of graduates, this Government has introduced other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September, 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and since September 2000, teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers trained in European Union countries <Col N="758" /> employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the European Union whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas's, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification, which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. The increase in the number of graduates and the other measures I have implemented as outlined will help to eliminate the current teacher shortage. The specific information requested by the Deputy is being compiled and will be forwarded to him in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 612 and 654 together.</P>
      <P>The unit cost figure for the Finglas children's centre for 2001, as already outlined to the Deputy, was estimated by reference to an operational capacity of 40 boys. That operational capacity of 40 was used in the calculation of the unit cost figures for each of the three years in respect of which details were requested as being representative of the operational capacity for the years in question. It also allows for comparison between the unit costs for each year. I do not propose to alter this method of calculation of unit costs for the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy refers to the independent inspection of the Finglas Children's Centre being carried out by Mr. M. Laxton, who is an inter<Col N="760" /> nationally recognised expert in the field of residential child care. The inspector will meet with centre management, staff and children resident in the centre in the course of the inspection. In addition, he will have access to my Department's files on the centre and files held by the centre itself, including those relating to personnel and staffing issues. This is an independent inspection and it would be inappropriate for me to try to direct the inspector to conduct the inspection in a particular manner. However, it is open to the inspector to meet with and interview any staff member of the centre and others, including former staff, where he considers this necessary and appropriate to the satisfactory completion of the inspection process. I reiterate my invitation to the Deputy to meet with the inspector if there are concerns that she wishes to bring to his attention in relation to this centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to report that my Department received a very good response to the recent circular to schools regarding examiner supply for certain tests. We received a significant number of additional applications for posts as examiners at the upcoming oral tests in leaving certificate Irish and French and, again, I want to take this opportunity to thank the applicants and schools concerned for their generous response.</P>
      <P>The circular did not request additional applicants for posts as examiners in the junior certificate home economics practical tests because my Department requested schools, in considering which teachers to release, to give priority to teachers who wished to act as examiners of leaving certificate examinations, particularly oral Irish and oral French. It is my Department's intention that the examining of the junior certificate home economics practical will proceed on the same basis as 2001.</P>
      <P>The availability of applicants to work as examiners on the oral and practical tests in question is invariably a function of the circumstances of individual applicants each year and the balance that schools must endeavour to strike annually between supporting the visiting-examiner model of assessment on the one hand, and minimising disruption caused by the release of teachers on the other hand.</P>
      <P>In an effort to address the examiner supply problem and other difficulties associated with the current arrangements for conducting the oral and practicals my Department established a working group representative of the partners in education to review current arrangements. Some progress was made as outlined to schools in November 2000. My Department continues to seek a way forward in this respect.  </P>

      <P>I signed the first public private partnership, PPP, contract under the Government's pilot PPP programme on 15 November 2001 with Jarvis plc for the provision of five new post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>The new schools, which will cater for about 3,500 pupils, are located in Tubbercurry, 675 pupils; Ballincollig, 1,000; Clones, 500; Dunmanway, 700; and Shannon, 600. The capital value of the schools project is over &euro;81.5 million. The five schools are currently under construction and it is intended that they will be available at the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>This pilot project was developed on a design, build, finance and operate basis. While the maintenance and operation of the buildings is a matter for the successful bidder for the duration of the service contract, in this case 25 years, the management of the schools and their day to day running will remain with the school management authorities. The State will retain legal ownership of all properties.</P>
      <P>The progress made on this school PPP project, and on other projects currently being developed at third level, demonstrates my strong commitment and that of my Department to the PPP process. I intend to harness the potential of PPPs and I am actively identifying other possible education PPP projects. The particular PPP format applied to any future projects will be assessed as part of the procurement process on a project-by-project basis.</P>

      <P>With effect from the 2002-03 academic year, the bachelor of science degree in nursing will also be an approved course for the purposes of the higher education maintenance grants scheme and the vocational education scholarship scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not made any proposal to reduce remedial class numbers in the school in question as suggested by the Deputy. In 2000, as part of my Department's reading initiative, learning support guidelines were provided to all schools, aimed at ensuring that all children achieve appropriate levels of literacy and numeracy during the course of their primary education. The learning support guidelines recommend high levels of co-operation between class teachers, learning support teachers and parents in supporting children who are experiencing learning difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In selecting pupils for remedial education, priority should be given to those pupils who achieve scores at or below the tenth percentile in standardised tests in literacy/numeracy. In order to allow for measurement error, consideration may be given to selecting pupils who achieve <Col N="774" /> scores up to and including the 12th percentile. Once schools are satisfied that the needs of pupils who have very low achievement or serious learning difficulties have been met, a limited degree of flexibility may be exercised in the deployment of the learning support teacher. The above considerations determine the numbers of children attending remedial classes at any given time.</P>
    <P>In addition to the learning support service, children assessed as having special educational needs who are attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis are entitled to the support of the resource teacher service. All schools have been advised of the procedures to be followed in accessing such support.</P>
    <P>A proposed building project for the school in question will proceed to architectural planning and to the preparation of tender documents as soon as possible under the expanded school building programme. The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools.

      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: (a) the higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and (d) maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate&ndash;PLC&ndash; courses.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the scheme for PLC students are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice <Col N="776" /> or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
    <P>With regard to the person referred to by the Deputy, County Mayo VEC contacted my Department in October 2001 to inquire about his eligibility under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate (PLC) Courses, 2001. County Mayo VEC was advised by my Department that, as he held a national certificate qualification, he was ineligible for funding to pursue a course approved for the purposes of the PLC maintenance grants scheme. In this regard clause 3.2 of the scheme states that candidates are ineligible if they already hold an NCVA level 2 or level 3 qualification, a third level qualification at national certificate, national diploma, degree, post-graduate or equivalent level. It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation <Col N="777" /> situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>Curranes National School is being extended-refurbished as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanding building programme.</P>
