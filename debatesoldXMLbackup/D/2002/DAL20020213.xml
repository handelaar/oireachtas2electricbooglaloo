      <P>Before we commence business, as Ceann Comhairle, I believe it is in the interests of the House to put on record a brief statement on the events surrounding the debate on the censure of Deputy Liam Lawlor. I am sure Members will agree that there should not be any confusion or misunderstanding of the High Court action in respect of the Dáil. What transpired on Thursday morning last, 7 February, was that Deputy Lawlor made an oral application to the court without notice to this House to be released from prison to attend the debate. In the circumstances, when the House became aware that the Deputy was due to arrive it was decided to postpone the debate for a brief period as a matter of courtesy.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the court did not grant an injunction against this House postponing or delaying the debate. If it had attempted to make such an order, this House could have challenged it in the court. Given that Deputy Lawlor was under the jurisdiction of the courts for contempt, the High Court had power to vary its sanctions as it saw fit. There was no court order preventing the debate from taking place if he was not present. As Members were aware, the Dáil was free to proceed with the debate notwithstanding that Deputy Lawlor would not necessarily be present. I believe it is necessary to put on record my decision on the approach adopted for the debate, which, as I said, was not affected by the court's decision to release Deputy Lawlor.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 22, motion re Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam &ndash; a proposal for a Council Directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or persons who otherwise need international protection; No. 4, Finance Bill, 2002 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; that No. 22 will be decided without debate; that No. 4 shall be taken today and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening speech of the Minister for Finance and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 45 minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case and Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply, which shall not exceed 20 minutes; that Question Time tomorrow shall be taken at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m. and that in the event of a private notice question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.

      <P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. Is the late sitting agreed to? Agreed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the intention is that there will be a guillotine on the Finance Bill tomorrow. The House will sit for very few days in March. The Finance Bill contains some new elements that are the subject of considerable controversy. I do not accept that we should have a guillotine tomorrow on Second Stage. There are many Members who would not otherwise participate in committee which will not necessarily enable them to make the points they want to make because they may just want to make a point about the proposals in respect of sportspersons, so ably criticised by the president of SIPTU this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. Is it the intention <Col N="555" /> to have a guillotine tomorrow on the Finance Bill? If so, the Labour Party will not accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Taoiseach is aware of a rather pleasant occasion this morning when people from North West Radio came to the Oireachtas studio and interviewed some of us. The interviews were broadcast to counties Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon and south Donegal. When I was in the studio Deputies Quinn and Gerry Reynolds were there with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey. The interviewer asked the Minister the reason the Government is proposing an abortion referendum. The Minister said the Government was proposing an abortion referendum because significant numbers of women in recent years had gone to their doctors indicating that they were suicidal and looking for abortions and that the Government had to act to stop this traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this the Government's position? If so, why was this argument not brought forward by the Minister for Health and Children <Col N="556" /> when he proposed the legislation in the House? Does the Taoiseach stand over this statement made by one of his Ministers? I was amazed that this argument was brought forward. As I know the medical profession is on record as stating that no abortion has been carried out in this country for any reason since the X case, what is the Government's position? It was an outrageous remark from which the Taoiseach should dissociate himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan said, I was in the same studio and heard the Minister, Deputy Fahey, make those points. My reaction was such that I turned to the presenter, Tommy Marron, and said he had a scoop because if the Government had evidence of individual cases of women who were citing suicidal tendencies and, therefore, seeking a termination in this country within the framework of the judgment in the X case, that was the first any of us had heard of it. If the Minister, with the collective responsibility of the Cabinet, is in possession of information that there has been an invocation of the Supreme Court judgment to justify and enable women with suicidal tendencies to seek to have pregnancies terminated in this country, it should be shared with all of us. Deputy Noonan and I are fairly accurately reflecting what the Minister said. As the transcript and recording exist, it is a matter of record. I am not citing him verbatim, but I am citing the thrust of what was said which was to the effect that the Government had received information that various women &ndash; more than one &ndash; were seeking abortions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was citing information, unless we have an inspired Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. A Minister of the Government with collective responsibility was saying there was information to the effect that women with suicidal tendencies were seeking abortions and that, therefore, the Government had to act to stop this. After he has had time to reflect and listen to the transcript, the Taoiseach at his press conference later today might give us this new information which has not previously been brought forward in the debate.</P>

      <P>I was aware there was a debate this morning. I thought they were debating issues relating to the general election as they affect County Mayo, not the referendum on 6 March, an issue I will be debating later. As I did not hear the debate and have not seen a transcript of it, I am not in a good position to comment on it. I am not aware of any case and do not think anyone would be, because if there was a woman&mdash;</P>

We can have it whatever way they like. I will answer all questions, as I do for five hours every week, but if there are interruptions, questions will not be answered.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan, I am not aware of any such case and do not think anybody would be because if there was a woman with suicidal tendencies and she, either alone or, more likely, with her family, was to seek an abortion, it would be to her doctor she would go and under doctors' code of practice in this country, that would not be permissible, nor would this information be made public. Therefore, I would not be aware of such a case and it is not a case that has been made. Perhaps a Deputy, Minister or somebody else has personal knowledge of such a case, but I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also asked the reason we are having this referendum. I promised that if Fianna Fáil came into government, we would hold a referendum on the question of abortion. In the wake of the Supreme Court judgment in the X case, it was clear there was unfinished business. It was highlighted by the Supreme Court and in Mr. Whitaker's report on constitutional issues. I was aware that the issue was complicated and that we would have to tackle it. I hoped we could build a consensus. The Government did not rush into any proposal and gave ample time for debate. We debated the issue with everybody who wished to express a view and for the first time ever propose giving statutory protection to the lives of pregnant women and current medical practice. We want to create the circumstances where no woman need fear that if she develops a life <Col N="558" /> threatening condition in pregnancy, her doctor will not save her life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not because we are insensitive to women or because, as some have suggested, we do not trust them that we ruled out suicide as a reason for seeking an abortion.</P>

The context of the question was why the Government is proceeding with this referendum. The Minister spoke on behalf of the Government. While not attempting to quote the Minister verbatim, I put it to the Taoiseach that the thrust of the Minister's remarks was that the Government's reason for bringing forward this referendum was to prevent women going to their doctors claiming they were suicidal and seeking an abortion, that this practice had been widespread over recent years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What I was trying to say when I was interrupted is that we did not rule out suicide as a reason to legislate for abortion because we were insensitive to women or because, as some suggested, we <Col N="561" /> did not trust them. That was not the argument. We did so because the evidence showed that where abortion is allowed on the basis of psychiatric consideration, the numbers seeking abortion rapidly increase. That is the position outside this country and that evidence was put before the Oireachtas committee. It has been put to my party and the Government by people who, I believe, know what they are talking about. I am not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but eminent people in this business have put forward that evidence. That is my only basis for this. We listened to leading psychiatrists who told us pregnancy, in itself, does not cause suicidal tendencies and in extremely rare cases where those tendencies might exist, abortion is not the appropriate treatment.</P>

As a justification for bringing forward this divisive referendum, he stated he has listened to leading psychiatrists and he cited them as a justification for this restrictive referendum on abortion.</P>
      <P>I draw to his attention and that of some of his colleagues a letter that has been sent to him by the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists at the request of the Irish division. It states:</P>
      <P>I am writing to you at the request of our Irish Division regarding your Government's Green Paper on Abortion which has quoted the Rawlinson Report . . . of 1994. This paragraph has misquoted a statement by Dr. Margaret Oates who gave evidence on behalf of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Unfortunately the Green Paper has repeated this misquote.</P>
      <P>At no time during her evidence did Dr. Oates say that there is &ldquo;no psychiatric justification for abortion&rdquo;. She did say that there was &ldquo;no <i>absolute</i> psychiatric indications for termination of pregnancy&rdquo; and went on to explain that statement by saying that termination of pregnancy&mdash;</P>

      <P>We, on this side of the House, want a debate on this referendum. We have not had a proper debate on it. The Taoiseach's surprise at the fact that the radio programme was even discussing this matter is an indication, I suspect, of his desire not to have a debate on it. It was perfectly reasonable for Tommy Marron to raise the question as to our attitudes to this issue since it is the first issue that will come before the electorate in this calendar year.</P>
      <P>As far as my party is concerned, we are opposed to this abortion referendum. Why does the Taoiseach continue in his scaremongering &ndash; that is the only way I can interpret it although I invite him to do otherwise &ndash; to cite someone like T. K.

I also understand the commission will not be charged with disseminating information but will simply draw attention to the fact that there is a referendum and advocate that people should vote on it. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the commission will not provide information concerning the nature of the proposal, either for or against it? Is the Taoiseach deliberately trying to reduce debate on this serious issue? We must recall that Second, Committee and Report Stages were guillotined. We did not have the full debate we wanted.</P>

      <P>With regard to the issue raised by Deputy Quinn, the reason I mentioned both the Supreme Court judgment in 1992 and what Mr. Whitaker said is that both stated the political system should act.

We want the proposal rejected and legislation put in place. We do not go as far as the Tánaiste did in 1992, when rape and incest were suggested as grounds for abortion. That is not our position. I accept that the motion adopted at our conference reflected within it two different points of view. The reality is that on 6 March the electorate is being asked to make a choice. We say that choice will diminish the rights and protections of women.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has cited psychiatrists in the past. The last paragraph of the letter from Professor John Cox, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, written to the Taoiseach at the request of the psychiatrists working in this jurisdiction, states: &ldquo;We would not want the debate on abortion in the Republic of Ireland to be misinformed and therefore we hope that the correct quotation is used in future.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach's requests for reasoned debate, which obviously Deputy Roche has not heard, suggest that in response to a letter from the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, to which Irish members are affiliated, he will use the available opportunity to correct the record and cite the correct quotation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring my seventh Finance Bill before the House. With the exception of two specially introduced Bills, this is my fifth annual Finance Bill and constitutes part of our budgetary policy designed to secure sustainable growth and increased living standards. This Bill implements the tax changes announced in the budget and includes a range of other measures. Deputies will be aware that the annual Finance Bill is considerable and this year it runs to 137 sections and six schedules. I propose to outline its main provisions in the time available to me. Committee Stage will provide an opportunity to debate the Bill in detail and I look forward to hearing the opinions of Deputies.</P>
      <P>One of the Government's central objectives in the area of personal taxation has been to have most income earners paying tax at no more than the standard rate. Before the Government took office, a single person with an income more than &euro;17,270 (£13,600) per annum became liable to pay the top rate. Such an income was below the average industrial wage as it stood in the first half of 1997. Following the 2002 budget, the same person will not pay tax at the higher rate until his or her income exceeds &euro;28,000 (£22,052), which is a sum comfortably above the average industrial wage as it now stands. The improvement has been brought about by the significant widening of the standard rate band through the budgets of this Government. Section 2 will give effect to a further widening of the band. This will remove a further 57,000 taxpayers from the top rate of tax. Section 3 gives effect to significant increases in basic tax credits resulting in further real progress towards our aim of exempting those on the minimum wage from the tax net. The increase of more than 14% in the combined value of the personal and employee credits provided for in the Bill means that the entry point to the tax system for a single person will be more than &euro;209 (£165) per week. That represents 90% of the current minimum wage as compared with &euro;98 (£77) per week in 1997-1998. A single-income married couple in receipt of the home carer's credit will be exempt from tax on the first &euro;22,350, which is equivalent to &euro;430 per week.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 the positive changes to the income tax system have taken 71,500 elderly people out of the tax net. The increases in income exemption limits for those aged over 65 years provided in section 4 will mean that the limits have almost doubled since 1997. They will now stand at &euro;13,000 for the single person and &euro;26,000 for married couples.</P>
      <P>The increases in credits provided for in the Bill, as well as the increased exemption limits for the elderly, mean that more than 79,000 people are being exempted from income tax altogether. Since the Government entered office, the number of those brought outside the tax net has increased to a record 692,000, representing 37% of all income earners. This compares with a figure of 380,000, or 25%, of income earners before the Government came to office.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the costs involved in caring for family members who are ill and incapacitated and consider the tax system should support people in these efforts. I made significant changes in the tax reliefs in this area last year and am taking further measures this year. The cost of employing a carer to care for a family member who is incapacitated can be claimed at an individual's marginal rate of tax subject to a ceiling. Section 5 increases the maximum allowed from &euro;12,700 to &euro;30,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Claims in respect of medical expenses which were not reimbursed can be made by an individual against tax at the marginal rate. Currently the relief is available for a person's medical expenses <Col N="579" /> which were not reimbursed or where an individual pays the expenses of a spouse or dependent child or of a widowed father or mother or incapacitated relative of the individual or his or her spouse. In section 9 this is now being extended to include a brother or sister, all parents whether widowed or not, grandparents and grandchildren. There is also a case for allowing claims in respect of non-relatives where these are elderly individuals aged 65 or over or those who are permanently incapacitated. The Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends the tax credit available in respect of local authority service charges. The maximum amount of service charges qualifying for the credit at present is &euro;195. This section removes the ceiling for services provided by local authority and private operations, other than for refuse collection services based on a tag system. This will allow a taxpayer claim a tax credit for the full charge for such services at the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The flat rate of tax charged on refunds of pension contributions has been 25% since 1992, when rates of tax were considerably higher. Section 10 reduces the rate for refunds made on or after 5 December 2001 to the standard income tax rate.</P>
    <P>As I indicated last week on the publication of the Bill, I will bring forward on Committee Stage of the Bill a number of changes in the pensions area to encourage employees to increase their level of pension cover.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the introduction of a new scheme of relief from income tax on their direct sports earnings for Irish resident sportspersons involved in certain sports. I am very conscious of the contribution such sportspeople make to Ireland's image and reputation as well as the short earnings career they have in many cases. I want to encourage world class Irish sportspersons to stay resident in Ireland and I recognise the contribution they make. This relief will also benefit our semi-professional sportspeople whose efforts bring enjoyment to so many.</P>
    <P>Qualifying sportspersons will be entitled to a deduction from earnings from direct participation in certain sports of the order of 40% for up to ten years of assessment back to and including the tax year 1990-91, provided the sports person was resident in the State in these years. Eligible income under the scheme will arise from direct participation in the sport and will not include income accruing from sponsorship, advertising or endorsements. The relief can be claimed in the year in which the sports person ceases to be permanently engaged in that sport, provided the individual is resident for tax in that year, and will begin by way of repayment of tax. The cost of this measure is not estimated to be very significant &ndash; it is unlikely to exceed &euro;5 million a year on average on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Section 13 amends the provisions governing approved profit sharing schemes and employee share ownership trusts to allow existing ESOTs or APSSs to continue to benefit where a take-<Col N="580" /> over takes place and the take-over company involved has no share capital or insufficient share capital available to do a full ordinary share for share exchange. I am aware of the arguments for extending these type of arrangements to more general gain-sharing schemes where cash payments rather than shares are involved. I appreciate the benefits such schemes can bring &ndash; a number of groups whom I met have made this case. However, there are difficulties in designing a scheme of tax relief in a way that does not lead to a more generalised scheme of tax relieved remuneration. Accordingly I do not consider it feasible for the moment to extend these schemes in the ways suggested.</P>
    <P>Section 14 limits the use by private investors of relief available for expenditure on significant buildings. In order to combat the unintended use of this relief by passive individual investors, there will be an annual limit of &euro;31,750 on the amount of losses that such investors can offset against their other income. This brings this relief into line with what applies generally for industrial buildings. Since this was announced in the budget I have been made aware of a number of projects where arrangements were already in place or at an advanced stage. Accordingly the Bill provides for certain transitional measures for such projects with a cut-off point of end 2003 for eligible expenditure.</P>
    <P>Section 15 extends the business expansion scheme and the seed capital scheme for a further period of two years. The existing company limit for these schemes is being increased to &euro;70,000. This initiative will further facilitate companies in raising funds, particularly small and start-up companies.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the reintroduction of mortgage interest relief as a deductible expense in calculating tax on rental income from residential property with effect from 1 January 2002. While this Government has made a number of changes in the taxation of the residential property market in recent years, circumstances have now changed and the presence of investors is required to secure the future supply of housing to meet accommodation needs. This change, together with the stamp duty change in sections 109 and 110, has already had an effect in restoring confidence in the housing market with positive implications for employment and output in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>Section 17 clarifies the situation on treatment for tax purposes of reverse premia and removes any doubts on the issue.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 to 21 deal with withholding tax and deposit interest retention tax. Interest paid to banks and building societies is currently exempt from the withholding tax requirement and section 18 extends this to interest paid to other financial services companies who make loans in the ordinary course of business.</P>
    <P>Section 19 removes interest paid on financial instruments known as euro commercial paper and certificates of deposit issued by certain financial <Col N="581" /> institutions from the DIRT tax regime and the company withholding tax regime. This will allow domestic financial institutions to compete more effectively in such markets. It should be noted, however, that there will be strict conditions imposed on deposit takers and-or purchasers of the financial instruments concerned, including the provision or supply of tax reference numbers and return of this information to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 20 removes the necessity for pension funds, charities and resident companies to complete a declaration form in order that the interest received on deposits by them is free of DIRT. Such authorities may obtain interest gross and I am satisfied the various audit and inspection powers introduced in the Finance Act, 1999, are sufficient to monitor compliance. Section 21 clarifies the operation of DIRT, in so far as it relates to special term accounts held with financial institutions, in particular, with credit unions.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for certain amendments to the scheme of capital allowances for hotels to meet European Commission approval under EU state aid rules. The House will recall that last year changes were made to this and other schemes to ensure that EU state aid ceilings were not breached, by providing in tax legislation that capital allowances could not he claimed for expenditure which had received grant aid. The Commission has since asked that this be extended to cover all possible forms of aid and not just grants. This is being provided for in this section and in section 26 in relation to the urban, town and rural renewal schemes. The scheme is also being amended to add additional items to be certified by Bord Fáilte in relation to general EU rules when certifying hotel projects as eligible for allowances.</P>
    <P>The House will note from what I have said on this, and will mention on other later items, that the European Commission has an active role in approving such reliefs under EU state aid rules and in applying certain new requirements and conditions to these reliefs.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 and 24 deal with extensions to the deadlines for qualifying expenditure in relation to a number of tax incentive schemes for property. They extend the existing 31 December 2002 deadline for relief for multi-storey car parks and the urban and rural renewal schemes until 31 December 2004. The period for qualifying student accommodation will be extended to 30 September 2005 and that for the park and ride scheme will be extended until 30 June 2004. The extensions to the deadlines in respect of the business elements of both the urban and the rural renewal schemes are subject to the signing of a commencement order once the extension is approved by the European Commission. No such EU approval process will be necessary for the residential elements of both of these schemes and it is hoped developers will take timely advantage of this extra time in order to proceed with the residential projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" />In addition to providing time extensions, section 24 amends the various sections that provide for the reliefs for residential investors and owner occupiers under the various urban, town and rural renewal schemes. Since the original inception of these reliefs in the mid-1980s the legislation has become both cumbersome and complex and up to now these reliefs have been provided for under separate legislation governing each scheme, a total of 12 schemes in all. This section codifies and consolidates the legislation and where appropriate redundant or non-activated sections have been deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 25 makes a number of amendments to both the Urban Renewal Act, 1998, and the Town Renewal Act, 2000, to allow the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to extend the rented residential relief to certain areas which were originally designated under both the town and urban renewal schemes for owner occupier relief only.</P>
    <P>These measures will have the effect of extending the relief for rented residential investors to an overall total of 1,785 sites in the areas designated under both schemes. Of these, 1,125 sites will be for new build development sites. It is hoped that, along with the restoration of relief for borrowings for residential investors, this measure will increase the level of the provision of rented residential accommodation in the areas designated under both schemes. While the provision applies generally as respects expenditure incurred on or after 5 December 2001, it is proposed for the sake of fairness that certain qualifying expenditure already incurred under the existing owner occupier scheme will also qualify for rented residential relief.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the abolition of the restriction on the amount of deductible motor car running expenses for corporation tax or income tax purposes. These expenses include expenditure on fuel, insurance, tax and repairs. This restriction was introduced in 1976 and operates by disallowing a portion of the expense where the cost of the car exceeds a certain threshold. This threshold was increased in the budget to &euro;22,000 and it applies for both new and second-hand cars. The expenses in question are those incurred in the course of a business or employment and the restriction is a somewhat artificial and cumbersome one that has outlived its usefulness. The abolition of the limit will take effect in relation to such expenses incurred in an accounting or basis period ending on or after 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>Section 28 makes a number of amendments to the special profit deferral arrangement and 100% stock relief that is available to farmers who receive compensation as a result of disease eradication measures. The two year period during which farmers can avail of this measure is to be extended to four years in respect of disposals which arise on or after 21 February 2001. The section also makes two technical amendments in order to clarify the interaction of this relief with the short tax year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" />Section 29 extends the definition of qualifying quota that can qualify for relief under the scheme of capital allowances for the purchase of milk quota. This relief is to be available in respect of any purchase of milk quota by active producers purchased on or after 1 April 2000. However, as before, the amount of the relief available is capped at the price set for the milk quota year by the Minister for Agriculture. Food and Rural Development for the purposes of the purchase of milk quota under a milk quota restructuring scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 30 simplifies the arrangements for the write-off period for wear and tear capital allowances for plant and machinery &ndash; particularly in relation to capital expenditure incurred before the change in the write-off period introduced last year.</P>
    <P>Section 31 amends the legislation providing for a scheme of capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private hospitals so as to streamline the provisions and improve the potential take-up of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for a scheme of capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of buildings used as private sports injury clinics. To qualify for the allowances, the sole or main business of the clinic must be the diagnosis, alleviation and treatment of sports-related injuries. The clinic must provide day-patient, in-patient, out-patient and surgical services and in-patient accommodation of at least 20 beds, and must contain an operating theatre or theatres and on-site diagnostic and therapeutic services. The scheme is subject to clearance by the European Commission from an EU state aids perspective. In both cases the European Commission requires that the capital allowance is not be available to anyone involved in the running of the hospital or clinic.</P>
    <P>Section 33 extends the qualifying period of the scheme for capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on certain buildings used for third-level education from 31 December 2002, to 31 December 2004. This scheme has made a useful contribution to the development of important educational infrastructure and its continuation should benefit the delivery of high quality third-level education facilities.</P>
    <P>Section 38 relates to the taxation of personal portfolio life assurance policies and is an anti-avoidance measure. I announced on 26 September last my intention to include legislation in the Finance Bill to change the tax treatment of personal portfolio life assurance policies and the measure will apply from that date. The main change is the imposition of a 20% surcharge on the proceeds of such policies. The section also provides for some additional rules governing the application of the surcharge to certain life assurance policies issued after budget day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" />Section 39 provides for a scheme of tax relief for donations to certain sports bodies for the funding of capital projects. I undertook last year, when I amalgamated and expanded the tax provisions concerning donations to charitable organisations and educational establishments, to examine the possibility of allowing sports bodies receive tax relief on donations. This was an issue raised with me in the Dáil last year by some Deputies. I was pleased to announce this new scheme in the budget. This relief is aimed at providing support to sports bodies around the country engaged in projects of a capital nature such as the construction or refurbishment of sports facilities. The estimated aggregate cost of the project must not be greater than &euro;40 million.</P>
    <P>Sections 41 to 43 and section 45 contain a number of technical amendments to the new exit tax system of taxation for collective funds and life assurance to streamline the application of certain declaration procedures which disapply the exit tax. Provision is also made to apply the corporation tax trading rate, rather than the non-trading tax rate, to payments and gains arising from certain foreign funds where held by a financial company as trading stock. The intention of section 44, as confirmed in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, is to remove a possible double charge for certain trusts to capital gains tax only. Paragraph (1)(<i>b</i>) of the section goes further than intended and I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to delete this. Section 46 provides a number of technical amendments to the special savings incentive account scheme which are required as a result of practical experience of the running of this scheme. Section 47 deals with special portfolio investment accounts which are being phased out. To encourage early closure of these accounts, this section allows investors who have unrelieved capital losses on their accounts to offset these against other capital gains when their account is closed.</P>
    <P>Section 49 gives effect to my budget announcement that a tonnage tax method for calculating the profits of shipping companies for the purposes of corporation tax would be introduced. Tonnage tax makes available an alternative method for shipping companies to calculate their profits for corporation tax purposes, though if a shipping company wishes to remain subject to the normal corporation tax rules for the calculation of its profits it may do so. Profits once calculated using the tonnage method are subject to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax the same as the profits of a shipping company calculated by reference to the normal rules. The tonnage tax profits are arrived at by reference to the tonnage of the ships used in the shipping trade. Subject to clearance by the European Commission from a state aid perspective, the tonnage tax will come into operation by way of a commencement order. This provision is aimed at providing a level playing field for Irish shipping companies<i> vis-á-vis</i> those in other EU member states with similar rules.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" />Section 50 allows for some easing in the rules regarding the offset of losses on trading income activities against profits made on non-trading income activities. This is in response to requests made by tax practitioners in relation to the strictness of the current rules. Section 54 gives effect to the budget measure that the payment date for preliminary tax is being brought forward to one month before the end of the accounting period &ndash; an advance of seven months. This brings the provision for the payment of corporation tax more in line with the general practice in other EU and OECD countries and in line with the rules for the payment of income tax. The measure is being introduced over a transitional period and will be fully effective for accounting periods ending after 2005 when 90% of final liability will be payable one month before the end of the accounting period. Any balance of tax due &ndash; over and above preliminary tax &ndash; will, as at present, remain payable within one month of the issue of the tax assessment by the Revenue Commissioners. It may be more difficult for a small company to accurately assess its potential corporation tax liability for the year. Accordingly provision is being made to allow small companies to pay either 90% of the current year's liability or 100% of the previous year's tax liability. A company will be treated as a small company if the corporation tax liability for the previous corresponding period does not exceed &euro;50,000. Corporation tax payable on any capital gains in the last month, which could be difficult to predict, does not have to be included in the 90% provided a top-up payment is made one month after the end of the period.</P>
    <P>Capital gains tax retirement relief applies where a person aged 55 years or over disposes of business assets by way of sale or gift, subject to certain conditions. Section 55 provides that personally held business assets, that is those held outside a family company, will also be eligible for retirement relief subject to certain conditions, including the condition that these assets must be disposed of together with the family company to the same person or persons. This facility already applies in the case of capital acquisitions tax business relief. Sections 57 and 58 deal with CGT reliefs in the case of a compulsory purchase order on farmland. The sections extend roll-over relief and early retirement relief to include land that was leased at the time of CPO provided it had been actively farmed and was leased for less than five years prior to the disposal.</P>
    <P>Sections 60 to 79 relate to betting duty, including provisions to consolidate and modernise the betting duty legislation. The existing legislation in this area, some of which dates back to 1926, has been supplemented and amended over time to the extent that it has become very fragmented and disjointed. The opportunity is being taken to streamline existing provisions and to introduce a new collection system. Section 63 confirms the budget decrease in the rate of excise duty on bets from 5% to 2% with effect from 1 May 2002. It <Col N="586" /> also includes a change in the definition of the amount of the bet to clarify the taxation of spread betting on a unit basis. Section 64 provides for a new exemption for tote bets placed in registered bookmaking premises. Section 67 allows the bookmaker to absorb and pay the betting tax rather than charge it to the customer. Section 74 includes the imposition of a new charge of &euro;2,000 where premises are re-registered following de-registration. These and the other changes in the Bill continue the process of up-dating excise law undertaken in recent Finance Acts.</P>
    <P>Sections 80 and 81 provide that all applicants for a permit required to operate amusement machines in public places must produce a tax clearance certificate. There is also a provision for the imposition of an excise duty of &euro;100 on the issue or renewal of such a permit. Section 82 provides that a tax clearance certificate is required when applying for various intoxicating liquor licences. Section 83 consolidates and standardises the Revenue's powers of entry and search of premises for excise purposes by the inclusion of premises in which bets are accepted and by clarifying powers of detention.</P>
    <P>Sections 84 to 86, inclusive, confirm the budget increases in rates of excise duty on tobacco, petrol, auto diesel, cider and perry. Section 85 also confirms the budget provision for a higher rate of duty to apply from 1 March 2002 on auto diesel with a higher sulphur content. Sections 87 and 88 extend both the repayment period and time limit for claims for repayment of mineral oil tax on heavy oil and liquid petroleum gas used for various purposes.</P>
    <P>Partial relief from mineral oil tax by way of repayment is provided for in certain road passenger services. The current criteria apply to a person who provides a passenger road service or provides a school transport service. In recognition of the importance of tourism to the economy and the key role played by coach tourism in this area, section 89 adds a new category of tour coaches used for extended group tours to the road passenger service section. The Bill provides that the extension of the relief and the current relief will be for those who can produce tax clearance certificates.</P>
    <P>Sections 95 to 106, inclusive, deal with value added tax. There are significant changes in the Bill in the VAT treatment of property transactions. Sections 95 and 96 are aimed at preventing the use of VAT property avoidance schemes. These have become a feature of the VAT system in recent years. I am anxious that such schemes be closed off when they are discovered and where there is a feasible way of doing so. Section 95 aims to prevent the use of low valuations to reduce the amount of VAT that should properly be paid on the surrender of possession of immovable goods in certain circumstances. Section 96 aims to prevent the use of the break-up of a VAT group as a way of avoiding VAT on immovable property which had been brought into the group and for which deduct<Col N="587" /> ibility had already been claimed. Section 97 introduces mechanisms to address the issue of payment of VAT by non-resident performers and mobile traders when they operate in the State. These replace existing mechanisms which had to be replaced by virtue of the adoption of an EU directive on the treatment of fiscal representatives. Section 99 provides for the increase in the standard rate of VAT from 20% to 21% announced in the budget. This increase, effective from 1 March 2002, will provide necessary additional revenue for the Exchequer. Some changes in administrative arrangements necessary for the effective functioning of the VAT system are also being introduced.</P>
    <P>Sections 109 and 110 give effect to the budget realignment of the investor stamp duty rates for transfers of new and second hand residential property with those for owner-occupiers, other than first-time buyers, purchasing second hand residential property. As I indicated earlier, this measure, together with others, was designed to encourage investment in the provision of rented residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>Sections 112 to 118, inclusive, deal with capital acquisitions tax. Existing provisions provide that, where a farmer has obtained 90% agricultural relief for CAT purposes on the gift or inheritance of certain farmlands and these lands are subsequently acquired from the farmer under a compulsory purchase order within six years of the transfer, the CAT relief given will be clawed back unless the lands are replaced within four years by other agricultural property. Section 112 provides for the period for replacement to be extended to six years instead of the four years as at present where the farmlands are compulsorily acquired.</P>
    <P>Section 117 brings the base date for aggregation for gifts or inheritances liable for CAT forward from 2 December 1988 to 5 December 1991. This measure takes effect for all gifts or inheritances taken on or after 5 December 2001, as announced in the budget. Section 118 provides that the exemption from CAT for life policies issued to non-residents by life companies located in the Irish Financial Services Centre is to be extended to cover life policies issued to nonresidents by domestic life assurance companies.</P>
    <P>Certain tax liabilities can be discharged by way of a donation of an approved heritage item to the national collections. Section 120 increases the annual limit for all objects given in a year from &euro;3.8 million to &euro;6 million as well as providing other amendments to improve the operation of the section.</P>
    <P>Sections 122 to 131, inclusive, deal with Revenue powers, penalties and administration. These measures implement recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts sub-committee on deposit interest retention tax and strengthen the penalties regime for failure to make a tax return. They also strengthen Revenue powers in a number of areas, including the publication of tax defaulters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" />The provisions regarding publication of the names of tax defaulters where the settlement figure is greater than &euro;12,700 is being extended to include Customs and Excise settlements. A similar provision is being made in the Social Welfare Bill relating to PRSI. Provision is being made to clarify that Revenue can publish names of tax defaulters on its website. However, where an underpayment of tax arises from a relatively minor default on the part of the taxpayer, specifically where the penalty element is 15% or less, the case will not be published. Such cases will be confined to situations where the nature of the default is merely &ldquo;insufficient care&rdquo; on the part of the taxpayer. If there is gross carelessness or deliberate default, the case will be published. Section 122 contains these amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 123 concerns tax clearance certificates relating to certain licences and public sector contracts. The section extends tax clearance provisions to all liquor licences and permits for public places in which amusement machines are located. It also converts existing provisions into a generally applicable tax clearance procedure covering applications for tax clearance for whatever reason other than those already catered for. As a result of this section, it will be possible to apply for and obtain tax clearance certificates through electronic means, for example, the Revenue ROS system. Revenue will also be permitted, subject to the applicant's agreement, to publish the certificate, for example, on a website where he or she may authorise persons to view it for verification purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 124 provides that the penalty for fraudulently or negligently making an incorrect return relating to DIRT or dividend withholding tax is tax-geared, that is, a proportion of the tax undercharge rather than being a fixed penalty. Section 125 changes the basis for calculating the interest charged by Revenue on unpaid tax and paid by it on overpaid tax. At present this is done on a monthly basis but, with effect from 1 September 2002, interest will be expressed as a daily rate and calculated on a daily basis. Arising from this change to a daily rate of interest, certain minimum interest charges are abolished.</P>
    <P>At present, a tax-geared penalty is imposed where a person fraudulently or negligently makes an incorrect return. This includes an individual's income tax return and certain other returns. Section 126 provides that a tax-geared penalty can be imposed where there is a tax undercharge and the person in question has not made the return concerned. It also equalises the penalties that can be imposed for failure to make a tax return, whether the failure referred to in that section is that of an individual or a company, and amends the method of recovery of penalties. Section 127 provides for tax-geared penalties where a tax undercharge arises and no return has been made.</P>
    <P>Revenue's power to obtain a court order to obtain information from financial institutions is being extended to make it more easily available <Col N="589" /> in Customs and Excise investigations. This is specifically targeted at cigarette smuggling. The range of records which can be accessed in a tax audit is being extended, and dividend withholding tax is being brought within Revenue's power of audit. These changes are contained in section 128.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to make it easier to prove in court that a person failed to make a tax return. At present, Revenue must show that the taxpayer &ldquo;knowingly and wilfully&rdquo; failed to make the return. Section 129 provides instead that a taxpayer can be prosecuted for failure to make a tax return unless he or she has a reasonable excuse. If a person is so prosecuted and the judge orders the taxpayer to make the return, then failure to do so will also be a revenue offence.</P>
    <P>Section 132 is concerned with repayable advances which were made to Shannon Free Development Limited out of the Central Fund to meet the expenditure incurred by that company in the provision of houses and certain community services since the 1960s in Shannon town. The purpose of this section is to enable the write-off of the repayable advances of around &euro;11.5 million when responsibility for these public utilities transfers to Clare County Council.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my Budget Statement, the introduction of euro coin has highlighted an anomaly in the way the economic benefit associated with the right to issue coin is brought to account in Ireland. The norm in other EU member states is for the state to receive this economic benefit. In Ireland, that benefit accrues to the currency reserve of the Central Bank, even though the bank merely acts as an agent of the State in the provision of coin. As proposed in the budget, I have taken steps to rectify the position in the Bill, and section 133 empowers the Minister to direct the Central Bank to pay into the Exchequer the accrued net proceeds arising from the issue of coin. The bank estimates that this will benefit the Exchequer to the extent of some &euro;370 million during 2002. My Department has consulted the European Central Bank on this proposal and it has no objections to the measure. In its comments on it, it notes that the change in the balance sheet treatment of coins is consistent with the accounting treatment of euro coins issued by other participating member states in accordance with Article 106 of the treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 135 clarifies the application of budget night financial resolutions to ensure such financial resolutions will amend the tax and related law as it stands immediately before the financial resolution takes effect. Sections 136 and 137 contain the usual technical provisions.</P>
    <P>In my time as Minister in my various Finance Bills I have made fundamental changes to the tax system. I have delivered reduced tax rates across the board &ndash; in income tax, corporation tax and capital tax. I have made the tax system fairer by introducing tax credits which ensure all taxpayers benefit equally from reliefs, and by closing off tax avoidance opportunities and broadening the tax base. I have streamlined and reformed the system <Col N="590" /> in a range of areas. I am happy to stand over this record.</P>
    <P>I hope the House has benefited from this outline of the provisions in the Bill. I look forward to the debate on it and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a speech on the Finance Bill, which seeks to implement his budget introduced only ten weeks ago, without once referring to the current economic situation. It is evident that the budget, to which the Bill seeks to give statutory provision, is already off the rails. The forecasts for this year, which the Minister announced on budget day, will be as wide of the mark as the projections of his Department for 2001. We have a situation which clearly demands corrective action, but the Minister, by his silence, ignores the very grave situation into which he and his Government have walked us. There is very little analysis of this situation in the newspapers and when Opposition figures draw attention to it they get very little media coverage. However, I was glad to hear at least one Government backbencher sounding alarm bells when he spoke at his party conference last week. I refer to Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>We know that the income for January this year is down 6% on the same month last year while current expenditure is 22% up. It does not take a scholar to see that if that trend were to continue for even a couple of months, we would be in a very grave financial position. The month of January 2002 replicates very closely what happened during the whole of 2001. Current expenditure escalated by 22% whereas income only increased by 3% or 4%, leaving the Minister with a tiny surplus, contrived by accountancy tricks and movement of money from one Estimate and one year to another. We had a nominal, but untrue small surplus last year, but even that amounted to only one twelfth of the surplus the Minister predicted. The figures for last year were unreal. The extent of the error by the Minister cannot be accounted for by reference to foot and mouth disease or the events of 11 September. There was a grave miscalculation in his Department. The returns for the first week in January 2002 appear to show that his miscalculation has continued. It has continued for political reasons to obscure the truth from the electorate until the general election is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obviously getting to the nub of this matter and irritating the Minister. The <Col N="591" /> error made recently by the AIB pales into insignificance compared to the error over which the Minister has presided. He inherited an economy from his predecessor, Deputy Quinn, which was on a trajectory of growth and leaves behind an economy which is on a trajectory of debt. These are not political charges. This is reality.</P>
      <P>The Government has deliberately fuelled current expenditure for political reasons which now threatens the very soundness of our economy. This expenditure bonanza cannot be identified in any obvious achievements. Where has all the money gone and where is it going? Shocking things remain undone after seven years of unparalleled growth and five years of the Minister's term of office.</P>
      <P>No one should be surprised at Fianna Fáil's performance in this respect. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Attorney General, Michael McDowell, however, have been shown by their mentor, Deputy O'Malley, to be both fools and knaves. As leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley had clear vision and strong convictions on which he was not for turning. Regrettably, the same cannot be said of his successor, the Tánaiste, who has overturned every principle she ever held, in order to facilitate every Fianna Fáil fudge in the past five years. Weakened by the departure of Mr. Pat Cox and now further weakened by the return of the would-be führer, the Attorney General, she has been reduced to a mere shadow of her distinguished predecessor. How does she respond to the lucid criticism of the Government's budgetary performance by Deputy O'Malley? She does nothing. She would prefer to upset him than to upset the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a creeping national emergency in which the duty of all patriots is obvious. The present situation requires a reversal of current expenditure plans. If the Government was patriotic, it would take corrective action now and not wait until after the general election. This cannot be expected of Fianna Fáil, but one would have expected it from the past rhetoric of the Tánaiste and the present hyperbole of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious hypocrisy and double thinking of the Attorney General are frightening. Last week, at the Progressive Democrats conference he derided as &ldquo;auction politics&rdquo; Fine Gael's consideration of the taxi men's case for some hardship fund, yet his own Progressive Democrats colleague and Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, announced at the very conference a similar scheme. It was painful to hear Mr. McDowell throughout an RTE radio interview trying to distinguish between the Government's scheme and ours. Of course the Progressive Democrats would never get involved in auction politics, or so he would have us believe. His hypocrisy was in full flight when he tried to drum up a fear of Labour's participation in Government. It is not for me to speak for the Labour Party but the last Govern<Col N="592" /> ment in which Labour participated with Fine Gael left behind a booming economy, including lower taxes, lower corporate taxes and a budget surplus. As I said earlier, the economy was on a trajectory of growth. Mr. McCreevy has now left us with hidden debts, including acknowledged debts for next year and the year after. The reality is that a Government is as strong as its weakest link and the Progressive Democrats are the weakest link. No action will be taken by a Government in which Deputy Harney is Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil predominates. The crisis will be left for the next Government to deal with. It is already clear that one of the first requirements of the next Government will be to take immediate action to curtail current expenditure.</P>
    <P>To return to the question I have asked on several occasions previously, where has all the money gone? It is difficult to answer the question as there are so many deficiencies in society. People on £106 a week, or &euro;135, do not qualify for a medical card. They are expected to pay £25 to £30 per visit to the doctor out of £106. Compare that to the largesse the Minister has poured out for 7% of the population who earn more than £200,000 and who have gained £60,000 to £70,000 per annum in tax concessions. It is no wonder he looks guilty and uncomfortable.</P>
    <P>There is an eight year waiting list for orthodontic treatment. Children go right through secondary school without obtaining orthodontic treatment and live with the consequences for the rest of their lives. In Northern Ireland there is a one year waiting list. The most shocking thing of all is that 20% of children leaving primary school do so with learning difficulties. Three quarters of these cases could be avoided if the resources were provided, and I will return to that issue in a moment.</P>
    <P>The housing problem is worse than it was when I joined politics 32 years ago. Thousands of people in this city, and cities and towns throughout the country, live in grossly overcrowded conditions and squalor. I cannot understand how the Taoiseach who shares my constituency and who must see the same things I see has done so little about this problem. There has been a massive increase in the numbers of homeless people. The waiting lists in the health service are much longer than they were five years ago. There is a 41% increase in the Taoiseach's constituency and a 91% increase in the children's hospital, Crumlin. The list goes on and on. There are many people, such as widows in my constituency, who are permanently sick, invalided, living on their own and trying to live on £90 a week. These people cannot afford a haircut, a coat, a pair of shoes or to go for a pint while 7% of people, an extraordinary number, who earn £200,000 or more per annum will receive £60,000, £70,000 or more in tax concessions. All the lolly has gone to these people. The Minister is leaving behind something very shocking. He has consigned a generation of young people in primary school to a life of disadvantage. Of the 20% of children who leave pri<Col N="593" /> mary school with learning disabilities, three quarters would not need to do so if the resources were provided on time.</P>
    <P>There are Education Acts with rights expressed in law and among the rights of children is a right to psychological assessment. The Department of Education and Science rules that unless one has that assessment one will not obtain the resources for an extra remedial teacher or home liaison officer. In my constituency of Dublin Central and one or two neighbouring constituencies, which have probably the biggest cohort of the most deprived people in the country, the children cannot get a psychological assessment because there are only 1.5 psychologists available in an area where there should be 11. The queues get longer each day and the children leave school without psychological assessment or they get it so late in primary school that they have severe learning difficulties. I know this because I recently visited several schools in my constituency. I was horrified in the case of one school where just under half the pupils had learning difficulties and could get no psychological assessment. I approached the Department of Education and Science on the matter and am still awaiting progress. I then raised the money to get these children a psychological assessment, which they are now receiving. I was prompted to do so because if children in better off areas need psychological assessment most parents are in a position to pay £200 to get the assessment. Schools in betters off areas who have this certificate can get the extra resources. Because parents cannot afford the £200, and the State will not live up to its obligations in the areas which need resources most, children are doubly disadvantaged. These children leave school with literacy and numeracy problems and in 95% of cases embark on a life of disadvantage. That is what the Minister has left behind and he ought to be ashamed.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difference between the outgoing Government and the alternative Government will be that these burning social needs will be addressed by the latter, but have been totally neglected by the current Government which does not have the excuse of lack of resources. It is the first Government in the history of the country which does not have that excuse. It had all the resources in the world but the Minister reduced tax from 20% to 10%, 5% and 2% and capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. This was mostly justifiable but why could he not find the resources for these young children? I imagine if we were to identify all the young children in school who need psychological assessment, and provided the money for them to get their assessment, it would not cost £100 million. It would be a once-off cost. It burns me up to see very good children being totally consigned to disadvantage for the rest of their lives. It is an affront to me and I feel personally guilty that I have not kicked up more about it or about the case of widows and individuals living solely on social welfare who cannot work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" />Mr. O'Malley said the day of the budget did ten times more damage to the economy than 11 September. That is not to say that the events of 11 September did not add to the stalling of the economy, but the budget of 5 December fuelled the already raging growth in public expenditure. Reckless politics and reckless financial control were evident and the Minister had the gall to attack the one proposal Fine Gael has made that would cost money, that is the justifiable proposal of giving ordinary Eircom shareholders the same tax rebates that the wealthy have already got. It would be a once off cost of not more than &euro;90 million, not a repetitive cost. Again, it is a case of social justice over which Fine Gael is standing. That once off cost of &euro;90 million compares favourably to the outrageous spending plan of a Government which has been reckless in the extreme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has lost control of the economy. He was passed on a golden economy but now he passes on an economy in difficulty. His performance received rave reviews during the period of unparalleled growth. He was taken in by the propaganda that he could do no wrong. However, much has gone wrong. The Central Bank continues to give me cause for worry. Under the scrutiny of the Committee of Public Accounts, it made not just a poor impression but a very poor impression. It presided over the DIRT scandal and now it seems to have been remiss again in its role as supervisor of the Allied Irish Bank.</P>
    <P>The present governor will retire next month. The Government has decided to nominate the Secretary General of the Department of Finance to be the next governor. This is in direct contravention of the recommendations of the DIRT inquiry, which wanted a distance put between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance. For a long time, the Central Bank has been a mere parrot of the Department of Finance. They think alike because of their close relations, as do the Revenue Commissioners unfortunately. This was highlighted by their common views on the capital flight theory, which bore no examination whatsoever. There was no basis to it. A fashion developed in the Department of Finance in respect of capital flight and doing nothing about evasion, and the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners were of the same thinking. The fact that there was no independent thinking in the Central Bank or Revenue Commissioners led to one copying the other, complacency and a lack of independent critical analysis. That will continue although I want to make clear that the present Secretary General of the Department of Finance is a distinguished public servant. My comments are in no way personal to him.</P>
    <P>We need to separate the thinking of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank so the latter will be a truly independent critic or observer of the economy capable of making truly independent critiques in the national interest. That is all the more necessary because of the gaps <Col N="595" /> the Committee of Public Accounts identified in the Central Bank. The Central Bank has been a mere parrot of the Department of Finance in terms of its thinking. It has been lethargic and indifferent.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the Minister's failure to bring forward the long-promised Bill to establish a new single regulator. The agreement on the substance of the Bill took a long time to be achieved. That was a year ago. A year later, there is no sign of the Bill. It is another case of gross inaction by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Government has not given effect to another important recommendation of the DIRT inquiry. It has accepted it in principle but there is no Bill. I refer to a Bill to set up a statutory oversight board for the accountancy and audit profession. This is now becoming a very serious national and international issue. In the United States, the Andersen relationship with Enron is giving rise to huge concerns in the market about what they call accountancy overhang. A lack of independence and effectiveness on the part of auditors is beginning to be a problem. It appears to be a problem in AIB. Not only were the Central Bank and internal controls and management deficient, but the internal and external auditors were also deficient, as were the regulators. This was a clear case bringing itself to bear on DIRT &ndash; the auditors were compromised because they were getting other consultancy work from the same banks. If they kept their mouths shut, were nice, decent boys with regard to the audit and did not cause difficulties, they got other consultancy work which was very lucrative.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a conflict of interest and now it is becoming a major issue in the stock markets. It is an issue that is pertinent to Elan and AIB and the major case in the United States at the moment. Yet the Government has failed. It is now in its dying days and there is still no Bill to establish the accountancy oversight board. It is urgent, just as it is urgent for the single regulator to be brought in and for the Central Bank to be overhauled and reformed very quickly.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed at the continuing failures of the board of the AIB group and its senior management. Their inaction and inefficiency have now been a cause for concern three times. On at least two of these occasions, their poor performance could have been a threat to the stability to the Irish financial system, including the recent difficulty. It could easily have been of a higher scale and threatened the very viability of the bank itself, thus causing major problems for the Irish banking system. Thankfully, it appears that the problem is not of that scale and we are in a better position to deal with those sort of problems than we might have been some years ago.</P>
    <P>It will not suffice for heads to roll in Baltimore. The buck stops in Dublin and, not for the first time, Dublin has been found wanting. The lack of critical analysis of the Minister's performance by the Irish media is in stark contrast to the cres<Col N="596" /> cendo of vitriol that descended on Fine Gael and Deputy Noonan for our proposal to treat ordinary Eircom shareholders in the same way as corporate institutional shareholders. Fine Gael is standing by its Eircom tax rebate proposal in the interests of social justice. It is our only commitment so far with any financial implications for the Exchequer. Moreover, its financial implications will be once off and will not cost more than &euro;90 million.</P>
    <P>The media severely criticised Fine Gael for proposing compensation for cases of severe hardship among taxi drivers but have made no criticism whatsoever of the Government's later, but similar, proposal. Queries were raised when Deputy Noonan expressed a wish that the Pensions Board might consider investing in Irish roads on the same basis as private sector investors, but the same media made no criticism when it became known that the Minister for Finance had previously written to the board making exactly the same point. That did not stop his colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, going on the radio and berating Fine Gael for wanting to raid the pension fund, which is a load of nonsense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan was expressing exactly the sentiments that the Minister had expressed privately. We are not expecting the Pensions Board to invest in any project that will not bring it a comparable return. We are drawing to its attention the fact the infrastructural development is important and would bring economic gain. However, economic gain for the country is not good enough to justify its investment. There must also be financial gain and we believe there could be a double gain.</P>
    <P>There are other lessons we should learn from the Eircom debacle. There must be transparency and openness in the flotation of a semi-State company. We now know the Government deliberately fixed the Eircom flotation price at a figure higher than that recommended by the board of Eircom. Such behaviour would not be permissible in the private sector as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment well knows. Duping our citizens can never be in the national interest. Consequently Fine Gael will guarantee that the flotation price of any semi-State company in the future will be set by an independent figure. This measure combined with our tax rebate proposal for ordinary Eircom investors should help restore public confidence in any future flotation process.</P>
    <P>I have loudly and appropriately criticised the Minister's failure to control current public expenditure. His failure is of such a scale that it has the potential to undermine the soundness of our economy. I have the opposite criticism of capital spending. The Minister has not used the full capital expenditure budget in each of the past two years. There are four or five road projects ready to start this week that have been postponed by the Department. I do not understand that think<Col N="597" /> ing. Investment in infrastructure brings an economic gain by sowing the seed of future economic growth. It also helps to address other issues. For instance, the housing problem in Dublin would be much less acute if people could commute from the outskirts of the city. To get from Lucan to the city centre takes two hours in the morning and two hours to get back in the evening. Young couples drag their sleeping children out of bed, bring them to the crèche and drive to work in deep frustration. They do the same in the evening when they collect their sleeping children from the crèche. This is a cause of deep stress and concern to these young couples, both of whom now have to work to pay a mortgage on a house in the Dublin area. Apart from the economic benefits of having good infrastructural connections, there would be social benefits because people like those could commute from Lucan and also from places in the Minister's constituency like Leixlip, Celbridge and Maynooth with other areas of Dublin's neighbouring counties. However, they cannot do so because of traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>I am a severe critic of the present traffic policy, which is not a matter for the Minister for Finance. Dublin has a crazy onedimensional traffic policy that has worked nowhere else and is not working here. It is driving the electorate mad and is causing severe stress and health problems. It is affecting the quality of life, but so too is the failure of the Government to build key connections into and out of our cities. The Minister knows well the two main roads into Dublin from County Kildare and he knows how difficult it is to commute. However, the road from Leixlip and Lucan only needs about five overpasses to allow very quick access into Dublin. Yet the Dublin Transportation Office, the director of traffic for Dublin and the Government fail to address the issue.</P>
    <P>There is an ideological philosophy in the Dublin Transportation Office to drive the motorist off the road. I was Minister for Transport and beforehand I was a transport manager. I know transport economics. We have chosen a low-rise low-density city which means it spreads out into Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. That has inevitable consequences for car use and public transport use. Public transport is diminished by low-rise development and is helped by high-rise and high density. The need for car use is all the greater given the planning policy we have unanimously adopted in this city over the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>Even so, and despite our growth of the past seven years, we still do not have the same car numbers per head of population as other EU countries, whose incomes we now exceed in most cases. Therefore we can expect a further increase in car numbers. What has the DTO done? It has acted in direct contradiction of the National Roads Authority. On the famous C-ring motorway around Dublin, there are two sets of policies working in direct contradiction of each other. It is best exemplified by the Naas Road on which the Minister drives every morning. In the past two or three years, we have spent tens of millions <Col N="598" /> of pounds widening the Naas Road to three lanes from Newlands Cross outwards. It was already three lanes from the M50 to Newlands Cross, which is only 300 yards anyway. What is being done from Newlands Cross inwards, where the city takes over? It is being narrowed to one lane.</P>
    <P>This ideology in Dublin city is driving motorists and citizens mad and is affecting the quality of life. It is preventing young couples from seeing their young children awake any day of the week. To go to the local village to get a newspaper is now impossible because of traffic. This is as a direct result of contradictory Government policy between the NRA, the Dublin Transportation Office and Mr. Owen Keegan, the Dublin Corporation director of traffic. The Government should call a halt immediately.</P>
    <P>It is not just that they will not build overpasses and underpasses as has been done in Paris, Brussels, London and everywhere else in the world, but they are deliberately putting in parking lanes where they are not needed in order to frustrate traffic. Cycle lanes have been created on some roads where the footpaths are wide enough to accommodate them to frustrate traffic. Dangerous chicanes and islands which are accident hazards have been put in to frustrate traffic. This policy must be stopped. The Minister is responsible for the allocation of funds for roads and I ask him to provide the money to start the bypasses that are already delayed, such as the Monasterevin bypass. Plans should immediately be initiated to put overpasses and underpasses on the road from Lucan to Dublin, the Naas Road and the other roads where that can be done. Within the city, if there were underpasses in about ten locations, there would be a huge improvement in the traffic. One person who knows about these things summed it up for me by saying that Dublin does not have a traffic problem, it has a roads problem. Why do environmentalists think it is good to have traffic jams? They pollute the atmosphere and strain people's nerves. Flowing traffic is much less polluting and harmful to the environment.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister frustrating and delaying the national development plan? Can he explain this on economic, social or environmental grounds when he is missing his own targets and the objectives in the national development plan are already in most cases more than a year behind even though the plan is only two years old? This will be another major issue in the forthcoming election. It is amazing to think of the things the Government has failed to deliver. Housing output is down and the housing crisis is growing. This is directly connected to the failure to build the connecting roads into and out of cities. I am talking about Dublin, but this is also true elsewhere. I want to make it clear that if there is a change of Government, Fine Gael will not only spend all the proposed allocation on capital projects but, if necessary, it will borrow to spend more on them. The Minister ridiculously went out of his way to make it appear that he was not borrowing, as if that was something great. He should have bor<Col N="599" /> rowed for capital purposes because there is a return on capital investment. The longer we delay such investment, the longer we delay a return on it. I would have thought that was obvious from the experience of the past 50 years.</P>

      <P>The critique of the delays in implementing the national development plan is not confined to the Opposition benches. It irritated the Minister for Finance that CIF criticised the delays, but it did so because it had good reason to do so. Forfás criticised them, saying the Government has built only 33 kilometres of the 1,361 kilometres of motorway proposed in the national development plan. At that rate it will take 39 years to achieve what the Government has set as an objective. That represents ludicrous economic management.</P>
      <P>In respect of Dublin alone, Dublin Chamber of Commerce reckons traffic congestion in the city is costing the economy £1 billion per annum. We will put forward serious proposals in respect of road and traffic management, an area the Government has manifestly failed to address, in the same way as it has failed to address housing. It has reversed its policy on housing several times. Its housing policies have led directly to a drop in the number of house starts compared to previous years at a time when the demand for housing is greater than ever before.</P>
      <P>With individualisation the gap in income tax liability between two earner couples and one earner couples increased in the budget and the difference is almost £60 per week. A man from Mullingar telephoned me recently to tell me his wife had lost her job as a result of which he pays £42 per week more in income tax. That increase in income tax was based on a difference in income of £13,000. That man's income tax liability has increased in the budget. I told him I had news for him, that this year he will pay almost £60 more in income tax than if his wife was earning. Not only are one earner couples at the loss of a second income but they pay more tax than two earner couples.</P>

It states that a married couple with one income will come under the standard rate band of &euro;37,000 while a married couple with two incomes will come under the standard rate band of &euro;56,000. The difference between the two bands is &euro;19,000.

      <P>Fine Gael will introduce a Bill early in the life of the next Government to control the transfer of reserves from the Central Bank and the social insurance fund. That will ensure that no Minister, when caught in a corner, can exploit in an unconscionable way those reserves. They should be subject to the application of clear rules. When transferable, those moneys should be transferred to the national pension reserve fund. There should be a link between the social insurance fund and the national pension reserve fund, given that the latter is supposed to provide cover in future for items that were covered by the social insurance fund.</P>
      <P>When Fine Gael publishes its manifesto, we will set out clear parameters regarding taxation and current expenditure. Every proposal will be costed by the Department of Finance and will be included in sensible projections of economic growth over the next five years, which in turn will have been checked with the Department and the ESRI. Every expenditure commitment we make will be contained within those parameters. There will be no auction politics by Fine Gael, but that does not mean we will not address manifest cases of social injustice. We will set out the clear difference between ourselves and the Government. All our well costed proposals will be contained within prudent estimates of revenue growth for the next five years.</P>
      <P>I want to return to the first point I made. The Government and the Minister have done an AIB on the economy. An economy that was growing rapidly is now heading for a crash if current expenditure is not controlled. The Minister's legacy is a disgrace given what his inheritance was.</P>

      <P>Arising from exchanges on the Order of Business this morning, I indicated to the House that I would return to the issue of ruling on remarks allegedly made, but not heard at the time by the Chair. As I indicated, the long-standing rule is that the Chair cannot rule on remarks that he does not hear. Like my many predecessors, I intend to uphold that rule which is in keeping with the orderly, expeditious transaction of the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to a once-off incident last November when I was obliged to have recourse <Col N="603" /> to the audio tape of proceedings, but that was in very unusual and completely different circumstances. It would be incorrect, and make no sense, to extrapolate this incident into a precedent whereby the Chair would be obliged to suspend the House and seek recourse to the audio record to establish whether alleged disorderly remarks had been made. Clearly, apart from the time lost to the House &ndash; almost 25 minutes today &ndash; it would not be feasible and would be a recipe for parliamentary chaos.</P>
    <P>I remind Members that the Dáil is not a court of law. While political charges are in order, personal charges may not be made. Therefore, should circumstances similar to today's recur, I will not suspend the sitting to listen to audio tapes and will adhere to the long-standing rule of the Chair. There is no other way to conduct business.</P>

I do not wish to do so now, but, given the available technology, there may be other ways of dealing with the matter.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, the high level group on regulation and the quality customer service working group are key parts of the public service modernisation programme in my Depart<Col N="604" /> ment. As I informed the House in my reply on 27 November 2001, considerable progress has been made by the high level group on regulation since its establishment in May 2001 following publication of the OECD review of regulatory reform in Ireland. The group has met eight times to date and is currently overseeing progress in two main areas.</P>
    <P>First, a public consultation document on better regulation is being finalised. This will be the starting point for a wide ranging consultation process on better regulation. This consultation process is scheduled to commence in late February and it is intended that it will culminate in publication of a national policy statement.</P>
    <P>Second, the high level group is overseeing the development of a system of regulatory impact analysis. As Deputies may know, this is a systematic, rigorous assessment of proposed regulations before they are enacted. The group is examining the range of models of regulatory impact analysis used by other countries with a view to identifying the type of system that will best suit our particular policy making processes and structures. It is intended to bring forward proposals later in the year following further consultation with Departments.</P>
    <P>Apart from these two major areas of work, the high level group is also monitoring the progress of regulatory reform measures and reviews in particular sectors and policy areas.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference and composition of the high level group were notified to the House in the course of my reply on 22 May 2001 and are being circulated again for ease of reference. As can be seen from the terms of reference, the group has been asked to submit a final report to the Government within one year. I have, of course, received progress updates on a regular basis and met the group last October. The secretariat for the group is provided by staff in the public service modernisation division of my Department. Some minor non-pay costs are associated with the group's work, mainly relating to publishing documents, hosting a seminar and obtaining external expert advice.</P>
    <P>The quality customer service working group was first established in 1997 on foot of a recommendation in Delivering Better Government. Its aim was to develop proposals to improve customer service in the Civil Service. Arising from these proposals, Departments and Offices prepared customer action plans, covering the years 1997-99, based on nine principles of quality customer service, QCS.</P>
    <P>In 1999, a new working group was established, chaired by Dermot Quigley, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, to chart the next phase of QCS. This group revised the original principles, adding three new ones: equality-diversity, official languages equality and the internal customer. New customer action plans, to cover the years 2001-04, have now been produced by most Departments or Offices. My Department has <Col N="605" /> commissioned a desktop evaluation of these plans which will be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>As well as developing policy, the working group has provided practical support for Departments in their efforts to improve customer service. For example, the group published a practical guide on how to produce customer action plans. A network for QCS officers has also been established to help Departments deal with implementation issues. This network allows officers to share good practice and learn from each other. It has organised presentations, seminars and a training day to support this process. The working group has also published a support pack on the equality-diversity aspect of QCS and, through its benchmarking sub-group, has examined quality accreditation schemes and how they could be introduced to the civil and public service.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, a comprehensive evaluation of the SMI modernisation programme is being conducted by PA Consulting. I expect that the results of this evaluation, due shortly, will provide a useful analysis of progress to date on the modernisation programme and make recommendations on the priorities for the next phase of the programme, including in the areas of regulatory reform and quality customer service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply. He stated the OECD regulatory group, raised in Deputy John Bruton's question, has met eight times and is due to finalise its report. Was it consulted on the Government's recent decision to deregulate the pharmacy sector as it affects the location of chemists? If so, what was its view and advice? Has it been asked to advise on the operation, as it has now impacted across our country, of the changes in the licensing laws?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has responsibility for this area but a pharmacy review group is involved in this issue, though not on my side with the regulatory reform group. There would have been no communication with that group.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the review group may be revised in view of current developments, in conjunction with the group's chairman and the Minister. The review group has been asked to report as quickly as possible in response to the new developments on the type of framework, statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy systems. That will be considered when the group reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The pharmacy review group, which is under the Minister for Health and Children, is in operation. That is the group dealing with the pharmacy regulations. Regarding the group to which I referred, I have outlined its work and given a copy of its terms of reference. It is not involved in day to day issues but is planning better regulations for the country for the future, how we can have a national policy document and how, in future, we can have impact analysis for new regulations. It is not involved in day to day issues in any Department regarding existing regulations. To be helpful to the Deputy, a review group under Professor Mortell is dealing with the issues he has raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has misinformed the House. Professor Mortell chairs the pharmacy review group and his work was ongoing when the Minister for Health and Children got a rush of blood to the head two weeks ago and deregulated the pharmacy industry. The industry was deregulated without the Minister knowing the recommendations of Professor Mortell's group, which was set up to advise on this matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach correct the record and then comment on the dangers that may arise because existing pharmacists say they may decide to refuse to sell medicine under Government contracts if the Government proceeds with the announcement made by the Minister for Health and Children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I correct Deputy Noonan. I have not misled the House. I know this is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children. The pharmacy review group was established by the Minister to examine, among other things, issues raised in relation to the operation of the consent procedure granting new community pharmacy contracts and last year's OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland. The terms of reference may be revised in light of current developments. That is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children, in conjunction with the chairman of the review group. As I stated, the group has been asked to respond as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting it did. The Minister acted on the advice of the Attorney General, that the statutory instruments regulating pharmacy location were <i>ultra vires</i> to the Health Act. There is very strong advice that the 1996 regulations were <i>ultra vires</i> which, in English, means beyond the powers of the Minister and were struck down. That is what happened in this case.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Noonan's question, the Minister is meeting the pharmacists' association to discuss a number of issues it has put in the public domain and I do not wish to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair may have to assist me as I am confused by the Taoiseach's reply. I refer to his reply to a similar question on 27 November 2001, when he said a high level review group on regulation was being established to give better coherence in implementing better regulation measures across the full spectrum of Government activities and that this would be done in certain areas of regulatory reform and highlight areas where further action is needed.</P>
      <P>This was back in November. If this group was to record the good progress made in certain areas of regulatory reform and to highlight certain other areas where further action was needed, one area would be the distribution of pharmacies and chemist shops. Was it consulted? It appears from the reply of 27 November 2001 that it should have been consulted or may have had a view to offer on further regulatory changes. If the group was not consulted, why was it not? The initial reply from the Taoiseach seems to suggest it had nothing to do with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have what I said previously, and the group is not involved in each legal issue that comes up. Regarding the reason the regulations were struck down as being <i>ultra vires</i>, there were challenges to the 1996 regulations. The statutory instrument relating to those regulations was challenged and the advice was that the matter was <i>ultra vires</i>, and the Minister changed it. There was no involvement from the regulatory reform group in that. The pharmacy review group obviously did not recommend this or have anything to do with it but it is doing a job in this area and is answerable to the Minister, so it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group in my Department will continue to examine regulations in that area and many others. Members will recall that the OECD report mentioned many areas but it stated that the pharmacy area required examination, not just because of the 1996 regulations being struck down but for <Col N="608" /> other reasons also. That was highlighted by the OECD in its examination of our systems.</P>
    <P>This group will examine regulations across the board and is not answerable to or working for the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say it was answerable to the Minister. It is a group established by the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The group deals with the implementation of regulations and is comprised of representatives of key Departments and independent sectoral regulators, agents and officers with a particular interest in the role of regulation such as Forfás, the Competition Authority and the Director of Consumer Affairs. I would have thought the Competition Authority and the Director of Consumer Affairs would have had a central role in the distribution of chemist shops. If the group is representative of such a broad range of interests and is accountable to the Taoiseach's Department, what is happening in Government when a decision is taken by the Minister for Health and Children and he does not have the courtesy, through the office of the Taoiseach, to check with this group as to whether the deregulation proposal he is to make would be in accord with the recommendations of the group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the normal system of governance that section would be aware of the decision of the Minister for Health and Children but it would have no influence over it. The Minister for Health and Children was told the regulations he was using to deal with pharmacies were <i>ultra vires</i> so the Minister could do nothing other than follow that advice. The regulatory group, which is working on the OECD issue, is examining some of the same areas but the court action has moved ahead of it. The group continues to deal with all the other issues but it is not consulted by each individual Department as to legalities. That is not its function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those regulations were drawn up in 1996 after consultation with the then Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson. The present Commissioner, David Byrne, did not seem to find anything wrong with those regulations when he was Attorney General. It was only when the current Attorney General took on a political role that the regulations suddenly became <i>ultra vires </i>as he went on one of his rants to deregulate the market.</P>
      <P>The point is that Professor Mortell's group was set up specifically to advise on this issue but it was not consulted. The Government has been in office for five years, but the Minister decided to have a run at it over the weekend.</P>

Does he accept that after five years in office there is an urgent need for the Government to act to deregulate the energy market?

We must honour commitments in the electricity and gas markets and in at least ten other areas under EU law. We are ahead of where we are required to be on most of those. The energy issue is one for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>EU Directive 96/92, which I presume is the one to which the Deputy referred, is being implemented by virtue of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and the European Communities internal market electricity regulations which provide the overall legislative framework for the development of the electricity sector. Ireland has gone beyond the requirements of the EU electricity directive by opening 31% of the market since February 2000. Market opening will rise to 40% on 19 February, which is next week, and will move to 100% by 2005. Consideration has been given to the feasibility of an interim step of 66% of the non-domestic market by the end of 2003. The markets for green electricity and for electricity from combined heat and power have been fully liberalised since February 2000 and April 2001, respectively. We are beyond where we are required to be. We will move over the short or medium term, depending on which decision is made, to full liberalisation.</P>

When the Gas Regulation Bill is passed, the powers of the regulator will be extended to deal with gas. Is there any interface <Col N="610" /> between the two areas? Does that body oversee the performance of the different regulators? I assure the Taoiseach it is less than impressive from the point of view of the telecommunications sector. Not one local loop has been unbundled after many promises. We are quickly losing our place in terms of technology. Our competitors are disappearing over the horizon while we are playing catch-up. The Taoiseach gave the figures for the electricity market, but most competitors who want to get into the market, such as E-Power, have been frightened off. Some 15 who would have loved to have become involved in the business of generating electricity have gone away because of the failure of the regulator to open up the market.</P>

It is being driven by the OECD and by the European Union to a lesser extent and, domestically, by the National Competitiveness Council. It is a new practice as we look into the future. We are the second country, as France was before us the previous year. With the restrictions on monetary policy and in other areas, it recognises that good and better regulation is a way for the country to gain competitiveness. It is endeavouring to examine the points made in the OECD report, to discuss those with the various agencies and Departments and to introduce a new national policy document. It hopes to issue by the end of February its view of its work since last April and then to open it up for discussion over the next three months until the end of May. It hopes to introduce a national document on regulation sometime in the autumn.</P>

I met the OECD officials a few times when they were here and they said it is not always an issue of deregulation. One is better off without regulation in some areas, while it is badly needed in others. It is not always a question of taking the market position, which normally states that regulation is not required. In other areas, such as those related to health and consumers, we should have regulation. That is what the group is doing. <Col N="611" /> There are senior officials on it from a number of Departments and from Forfás, the Competition Authority and the Director of Consumer Affairs as well as the regulators.

        <b>: </b>Is the Taoiseach aware that one of the recommendations of the high level group addressing the area of regulation is that henceforth in regard to the availability of animal medicines a farmer must go to a veterinary surgeon in order to get a prescription from a pharmacy for the remedy in question? There will be an obvious additional cost involved in going to the veterinary surgeon. This will also impinge on the custom of farmers preparing their own home-made medicines, which were not always in accordance with best practice. Is the Taoiseach concerned about this development and does he not accept that bringing in a restriction like this is the equivalent of requiring someone with a headache who wants an Anadin to go to the doctor to get a prescription for the pharmacist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the specifics of the question asked but better regulation is designed to ensure we do not have unnecessary regulations. It used to be called red tape and unless there is good reason we should not have too much regulation. As the Deputy knows, there are campaigns by consumer groups to bring in regulatory systems as to the use of a number of products. I agree that some areas are over-restricted while other areas may be in need of more <Col N="613" /> regulation. This is not an area that can be changed overnight and it will take time for new legislation to be put forward. The interest groups have an enormous attachment to this but they have to be broadened to include consumer groups who also share an interest in this area.</P>

        <b>: </b>The Taoiseach used two words that get to the nub of the problem &ndash;&ldquo;red tape&rdquo;. Does the Taoiseach agree it is the proliferation of red tape across a huge range of areas that has lead to business being stifled by the constant demands placed on it? In terms of the amount of form-filling alone, whether it be the agricultural sector, the service sector, the industrial sector or the most humble retail outlet, they are absolutely inundated with the current level required.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree this high level group should be investigating the possibility of reducing the amount of red tape? Does he agree that one of the key elements in determining how people voted on the Nice treaty was a resentment at the manner in which Brussels and its red tape and diktats were impinging on the lives of many people, particularly in the commercial sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of truth in what the Deputy said but it can work both ways. There is a number of important areas in Irish life where we have no regulation at all and where they would be dangerous. As the high level group stated, regulatory reform is a process of reviewing the regulatory structures and processes to ensure they promote efficiency in economic life. The term &ldquo;better regulation&rdquo; is used to reflect a broadened agenda of regulatory reform and is focused on more than administrative implications and red tape. I read the document produced by the group, which will come out in the next few days, and it echoes many of the issues raised by Deputy Higgins.</P>
      <P>Some of the points made in its regulatory checklist are whether the problem is correctly defined; whether Government action is justified; if regulation is the best form of Government action; an examination of alternatives such as economic instruments, voluntary agreements, self-regulation, information disclosure and persuasion of various types of performance-based regulation; if there is a real legal base for regulation; the appropriate level of Government to take action; if the benefits of regulation justify the costs; whether the distribution of effects across society is transparent; if the regulation is clear, consistent, comprehensive and accessible to users; if all interested parties had the opportunity to present their views; and how compliance will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some of the examples it gives, much of the time when legislation is brought in and put on the Statute Book, it is rarely altered. There is an enormous number of issues that have gone beyond what is necessary and this adds to the cost. In this debate there are those who say the <Col N="614" /> area of consumer interests in particular, such as food hygiene and safety, should be regulated.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy's point and when one goes through the current regulations and looks at regulatory assessments, as the high-level group is doing, it says the issue is about good regulation not deregulation. There is an economic advantage for countries that follow this practice and get rid of unnecessary bureaucracy, as the National Competitiveness Council pointed out a few years ago when the OECD got involved in this area. The report will be available to everyone in about a fortnight and the Deputies will see that it is not a short-term issue and will take some years to do, but it is a job worth doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the reason for that lies with the Rugby Football Union in England, which has done a lucrative deal with Sky Sports. This has been the case for the past few years and it is not the first time the issue has come up. The matches are not shown on the British broadcasting stations, nor on their national station. Therefore anyone who broadcasts them commercially has to pay the market value of the event. One cannot do that. If one tries to regulate for the home sports, the sporting bodies concerned will object because it deprives them of a source of income. The main point in this issue is that it is a deal between British rugby authorities and BSkyB.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach goes on to refer to pharmacies, liquor licences and telecommunications companies and states that once one touches on any of them there are difficulties because deregulation creates problems for the sectors involved. The Taoiseach said that is why vested interests in these sectors must be given the opportunity to argue their cases and outline how deregulation will work against the consumer. He said that on 27 November and specifically cited pharmacies. His reply goes on to refer in some detail to the fact that the group was set up in August, yet he suggests &ndash; or inadvertently gives the impression &ndash; that the courts found that pharmacy regulations were <i>ultra vires</i>. It was the president of the Progressive Democrats who discovered that. The Taoiseach goes on to state that, therefore, the Minister had no choice but to present everyone with a <i>fait accompli</i> and that he had nothing to do with it. How does he square that with his view that affected groups are entitled to be consulted and that they will trenchantly argue their cases? There seems to be a contradiction between the Taoiseach's reply of 27 November and what the president of the Progressive Democrats decided in his full-time &ndash; or part-time &ndash; capacity as Attorney General, which led to what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, did. The Taoiseach was not involved, even though he is responsible for regulation and for the administration of this report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for regulation in the pharmacy sector, the Minister for Health and Children is responsible for that sector. That is why we are talking about the health regulations of 1996. In this case there were a number of challenges to that. The advice of the Attorney General to the Minister was that he was acting <i>ultra vires</i> and that if those cases were fought they would not be won. I am not going to comment on that. The Deputy may put down questions to the Minister for Health and Children if he wants to know the advice he got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am responsible for the OECD report. I said the pharmacy sector was one of those sectors highlighted by the OECD as being in need of regulatory reform. In its report on regulatory reform in Ireland, the OECD suggested that reform of some of the pharmacy regulations <Col N="616" /> could bring about lower prices and more efficient provision of services. It raised two main issues, the first being the restrictions under the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations 1996 on location and the number of pharmacies that hold community pharmacy contracts. These regulations introduced, among other things, a system for granting community pharmacy contracts to supply reimbursable prescription medicines under the GMS system and community drug schemes. This is not a system of licensed pharmacists, since any person who meets the legal requirements of the pharmacy Acts may open a pharmacy. However, the level of business covered by the GMS means it would be difficult to establish a pharmacy without a contract. Various court cases have arisen in connection with these regulations.</P>
    <P>The second issue mentioned is the restriction on pharmacists educated in other countries under the derogation incorporated in Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC on movement of pharmacists managing or supervising a pharmacy. The directive has been in existence for less than three years and the OECD recommended that this restriction be eliminated. The review group, which is reporting to me, at its first meeting on 2 November last, included in its terms of reference assessing and responding to the OECD's recommendations relating to restrictions on EU trained pharmacists and assessment of restrictions on location and numbers of pharmacies.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan rightly said, the pharmacy review group, chaired by Dr. Michael Mortell, is already in operation and is considering changing its terms of reference due to the changes the Minister has made following on the legal advice from the Attorney General. There is no contradiction or confusion.</P>

He went on to state that they would argue their cases trenchantly, because there could be consumer interests involved. I am trying to understand the system of decision making in a Cabinet for which the Taoiseach has total responsibility. When the Attorney General came to the decision that the legal action initiated would provoke a court judgment that the regulations in question were <i>ultra vires</i>, did anybody consult the Taoiseach, since he had already described his responsibility with regard to the OECD report? Did anybody pick up the point, clearly made by the Taoiseach, that bodies affected were entitled to be consulted? Was any attempt made by the Minister for Health and Children to consult the Irish Pharmaceutical Union prior to what appears to be his decision to unilaterally deregulate the pharmacy sector?

There is a high level group on regulation trying to plan, organise and deal with things for the future. As the Deputy knows well, they are not entitled to cut across current legal action. The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations of 1996, Statutory Instrument 152 of 1996, set out the criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts.</P>
      <P>During the course of the legal challenges, which have been going on almost continually since 1996, the Minister for Health and Children sought the advice of the office of the Attorney General on the legal basis of regulations and the advice he received concluded that the regulations were <i>ultra vires</i>. It happened in the middle of a court case. When something is being arbitrated it is not a matter of going off consulting bodies on the fact that what one is trying to defend is <i>ultra vires</i>. That is what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" />They are not OECD regulations. They are our own regulatory regime which we are now trying to update and modernise. I ask the Deputy to stop trying to confuse them with current legal cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>On 17 January 2002, I authorised my Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations, Inc., Connecticut, USA, for the purchase of three medium range helicopters &ndash; S-92s &ndash; for search and rescue purposes, with an option capable of being exercised within three years for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport. The decision followed from a detailed examination of the tenders received from the four companies: Sikorsky, USA; CHC Scotia, Scotland; E.H. Industries Ltd.; UK and Eurocopter, France.</P>
      <P>The offer from Sikorsky was deemed to be the most strategically and economically advantageous tender taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition, which were: functional characteristics; technical merit; all maintenance and on-line technical support; after sales service and warranty terms on offer; cost and ready availability of spare parts; tender prices; and life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" />I am satisfied, on the basis of the facts presented to me, that the offer from Sikorsky would provide best value for money from the taxpayers point of view. The time frame proposed by Sikorsky would see the delivery of three search and rescue helicopters by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Legal proceedings have been instituted on behalf of one of the unsuccessful tenderers and correspondence has been received from solicitors acting on behalf of another of the unsuccessful tenderers. My Department is dealing with the Chief State Solicitor's office on these matters.</P>
    <P>Eurocopter has obtained leave to institute judicial review proceedings in the High Court seeking the disclosure of certain information. It is my intention to be as forthcoming as possible in this regard. However, as the matter is due to come before the court shortly I do not wish to say anything further at this stage.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the offer from Sikorsky was deemed to be the most strategically and economically advantageous tender taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition. No other factors were taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the Eurocopter Cougar helicopter, as opposed to the Sikorsky S92, was the preferred choice of the expert group he appointed to assess the tenders? Could he indicate the way in which the Sikorsky helicopter was the strategically and economically better product to acquire and why it is preferred? Could he confirm that the reason for the court proceedings is the failure of his Department to comply with reasonable speed to a Freedom of Information Act request made regarding the tendering processes and documentation relating thereto? Is he in a position to confirm that Eurocopter has threatened to issue a High Court injunction which could prevent the current negotiations with Sikorsky progressing and which could substantially delay the delivery of the helicopters which the Defence Forces, and particularly the Air Corps, so badly require?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The answer to the second question is that the civil and military procurement group and the technical exercise that was necessary to evaluate everything concerned with the different options, proposals and tenders was very detailed and comprehensive. I have no doubt the people involved in that process carried out that exercise with the utmost integrity and that the final decision, which I took, was based on the best possible deal for the taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I do not control matters relating to what an unsuccessful tenderer might do or require. These are matters, which Deputy Shatter well knows, which would be handled by the Chief State Solicitor and not by me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Eurocopter offer, they were asked after the tender process for a best and final offer. Could the Minister explain to the House why the company was asked for a final offer, considering that it had gone through the tender process? One would think it was an auction, that they were asked for the best and final offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the complexities involved in a project of this size, the biggest contract my Department has ever undertaken. Securing the best possible result necessitated a long and detailed analysis of very complex proposals, which had to be checked again and again with the manufacturers. By the time this work was heading towards its completion, the tender prices were out of date. As the Deputy will probably be aware, a tender, when submitted, is effective generally for two months, sometimes longer, but quite a number of those were out of date at that time.</P>
      <P>Second, arising from the horrific events of 11 September there were strong international indicators that the prices in the aircraft market generally might be different in a new situation. I am obliged once the tenders are out of date to conduct a final tender process and on my own judgment, to see whether there were savings which my Department could make in a changed international situation, and that is what I have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify was it his judgment that Sikorsky was the preferred tenderer or was it the judgment of the expert group as well? Second, is he satisfied that he has properly complied with the European Union competition law and is he concerned to ensure that this matter is progressed in a uncontentious way in so far as that is possible? Can he indicate to the House when his Department received Freedom of Information Act requests for documentation from either one or both of the unsuccessful tenderers and why those requests have not yet been complied with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the second question is that my decision was taken on 17 January, which was only just a couple of weeks ago. Following on that, there were certain requests and there are a number to which I have replied through the Chief State Solicitor. I am not aware that there is anything which has been requested of me that I need to do in respect of that and certainly if there is, I would be very happy to do it.</P>
      <P>I stand over any decisions I have taken in this regard. The buck stops with me on decisions in the final analysis. I take the final decisions. Naturally I would base that decision on a raft of different proposals which would be made to me in the context of the examination that was carried out. I see technical merit, delivery date and, of course, price to be the determining factors in such a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied this was dealt with in a manner fully compliant with European Union competition law? Perhaps the Minister will give a straightforward answer as to whether the decision he made is contrary to the recommendation from the expert group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question. I am perfectly happy that the decisions which were taken will stand up to the most rigorous scrutiny in any court under any European regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the assessment of the three craft, did the expert group visit the manufacturing premises of the three companies? Was visual and working experience of the three gained by the group? The media have put a lot of focus on the offset element of the deal and claimed it played a major part in the granting of the contracts. Regarding the offset, how many representations did the Minister receive from the political arena? Were IBEC or ICTU involved? Who else was involved in making representations to the Department on the basis that if a particular contract was accepted there would be a benefit to the north Dublin community and further contracts awarded to a particular company? This has been in the newspapers both before and after the decision and it has now lead to litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first question is yes, the technical group would take all of these matters into consideration. Each of the four tenders met the technical requirements set out in the tender. I was, of course, aware of the offset proposals. Quite a number of representations were made, directly and indirectly, to me by at least two of the tendering companies. One said it would compete with the other in offset deals should it succeed in getting the contract. However, I cannot take matters like that into consideration. I am obliged to abide by the rules which were set out in the tendering process and treat all of the tenders equally. The conditions known to them at the start of the competition had to be adhered to until the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of Defence Forces' participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review. Requests from the UN for Irish participation in new missions are considered on a case by case basis within the context of the United Nations stand-by arrangement system &ndash; UNSAS. As I indicated to the House in October 1998, Ireland signed a memorandum of under<Col N="622" /> standing with the United Nations in relation to UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under this system. However, there would be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the despatch of a contingent to a specific operation.</P>
      <P>The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations. There exists a standing interdepartmental committee on peacekeeping under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Its function, <i>inter alia,</i> is to provide a forum for the exchange of views on policy issues relating to Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping with a view to increasing the effectiveness and coherence of policy and to ensure the implementation of it can keep apace in a co-ordinated way with developments in international peacekeeping.</P>
      <P>On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386, under chapter VII of the UN Charter, authorising the deployment of an international security assistance force &ndash; ISAF &ndash; in Afghanistan for six months. Its objective is to assist in the maintenance of security in Kabul and the surrounding areas, so that the Afghan Interim Authority and United Nations personnel can operate in a secure environment. Acting under chapter VII of the UN Charter means that the ISAF &ndash; whose lead nation is the United Kingdom &ndash; is authorised to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate.</P>
      <P>Discussions at the UN Security Council continue to focus on Afghanistan, especially on the issues of security and the possible extension of ISAF outside Kabul. On 6 February 2002, a full day of meetings on Afghanistan took place, including briefings by both the Secretary General and special representative, Ambassador Brahimi. It is not possible at this stage to say exactly how the UN's role in Afghanistan will develop. The question of the possible deployment of Defence Forces personnel to a UN peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan does not arise at this stage.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information.</i>There has been no significant EU discussion of participation in the international security assistance force. It is understood that all other EU member states intend to contribute to the mission. Should Ireland decide to participate in ISAF, Government and Dáil approval would be required and full account would be taken of the security situation in the area, the mandate of the mission and further factors such as the equipment and skills necessary for the mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that members of an interim government in Afghanistan have expressed the desire that a multinational peacekeeping force continue to play a role there? Does the Minister agree that in that context, and in the interests of stabilising that country, it <Col N="623" /> would be desirable that the UN resolution in place for six months be extended? Does he acknowledge that there is a view within the international community that the troops provided under a UN mandate should be more diverse than those currently there? Does he agree that the State, through the Defence Forces, could play a beneficial role in Afghanistan in helping ensure democracy becomes a reality and stability becomes the norm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter. Our contribution under UN mandates in many different places has helped us develop considerable experience in peacekeeping, crisis management and humanitarian tasks. I have not received a specific request from the UN. Should that happen, the matter would have to come before the Dáil and we would have to send a team to engage in reconnaissance and to check security conditions. Although I cannot speak for the Government or this House, if that request were forthcoming, I anticipate that we would be able to support and contribute to bringing a sense of normality to that part of the world where there has been so much trauma, tragedy and torment. Support is needed to build up the country and to support the NGOs in the task of distributing food and helping local communities. I have no argument with the points raised by Deputy Shatter and look forward to having the opportunity to assess our position in the proper way once the UN makes a request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I launched the Defence Forces recruitment campaign yesterday. The main purpose of this two year campaign is to promote the role of the Defence Forces and to highlight the variety of rewarding career opportunities available in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. The cross-media campaign will include radio, press, television, cinema and Internet advertisements and will involve expenditure of up to &euro;2.5 million over two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a tender competition conducted by the military authorities, the contract was awarded to Cawley Nea advertising agency in October last. A considerable amount of work was done in late 2001 in preparation for the campaign. A special project team was formed from the Defence Forces public relations and personnel sections to co-ordinate the campaign with the advertising agency. The joint project team visited many locations throughout the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and also travelled to Kosovo and East Timor where Irish troops participate as part <Col N="624" /> of international peace support missions mandated by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>To date over &euro;1.1 million has been spent in production and development costs. Advertising slots have been bought for appropriate advertising times, including during this year's World Cup competition. There has also been a comprehensive overhaul of all recruitment information literature and application booklets.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity to visit many of the military barracks and posts and have seen at first hand the positive and morale boosting effect new recruits have on these installations. I am confident this campaign will be successful in encouraging many more young people to follow a career in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the United Nations introduced an international ban yesterday on the use of child soldiers who are defined as children under 18? In light of this, has he any plans to change the recruitment age into the Defence Forces? Does the Minister also agree that the recruitment age of 17 may encourage people to leave school early? As a result of transition year, the age at which children leave school has increased recently. The recruitment age to the Defence Forces may be an incentive to children to leave the education system too early. How many recruits is it intended to take in and how many applications have there been to date? Is there a waiting list of people seeking entry to the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, Deputy Timmins gets the most out of a supplementary question. I will try to cover as much as I can. We expect in general enlistment to recruit about 800 this year. We will also require 60 cadets and about 40 others in the Air Corps, Naval Service and as specialist doctors, dentists, engineers, watchkeepers and so on. The total figure is between 900 and 1,000.</P>
      <P>I agree with the overall thrust of the recruitment convention and do not intend to violate its substance. There is no comparison between press-ganging ten to 14 year olds into war-like situations in Sierra Leone and Liberia and the very responsible programme operated by the Defence Forces since its foundation. Applicants must be 17 and will not perform domestic operational and overseas duties until they are 18. Apprentices are recruited at the normal apprenticeship age and can spend up to four years training. They could be 20 years old or more before they would have an opportunity to engage in operational duties in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Timmins knows that much of the work done in the first year offers opportunities for continuing education and training. That is why some Defence Forces personnel who leave quickly are so attractive to the private sector. The training and other opportunities in the Defence Forces are very good in character. About 22% of recruits to the Defence Forces are between 17 and 18. A good number of these would be 17 and a half or <Col N="625" /> nearer to 18. I cannot give overall statistics but it is not the case that they would be just 17. Those who join aged between 17 and 18 require parents' or a guardian's permission. It is a different scenario.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>My impression is that soldiers younger than 18 have carried out domestic operational duties, although I do not have any direct evidence of that. Will the Minister check that as well as whether any personnel younger than 18 have served overseas? I believe it is possible that may have happened.</P>
      <P>Between March and September last year, 520 people enlisted in the Defence Forces, but by December, 25% had left. Has the Minister examined the reason this happened and has he taken any measures to ensure there will not be a recurrence? It is a waste of money funding equipment for these people if they leave after a few short months. Does the Minister appear in the advertising campaign at any stage?</P>

      <P>There are always waiting lists of people wanting to enlist in the Defence Forces.

Active consideration is being given to examining this because there may well be elements which belong to the past and for which there is no need now with so many opportunities for education for young people. A good number will have completed their leaving certificate by the time they decide to enlist. It is something of which we are taking cognisance.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to the previous question, I attended the launch of the Defence Forces recruitment advertising campaign yesterday. I expect this campaign, which is designed to attract applicants to careers in the <Col N="626" /> Defence Forces generally, to increase the numbers seeking careers in the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>In the past four years, a total of 331 personnel have been inducted into the Naval Service, including 58 cadets and officers, 21 apprentices and 248 enlisted personnel. It is expected the recruitment campaign will target vacancies throughout the Naval Service in the coming year with up to 100 personnel of all ranks being recruited this year. This figure will include general service recruits, cadets and the appointment and enlistment of suitably qualified technical personnel, including watchkeeping officers, marine engineer officers, electrical engineering officers, electrical artificers and engine room artificers. In addition, a number of enlisted personnel will be given the opportunity to apply for commissioning as officers in the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>In the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that an updated integrated Defence Forces personnel management plan would be prepared by military management as a matter of priority. It would set down policies and goals to ensure that personnel policies and practices kept pace with the best practice to the benefit of the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service. The proposed integrated personnel management plan, which is being prepared by the Chief of Staff, will address the issues raised by the Deputy relating to the Naval Service and will establish a comprehensive intake policy and active personnel management framework to address requirements in the coming decade.</P>
      <P>The new organisation for the Naval Service which I approved in December 2000 provides for an increased total of 1,144 personnel as follows: 189 officers, 537 NCOs and 418 seamen. The strength of the Naval Service at 31 December last was 951 and comprised 132 officers or cadets, 426 NCOs and 393 seamen. The recruitment campaign will address the normal turnover of personnel together with the need to take account of the increase in Naval Service personnel in the new organisation.</P>

      <P>I will try to obtain that specific information for the Deputy. There is provision for the appointment of 115 watchkeepers with 75 in service and 23 at various levels of training. There is provision for the appointment of 32 marine engineer officers with 16 in service and eight at various levels of training. There is provision for 13 appointments as electrical engineers, four are currently serving and a competition to recruit graduate electronic engineers was advertised in recent weeks. There is provision for the appointment of 85 engine room artificers, 63 are currently serving and a further 30 are at various levels of training. There is provision for a total of 48 <Col N="627" /> electrical artificers, 28 are currently serving and 24 are at various levels of training. There is a total of 23 shipwright hull artificers, 16 are currently serving and ten are at various levels of training. There are 29 radio radar technicians, 14 are currently serving and a further ten are at various levels of training.</P>
      <P>While the establishment figure is down Deputies can see that the flag officers and the Naval Service generally are trying to build up numbers. The service has been able to maintain its fishery protection vessels and has been able to send a ship to China. The service is short in some specialist areas and I accept advice on quick entry to areas where specific problems exist. The workload is being maintained and requirements are being met. The intake from this year's recruitment campaign should be approximately 100 and careful management will ensure that newly trained personnel fill areas where there are shortages.</P>

      <P>I look forward to the Minister sending me information regarding vacancies and the number of people who joined the service and subsequently left it. Does the Minister agree that the sea-going time is an increasingly important factor in people not remaining in the naval service? </P>
      <P>Is the National Minimum Wage Act complied with in the naval service? When naval personnel are aboard ship they are on duty at all times. Are they paid in compliance with the Act at all times?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the minimum wage legislation needs to be applied to Defence Forces personnel. They are considerably above that level.</P>
      <P>We are different from other countries in our desire to come home quickly from sea. People in other countries appear to be able to withstand voyages of long duration away from home. This is a major consideration for personnel and their families. There is no easy solution to this problem, but filling our numbers to the best possible extent at least means that periods at sea are rotated. Interestingly, we have had a number of applicants from the midlands&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, the Reserve Defence Forces review implementation board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the reserve steering group. I established the special steering group in 1998 to undertake a study of the reserve and the group reported to me in September 1999. Under the aegis of the military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have advised that the process of formulating revised structures for the Reserve Defence Force is ongoing and the draft Reserve Defence Forces review implementation board report is expected to be submitted to the Chief of Staff shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation <Col N="629" /> of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, an important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that members of the FCA should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to suitable qualifications, personal availability and appropriate advance training. Service by reservists on overseas peace support missions in other countries is quite common. General criteria governing selection for overseas service come within the scope of representation, and any matters relating to overseas service by members of the reserve which come within the scope of representation will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. The question of the security of civilian employment for the members of the reserve who may wish to serve overseas will be considered as part of the implementation process. Accordingly, pending completion of the implementation plan, applications to serve overseas have not been received from members of the reserve.</P>
    <P>The report of the special steering group indicated that the existing first line reserve system satisfactorily addresses any Air Corps Reserve aviation requirement. Former Air Corps personnel who volunteer for service on the first line reserve or who have a first line reserve commitment should be attached to an appropriate unit of the Air Corps. The steering group did not recommend that any special reserve unit or formation be established specifically for the Air Corps. The question of aviation training for members of the general Army Reserve should not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the Naval Service Reserve, An Slua Muirí, is 25 officers, 42 non-commissioned officers and 108 seamen.</P>
    <P>In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can participate in the planning and management of reserve activities at the highest level in brigade headquarters and the Defence <Col N="630" /> Forces training centre, the steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenent-colonel appointments. It is intended that these appointments will form part of the integrated element of the reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments would hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these appointments has not yet been established, it will form part of the implementation process also.</P>
    <P>The steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the plans for the future of the reserve have been ongoing for a number of years? Can he tell the House when we might see the implementation of these plans? Can he tell people who are serving in the reserve when they might see integration happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of aspects to the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Forces. The implementation plan will be spread over a six year period. I expect to have the plan by the end of this year. In the interim, equipment, accommodation, Steyr rifles, uniforms and so on are being provided. The new uniforms for a number of FCA members will be available by St. Patrick's Day this year and the Steyr rifles are already in the course of delivery. We are also improving accommodation. That is as much as can be done this year but I expect to have the plan by the end of the year and things will begin to happen from then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the overseas aspect, is it correct that there has been no applications in this regard? From talking to members of the FCA, it is my view that they see that as the ultimate. Will that be feasible under the restructuring and training which is taking place on the ground? Does the Minister see that as being the ultimate? Many young people are interested in joining the FCA. On Tuesday and Thursday nights young people from south Kildare can be seen preparing to leave for the base in Portlaoise. Obviously these young people are interested in the FCA. Will the overseas aspect become a reality in the short-term? I accept what the Minister has said in regard to organisation and the need for better equipment and a more structured position. However, at the end of the day, these young people want to put their training into action. Does the Minister see that happening next year or what is the timeframe in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="631" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to that question. First, Deputy Wall knows we have stepped up on training. I inherited a situation where there was just one week's training. That has been increased to 14 days. The man days has been increased from 70,000 to 90,000 last year to 100,000 this year. The opportunity for training has been greatly increased. When I introduced the White Paper it was hoped we might see the first recruits, subject to qualifications, availability and so on, going on overseas duty this year. I do not know whether that target can be reached. I hoped it would happen within two years on the basis that there might be at least a number of specialists in some of the areas where we already have some difficulty in fulfilling our missions and that I would have a real opportunity to move quickly on that issue.</P>
      <P>The second question relates to the integrated reserve where there would have to be considerable training to bring people up to the level required to go to the missions. I hoped the opportunity would present itself a little earlier on the specialist side. It is a blueprint in the White Paper. It is something we will do and, needless to say, it would be fantastic from a morale point of view for some people in the reserve. As I said earlier, this is normal in many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the new recruitment campaign also aimed at recruitment into the FCA? Has the Minister taken steps to encourage female recruitment <i>vis-à-vis</i> the height requirement? Does he propose to abolish the height requirement for males and females entering the Defence Forces? Given that it has been done by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it seems logical and reasonable that he might take that innovative step. Is he concerned that many officers have left the Permanent Defence Forces in recent years, many of whom have intimated they wish to join the Reserve Defence Forces? Is he concerned, due to the fact that the report has been left on the shelf for so long that many of these people may lose interest and move on?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the shortage of specialists going overseas. I assume he is talking about doctors and engineers. Have any of these specialists been detailed to go overseas against their wishes in recent years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems Deputy Timmins has some way of listening to me when I am dealing privately with some of the senior people in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>The height requirement was discussed in the last couple of weeks. As the Deputy will be aware, I decreased the height requirement for females and found that I had run into trouble on the basis of equality. Therefore, it was necessary to decrease the height for men to the same <Col N="632" /> level to meet those requirements. This is ridiculous, but I am required to do so.</P>
      <P>In view of very strong advice from the medical personnel in the Defence Forces in regard to training requirements, weight and so on which must be carried, I must, for the time being at least, adhere to the current height requirements. However, it is something which will be reviewed in due course. In view of potential injury, particularly spinal injury, I must take full account of the advice given to me.</P>
      <P>I will consider the issue of facilitating older members of the FCA. The recruitment campaign will aim primarily at getting people into the Permanent Defence Forces. I will see to what extent that can help on the reserve side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister addressed the shortage of specialists and whether any of them were detailed to serve overseas in recent years.</P>
      <P>On the height issue, does he agree that if the same height requirement is necessary for males and females, based on the fact that the average height of a male is greater than the average height of a female, there is an equality issue <i>vis-à-vis</i> males in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Timmins knows well that I agree completely with him on that issue. He asked me a few years ago whether I would examine this. I did so and reduced the height requirement for females. I then found I had another problem on my hands and I had to adjust it again. It is ridiculous. However, that is part and parcel of the world in which we live. The language I am now using should probably be used rather sparingly. It is how I feel about the matter. I felt there was an inequality because females are generally smaller than men and I believed that aspect should be taken into account. However, that is the current position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say the expert group did not see any point in having the FCA involved in preliminary training to fly aircraft or the possibility of creating an interest in the FCA in regard to the Air Corps? As we know there are problems retaining personnel in the Air Corps. Young members who join the FCA might find it exciting if there was a possibility they could join the Air Corps. Is it true there is no substance to providing that as an extra incentive to people to join the FCA or to try to link the FCA with the Air Corps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to consider that in light of what the Deputy has said. However, we must bear in mind that some of the areas to which he referred involve not just part-time activities. Even those who are full-time have very strenuous retraining schedules and so on. While I do not want to get away from the reality, I will sympathetically consider some aspects.</P>

      <P>It could be difficult to find a home for it, a matter we will deal with another time. In terms of the consultative process, opening up the integrated reserve, approving accommodation, better equipment and uniforms, I accept that we have more to do. There are pressures on the young people concerned as well as on the members of the reserves. They have full-time jobs and are not getting as much time off because pressure is exerted on them to stay where they are &ndash; the pressure may not have been as keen before. Within those limits and in the consultative process with the RDFRA, I will hear what suggestions they are making. The geographical base is very varied in which there may well be something useful.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" />Ireland's approach to participation in PfP was set out in our presentation document of 1 December 1999, which outlined our five priority areas of participation as: co-operation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment; and co-operation in marine matters. Ireland's first individual partnership programme, IPP, covered the period up to 31 December 2001 and included some 89 activities, consisting mainly of training courses, seminars, conferences and table top exercises. The cost of participation was in the order of &euro;343,000, of which some &euro;317,000 related to the activities proposed for the Defence Forces, the remainder relating to the civil element of the Department, including Civil Defence elements. The cost of the 2001 IPP was met from within existing resources.</P>
    <P>Ireland's second IPP, covering the period 2002-2003, has been drawn up on the basis of experience gained with the initial IPP and continues to give practical content to the overall priorities identified in the presentation document. This second IPP contains a total of 125 activities to be undertaken by the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, civil staffs from the Department of Defence, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Participation in PfP activities is entirely voluntary and based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation. In accordance with this fundamental principle, all decisions regarding the content and form of the IPP for 2002-03 have been made by the Irish authorities. As had been done with the IPP for 2001, details of the IPP activities for 2002-03, which allow for adjustment based on policy development and the availability of financial and other resources, will shortly be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The activities chosen focus on the enhancement of current skills and expertise in such areas as operational and generic planning for peacekeeping and peace support, communications, command and control, operational procedures and logistics and consist of training courses, workshops, seminars and table top exercises. They do not involve military manoeuvres or large-scale military exercises.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined PfP's planning and review process, PARP, in May 2001, and our partnership goals have been chosen with a view towards enhancing interoperability with our PfP partners in such areas as tactics, operational cohesion, logistics and language training. Ireland, in common with other neutral EU member states that are members of PfP, participates in the PARP mechanism for the purpose of planning in respect of the EU headline goal. The aim is to create the conditions in which different contingents can work together efficiently and effectively. Ireland wishes to contribute its UN peacekeeping experience by playing an active part in humanitarian, <Col N="635" /> rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks &ndash; the Petersberg tasks &ndash; in support of the European Union's CFSP. Ireland sees PfP, in general, and the PARP, in particular, as having a significant role to play in co-operation and planning for participation in such tasks.</P>
    <P>The training opportunities provided by Ireland's participation in PfP will further enhance the development of the Defence Forces consistent with the objectives of the Government White Paper on Defence published in February 2000.</P>

      <P>This one did it as concisely as it could manage. On the one hand, there was a story that SIPTU was about to ballot its members who work in the accident and emergency departments of hospitals to see if they were willing to take industrial action because of what it described as Third World conditions. On the other, there was a debate about a significant tax break being given to millionaire sportsmen. I thought to myself that one could hardly sum it up more neatly than that. If one happens to have a few bob in the bank and wants a significant tax break, then Charlie is your man, but if one happens to be an unfortunate citizen knocking on the door of an accident and emergency department, waiting for four or five hours at a time, one cannot expect reasonable conditions. Neither can one expect to get payment or investment in reasonable conditions at work if one works in the accident and emergency department of one of our hospitals. That says all one needs to know about Deputy McCreevy's tenure as Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell in his contribution this morning said something about the state of the economy. I do not want to dwell on that issue, but perhaps it bears some comment. The Minister for Finance projected 3.5% growth in GNP in his Budget Statement in December. The reality is that, in the past six months or so, we have had no growth at all. The Central Bank, with which I concur, estimates that the economy is currently flat. It will require a significant improvement in the second half of this year if we are to meet even the pretty limited ambitions the Minister set in his Budget Statement at the start of December. I am not yet willing to say we will not meet those targets. I sincerely hope we do and that the optimists are proved right, that the American economy recovers and that that recovery will have a spin-off effect in Europe, particularly in Ireland. I hope sectors such as the telecom one that have had such a bad time in the past year will recover. However, at this stage there are no signs of it. <Col N="637" /> The Exchequer returns for January are discouraging and for the moment there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Having said that, it is too early to start pushing the panic button, but we must keep a close eye on this from month to month as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is primarily intended to give effect to the tax changes announced on budget day. Just over two years ago when the PPF was initially negotiated between this Government and the social partners, I said the Minister for Finance was making three different types of tax commitments, which were in part incompatible and certainly could not be delivered in full. The Minister committed to completing his own pet project, tax individualisation; he committed to reducing the upper and lower rates of income tax and he committed to attempting to bring those on the national minimum wage out of the income tax net.</P>
    <P>Unsurprisingly, the Minister succeeded in reducing the tax rates to the level he wanted and I have no doubt that as he sails off into the sunset he will probably beat his breast and consider he has done a good job on that score. As I have said many times in the past, I would not have done it in the way he has, but at least it was mandated by the people. The individualisation of tax was very much the Minister's pet project and one that benefited married couples with both partners working and therefore necessarily introduced a discrimination into the system against one income married couples. I disagreed with that and I still do. The State should be neutral as regards people's preferences as to whether both partners work and in so far as there is a bias, we should support the family in giving people the option of staying at home to look after their children.</P>
    <P>My primary gripe is that the Minister has not fulfilled the promise to take those on the national minimum wage out of the tax net. There is a point about this that I missed on budget day. On doing the maths and reviewing the amount of money he dispensed and the amount of tax foregone on budget day, it was perfectly possible within his budgetary strategy to do it. Some &euro;223 million was foregone on individualisation. If that had been put into taking people on the national minimum wage out of the income tax net, he could have done that. Instead he chose unsurprisingly to use that &euro;223 million to push further his own pet project of individualisation. When the Taoiseach, Tánaiste or Minister say they would like to have gone the full way and take people on the national minimum wage out of the tax net, we should all know this possibility was open to him, but he chose not to do so and I deplore that.</P>
    <P>The Minister reviewed his tax record during his speech today just as he did at the press conference he gave last week. He is fond of trotting out a number of figures that suggest he has been the most equitable and generous Minister for Finance ever. He has skewed his tax cuts to benefit the better off and those paying the higher rate of tax on part of their income have benefited to an <Col N="638" /> unfair extent from the tax cuts introduced by the Minister. The amount of tax foregone in the past five years by the Minister comes to about &euro;7 billion, which is not a small amount. That was broken down as follows: some 43% went on increasing personal tax credits, which benefits all taxpayers; some 16% went on cutting the standard rate of tax, which benefits everyone who pays tax and not just those who pay tax only at the standard rate; some 22% went on increasing the standard rate band, which obviously by definition only benefits those paying the higher rate; and some 11% went in reducing the upper rate which is only of benefit to those who pay the upper rate. This means one third of those total tax concessions went exclusively to people on the higher rate and of the remainder a substantial proportion was also enjoyed by those who pay tax at the higher rate.</P>
    <P>The case is conclusive. During this Minister's five years in the Department of Finance, those on the highest rate who needed tax relief least, benefited most. I accept the income tax burden five years ago was higher than most of us find ideal and there was every justification for reducing it. However this should have been done in a much fairer way. This was not an accident and something that happened just because he was in Government with the Progressive Democrats; it was the personal choice and personal project of this Minister, which I deplore.</P>
    <P>Public services are a matter of priority for my party and me. Over the weekend, I listened with interest to Deputy O'Malley. I have read commentaries recently to the effect that we are currently spending too much and that the increase of 20% in expenditure last year and the somewhat reduced figure this year are simply unaffordable. I understand the viewpoint of those commentators. Given an expected growth rate of 3.5% in the economy, the prospect of current expenditure increasing by a multiple of that is not very comforting. However if we do not put this into some perspective, the argument becomes badly skewed.</P>
    <P>By European standards we are starting from a very low base of investment in current services. The level of investment in current services by Ireland in the past five, seven or eight years is one of the lowest in the European Union and one of the lowest in the OECD, bar the United States of America. For the first three years of this Government, the Minister stood fairly rigidly to his 4% target even though he may have tweaked the figures somewhat. More realistically he could be said to have stuck to a 6% year on year increase in current expenditure. At the time we were growing most we were not investing at a pace that matched growth. To put it another way, the benefits of growth at that time and for most of the period of this Government have not been going into public services. They have been going into surpluses or into people's back pockets. That was simply a wrong choice of priorities.</P>
    <P>Much of the increase in public expenditure over the past four or five years has gone into pub<Col N="639" /> lic service pay. I understand why that is the case. We need well-motivated well-paid public servants and there was no way to avoid this increase. In the health service, most of us understood and supported the case made by the nurses and the one now being made by the junior hospital doctors. Nonetheless 60% of the increased expenditure on the health service over the past four or five years has gone into pay and has not necessarily led to any significant improvement in or extension to the service provided with the money, which is regrettable. It is a well-worn theme of mine that we need to expand, improve and spend more money on services. However, we can only persuade the public to increase spending by persuading them they will get a better service for it. While we need well-motivated well-paid public servants, we also need to ensure that more money means better service and more service.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of public expenditure by this House and in general has disimproved and has not met the standards required. I recently read an independent assessment of our public expenditure that makes it clear there has not been the political commitment to ensure we get value for money. If we are to make the case for sustained investment in public services as my party and I do, we will need much improved systems of ensuring we get value for money.</P>
    <P>If we examine the health strategy which is probably the best case in point, we will get a clear picture of the magnitude of the task we face in seeking to improve public services over the next few years and perhaps an even clearer and somewhat frightening picture of the cost entailed in that strategy. I accept that the capacity improvements spelled out in the health strategy are, broadly speaking, in line with what is needed. There is no reason to dispute the figures. We are talking about 3,000 extra acute beds, 5,000 additional residential places, additional step-down facilities, community care facilities, primary care facilities, clinics and so on. It is a major task, having regard to only the capital side of the argument.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Department of Finance or the Department of Health and Children compiled the figures, but whoever did so calculated that the additional cost to the Exchequer of implementing the health strategy was some £10,000 million, &euro;13,000 million, over ten years. That is in addition to the &euro;2,500 million being provided in the context of the NDP and to the normal, no policy change, year on year increases in expenditure that will be required in any event. When that is combined, the challenge it presents to the Exchequer and to all of us in this House, if we are genuinely committed to increasing the capacity of the service in the way we say we are, is frightening and enormous.</P>
    <P>Let there be no mistake about it, we need to increase capacity. Ten to 12 years ago we had 3,000 more acute beds within the system than we currently have. Everybody accepts we need to <Col N="640" /> increase the number of beds, but that will cost money and large amounts of it. The Labour Party is committed to finding that money. If it is a participant in the next Government, I am determined that such money will be found and that we will make that investment. If we do not, we will fail the people who are putting their trust in us to improve the health service and public services generally.</P>
    <P>The actions of the Government and the Minister for Finance, in particular, over the past three months will give many people cause for concern and cynicism. Having spent a year and a half drawing up, what is by any standards, an ambitious strategy, the Government then spent six to eight weeks tearing it up. The Minister for Finance made it crystal clear that he has no intention of financing the requirements of this strategy. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said in Ballymascanlon that he did not see that the need existed. When he introduced the Estimates for his Department in November, he said that he thought the health service was simply a black hole and he did not consider he was getting the necessary value for money by putting money into the service. He and his officials have made it clear on several occasions since the publication of this strategy that this is no more than a series of existing policies strung together and called a strategy. It is not; by any fair reading it is a strategy, for example, in terms of the capital needs which require the investment of a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>The Government has made it clear that it does not intend to deliver on the requirements of the strategy. Putting it in simple terms, it spent five years not doing a great deal about the health service, finally producing a strategy to which most of us could at least subscribe in part and another four or five weeks tearing it up and making it clear that it would rot on the shelf. I refer to the health service only as an example of the demands that will be placed on the Exchequer in terms of improvements in public services over the next ten years. An enormous challenge faces us and it must be managed on a five to ten year basis. We cannot allow the budget to increase incrementally by a little now, a little more next year and a little more the year after that. If that happens, the money will be sucked into the system and bogged down in the deep black hole to which the Minister for Finance referred.</P>
    <P>Although I have addressed the issue of the pension reserve fund on many occasions, I gave it more thought in recent months. I want to make it clear that when the reserve fund was announced two years ago, I supported it in principle. I had been talking about it for some time before the Minister made his decision. On the face of it, the idea was fair enough &ndash; if we had extra money, which we did, setting it aside for a future liability was as good an idea as any &ndash; but we have lost all sense of perspective and priority in the meantime.</P>
    <P>It is worth considering some of the figures the Department produced when the fund was set up. <Col N="641" /> The Minister commissioned Mercer consultants to carry out a study into future needs in terms of pensions. I will outline three figures as I do not want to read too many figures into the record. The cost of public service pensions and social welfare pensions is about 3.4% of GNP. That is the 1999 figure. The consultants did two projections, the first on the basis that pensions would increase in line with the CPI. They discovered that by the 2025, in a quarter of a century's time, the cost of pensions would be 2.8% of GNP, 0.6% lower than in 1999. They did a second projection based on the assumption that pensions would increase in line with average earnings and discovered that in that instance pensions would cost 5.7% of GNP, which, give or take, is 2% higher than in 1999. These figures show an increased dependency and an increase in costs, if relatively generous increases in pensions are assumed in the meantime, but this is no demographic time bomb.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a problem that could not be managed over a quarter of a century. If we did not contribute a single cent to this fund for the next 25 years, we would still almost certainly be able to manage it in the normal course of events in a quarter of a century's time. I want to make that absolutely clear. There is no demographic time bomb. This is a prudent measure when one has the money, but it requires us not only now, next year or the year after, but constantly to balance the needs of the future with the needs of the present. The health strategy alone will increase the percentage expenditure on health from roughly 8% now &ndash; it was 6.5% two years ago &ndash; to 12% or 13% over the course of the strategy. Those are the figures given by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about, give or take, a 5% increase in GNP in the cost of the health service over a ten year period versus a potential 2% increase in GNP, the cost of pensions over 25 years. Let us balance these figures. We must get some sense of our priorities. We could say it is prudent to put away money for a quarter of a century to meet a liability when one third of our population will be dead and suffer a mediocre health service in the meantime or we could examine the needs of the health service now and perhaps to spend some more of this money now. Perhaps we need to consider redefining the purpose of this fund. We need to examine the level of contribution we make because we are contributing &euro;1,050 million to the fund this year alone. That is enough to build Bertie's stadium in one go, but nobody seems to be debating this matter. Everybody seems to think this is an obvious choice and priority, but I say we should start the debate at this belated stage because it is not an obvious choice. We need to re-examine this measure to consider whether we are getting best value for money from it. If we can afford it and if that is the priority we want to set, by all means let us <Col N="642" /> continue to make the contributions, but I, for one, have moved from a position of being slightly sceptical about it to being, as Members will probably have gathered, a little more than slightly sceptical.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General had a few words to say about me over the weekend. He said that I and the Labour Party wanted to increase tax. He said that we wanted to coalesce or have a loose arrangement with independent Trotskyites, socialists of various colours and that a Marxist revolution was, if not inevitable, then certainly close to the turn of the corner. I understand that the Attorney General and president of the Progressive Democrats must scare the horses and suggest his party has some purpose in life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I comment on the Attorney General's comments is that I suspect his view is shared by others, not least his ideological buddy, the Minister for Finance. I am not in favour of high tax and I am certainly not in favour of high tax for the sake of it. Who would be? I said in the interview, which the Attorney General quoted reasonably accurately, that I am in favour of having something to show for the last seven or eight years of unprecedented economic growth. I favour using more of our national income to invest in public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the Minister's record. I can understand why he reduced income tax; my party has no plans to increase the rates of income tax. However, I would not have reduced the higher rate of income tax to the extent the Minister <Col N="643" /> reduced it. He has taken the guts out of capital acquisitions tax. Would we look at that again? We might. He has reduced the rate of capital gains tax. Would we look at that again? I am not saying we will but I will not say that we will not. He abolished betting tax and I understand his reason for doing so. He also abolished probate tax. It was a niggling tax which did not bring in much income but I still do not understand exactly why he did it. He reduced corporation tax from approximately 32% when he took office to the current rate of 16%. That is in accordance with an agreement which my party had entered into in the process of negotiating with the European Union and we have no intention of reversing it, at least for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>In the last budget, however, the Minister spent &euro;270 million reducing employers' PRSI. I would not have done that and if circumstances required greater funds in the social insurance fund, we might well reverse it. We have no plans in that regard. I am not here today to say we will increase certain taxes but, as I said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on the day after the budget, I disagree with the way the Minister has either abolished or reduced certain taxes &ndash; I was explicit in not including income tax in that &ndash; and we might have to look at them again. I have no hesitation in repeating that. I am determined that the investment needed to ensure we have quality health services will be made by my party if it is in Government for the next four years. If we do not do that and deliver better public services, we should not be in Government and I would not wish to be party to it.</P>
    <P>If we do not increase taxes, how do we ensure the level of investment? About two years ago my party, under my direction in this case, produced a policy document called New Directions, New Priorities. In that document we looked at where we then stood in terms of economic growth and projected the situation forward using conservative figures. By and large the figures were approved of by or replicated those of the Department of Finance. It was clear at that time that it was possible to sustain increased investment in services from the existing current budget surplus or from surpluses that were likely to arise in the future.</P>
    <P>Since then, matters have disimproved but we still have a current budget surplus of &euro;5.5 billion. We are far from a position where we might run a current budget deficit. I am absolutely determined that we will never return to the course on which we embarked in the 1970s, that is, borrowing for current budget purposes. However, if we have to borrow for capital purposes, we should do it. I said that six months ago and I have repeated it on a number of occasions since. There is a world of difference between borrowing for infrastructural investment, which will hopefully be productive and provide a return to the economy, and borrowing to keep going from day to day. While one would prefer to be able to finance <Col N="644" /> everything from the Exchequer without the need to borrow, if we need to borrow for infrastructural and productive investment, let us do it. If we do not do it, the cost to the country in social and economic terms will be far greater than the cost of doing it.</P>
    <P>My party can do what it wishes to do, purely in terms of infrastructural investment and investment in services, despite the disimproved circumstances in which we find ourselves. However, if is necessary to look again at CAT, CGT and employers' PRSI, I will do that. That is my personal view. My party will set out its view in a few weeks. The Attorney General can sleep comfortably at night, therefore, because my party has no plan to increase the income tax rates.</P>
    <P>I was struck by an interview given by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, on the radio last Friday before the Progressive Democrats conference. He was being questioned on similar lines and was seeking to give similar responses to the Attorney General. He said the Progress Democrats favoured increasing indirect taxes and not increasing direct taxes. I was fascinated. It was the first time I had heard it. If it is the case, I would love to hear him say it again and explain his reasons.</P>
    <P>It is, in fact, consistent with what this Government has done. A few weeks ago the Government increased the excise duty on petrol by the equivalent of 30 pence a gallon. By any standard, that is an enormous increase; it amounts to an increase of 20% in the rate of excise. In addition, having reduced VAT by 1% last year, the Government increased it again this year by 1%. This Government is no stranger to increasing taxes. While I understand why some members of the Government like to focus on particular types of tax, they should not do so with the holier than thou attitude they like to affect.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the individual provisions in the Bill. I will start with section 12, which is the newest provision in the sense that we have not had an opportunity to comment on it previously. It provides for the tax break for sportsmen. I am bewildered by the provision. I have no idea where it came from, who lobbied for it and who it is intended to benefit or who it will benefit. It defies logic. In the first instance, it is not really a tax break. My understanding of a tax break is that one pays less tax or one can write off certain things against tax while one is earning. That is not what is contained in this provision. It appears to be a lump sum benefit when one retires.</P>
    <P>I assume the Minister is seeking to encourage people to make a decision to play sport in Ireland on the basis that they might get a lump sum, depending on their earnings in the meantime, in ten years. I am not sure it can work like that. I am not sure that a person who is trying to decide whether he or she wants to make a career in sport would have the luxury of deciding to do sot here rather than in England or elsewhere simply because, presuming there is no change in the law <Col N="645" /> in the meantime, they will get a lump sum in ten years. That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister is focusing on its application retrospectively. Maybe he is looking back to 1990 and has particular people or groups of people in mind who he believes have made a great deal of money in the past ten years and are about to retire. If they are, it will work only if they have been living here. They cannot come back here and gain the benefit. They will not get the benefit because they have not been resident here and do not qualify. Even retrospectively, therefore, I cannot see how the provision has an incentive effect or how it encourages people, who would not otherwise have done or who are not already doing so, to play sport here.</P>
    <P>I can only imagine this is a means of giving a few euro to guys whose careers are almost over in a way that will not affect what they do now. The Minister of State, I believe, does not have a clear vision of how his colleague is thinking on this matter. Only the Minister for Finance knows the logic behind this proposal and he needs to explain it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Only he knows who lobbied as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is also true. The Minister, however, is capable of thinking of some fairly daft ideas without any lobbying. There are Ministers whom one suspects might meet people in pubs and come away thinking, &ldquo;That is a brilliant idea; I must go out and do it&rdquo;. In my experience, however, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is capable of doing something by himself.</P>
      <P>I met a colleague who works in the Labour Party offices as I was coming to the Chamber this morning and he asked me to use this line, &ldquo;We have had tax breaks for the rich from the Minister, now we have tax breaks for the rich and famous&rdquo;. I said I would use the line and I have. Another colleague urged me to use another analogy, although I probably should not. He said, &ldquo;Let us assume the Minister is trying to give some recognition to people who work for a short period of time and give lots of pleasure. If we applied that logic, we could apply it to prostitutes because they sometimes give lots of pleasures and work for a short period of time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to make a joke of the provision. There are many people who work for a relatively short period of time, sometimes by choice and sometimes because it is the nature of their careers, who get no recognition. It is beyond me why the Minister should specifically pick sportsmen as an example. He is well aware by now that amateur sportsmen, particularly in the GAA, are mightily upset, and rightly so, by what they see as a gesture to others which does not benefit them. Taking the Minister's figure of &euro;5 million as an indicator, we could have given &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 as a straight grant to every championship player who went into Croke Park last year. That might have been a better use of the money than some<Col N="646" /> thing which will undoubtedly concentrate the benefits in the hands of a small amount of people, most of whom are well off already. I do not know where Deputy McCreevy got this idea. It is not particularly offensive or expensive, but I suspect he will upset more people than he makes happy.</P>
    <P>Littered throughout this Bill, and the Minister's previous Finance Bills, are various types of tax break, particularly capital allowances. I do not object to using these to make up for a market failure. If we identify something that we want to see happening then we might give the market some help. Student accommodation, for example, was not being built because it was not sufficiently profitable and so we provided capital allowances. These did not do the job, so the Minister has decided to extend them. There are other examples such as park and ride facilities in Dublin for which capital allowances were not taken up, which is not to say that we do not need park and ride facilities, as I know because I use the DART. However, the Minister has an ideological block whereby if he sees that something is not happening, he introduces tax breaks. That is good if it does the job, but if not, then we should recognise that we need park and ride facilities and provide them. We should spend public money in doing these things rather than develop the increasingly convoluted tax breaks and capital allowances which have to be extended and for which we must send experienced officials from the Department of Finance to Brussels to negotiate clearance.</P>
    <P>Child care is the best example of where tax breaks have not worked. There are numerous breaks, which most of us cannot follow, to ensure this vital facility is provided, but it has not been. We should not scrap the allowances, but let us acknowledge that we may have to provide child care directly, either through the State or local authorities. I will not oppose the extension of town renewal, urban renewal, student accommodation and other tax breaks, but we must recognise that some do not work and we must intervene, although the time for that has passed in some cases.</P>
    <P>I support the extension of the BES and the seed capital scheme, although I do not understand why the significant change is introduced. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment carried out a review of the BES and SCS, and was happy with the cap of &euro;317,000. However, the Bill increases it to &euro;750,000. I support in principal finance through these schemes for SMEs starting up since such seed capital is needed, but there is also scope for abuse and a level of tax planning that I find unacceptable. I thought the Minister accepted that argument, but he has gone back on it and increased the limits in a manner that makes no sense. I hope that he will explain this.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister was in Brussels at an ECOFIN meeting where, after a lengthy debate, it was agreed not to accede to the Commission's request to give a formal warning to Germany and <Col N="647" /> Portugal over their budget deficits. This should be discussed in more than the business pages as it could become a problem for other countries and could fundamentally affect the stability of the euro. The terms of the stability and growth pact are too strict and do not make much sense where it does not distinguish between capital investment and current spending. We could be in a position soon, along with other countries, where we have a current budget surplus but are borrowing beyond the limit allowed in the pact. That would be inequitable and should be avoided long before it arises.</P>
    <P>Looking at Germany over the past year, should we not allow normal economic stabilisers to come into play when a large economy is close to recession? We all know that stringent financial constraints mean there is a greater danger of deflation and recession. We should allow Germany to spend its way out of recession instead of imposing restraints for the currency's sake. This is no academic argument for us as Germany is about 40% of the eurozone economy and any recession there will affect our economy. We must start the debate &ndash; I accept it is easier to start it in Opposition than in Government &ndash; because we must distinguish between capital and current spending and find a better mechanism for allowing countries such as Germany to run a certain deficit rather than the current rigid 3% figure which applies irrespective of circumstances. Fines are provided for in the pact which no one envisages being imposed and the danger is that the bluff, of the Commission and the pact, will be called leaving us worse off.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss other matters in more detail on Committee Stage, but the one glaring absence from the Bill and the Minister's speech was a reference to the climate change strategy. Towards the end of 2000, he announced that carbon related taxes would be introduced from 2002. That gave people time to prepare, by using less energy or more environmentally friendly energy sources. Most people who care about these issues thought that was appropriate rather than introducing major taxes overnight.</P>
    <P>It has not happened, however. I know from the tax strategy group papers, which were supplied by the Department and are available on the Internet, that this was discussed by the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Finance. A green tax group provided a stimulating report, under the impression that the strategy's recommendations would be acted upon. The Minister has made only negative mention of carbon taxes and has given no indication of any commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. This is not academic either as we have legally committed ourselves, as will the EU as a whole, to reducing carbon emissions to 13% from 1990. As matters stand, the figure will be 30% plus, which will involve us in serious difficulties if we do not get to grips with it soon. We are entitled to ask the Minister what <Col N="648" /> happened to the national climate change strategy. What happened to the commitment to introduce carbon based taxes or the commitment to try to meet the Kyoto Protocol by some kind of tax measure, something about which many care deeply?</P>
    <P>During the budget debate I spoke about the need to maintain spending on roads. I also mentioned it earlier. We have had a very unedifying row since then between the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority. Unfortunately, the bottom line is crystal clear: there is no money in the kitty this year to progress any new projects. This is deplorable and unnecessary. It is being done purely in order that the Minister can say he is avoiding borrowing. This is short-sighted and should not happen. I hope it is reversed soon.</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding tonnage in the shipping industry are interesting. This has been inevitable since other EU countries introduced corporation tax on a tonnage basis. In a sense it is instructive, as it is a unique occasion for us in Ireland to find other countries effectively undercutting us in terms of corporation tax and to find ourselves obliged to move to what is effectively a lower rate. Perhaps it is no harm for the shoe to be on the other foot, as it were, and for us to realise how some of our partners feel about us when, as they see it, we undercut them in terms of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister's fifth annual Finance Bill and his seventh in all. During the last five years he has done many of the things he wanted to do. I agreed with some, though not very many, and disagreed with others. I will say one thing: he has been consistent and coherent. I am sorry he is not here to hear this, but we always knew where he was coming from, even though we did not particularly share his values. While the country would be a mighty better place were he not there, I acknowledge that within his terms he has achieved a considerable amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough. I always listen with great interest to the Deputy, but before he leaves, when he refers to the tax changes, which have been substantial and to which I will return, the one area he picked on in the social service area was the health sector, though we could also look at education. If he looks at the Government's record during the past five years, he will see a 126% increase in health spending. One cannot conceive of where he is coming from in suggesting the focus of the Minister or Government was exclusively on the area of tax reduction. There has been massive attention given to and investment in health and education. At a time when <Col N="649" /> the numbers of unemployed fell dramatically, the spread and increase in spending in other areas, such as pensions and children's allowance in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, have been incredible. It has not been the case that the Labour Party has not been in office or uninvolved in government for a long time; it has been. If one compares the record the Minister, the Government and I stand over and that of the Labour Party, they do not bear comparison. It is wrong to suggest the Government was not equally committed to development of and massive investment in social services.</P>
      <P>That is not to say, however, that everything we need to achieve has been achieved. It has not, far from it. There is much more we have to do in this area. Other sectors will continue to need investment, such as those highlighted by the Deputy. I do not disagree with him in that regard. However, it is reasonable to acknowledge that whatever one's views of the way personal tax, corporation tax or any other tax is structured, there have been substantial benefits to enterprise and the economy in personal and company taxation, but an equal measure of attention was given to social services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to disagree, but I always listen to Deputy McDowell's contributions and felt compelled to point out what is reasonable and fair.</P>
      <P>l am proud we have provided the State with good and effective government and our time in office has seen the creation of an economic climate which has helped all areas of our economy to flourish. It is clear there cannot be progress in other areas without the benefit of a strong economy.</P>
      <P>We have achieved one of the best economic performances in the world in the last four years and the following figures demonstrate this point: taking the years 1998-2001 as a whole, the economy has grown, in GDP terms, by an annual average of 9.5%, while our debt-GDP ratio stood at 74% in 1996 before we came into office. At end 2001 it stood at around 36%, the second lowest in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Government has been very effective in its stewardship of the economy. One achievement which must stand out is that more than 300,000 new jobs have been created since 1997. As a result, unemployment has fallen from 10.3% in 1997 to an estimated average of 4% last year. Long-term unemployment has also fallen significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" />The Government has made significant progress in many areas: taxation, social expenditure, education, health and the development of our national infrastructure. Some of the provisions of the Bill help build on our existing record of success. On the income tax front, during the last five years we have made major changes to the benefit of income earners and the economy generally: changes which continue to be provided for in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>We have increased the incentive to work, and the reward for work, by reducing the overall burden of personal taxation. For example, in 1997, before the Government took office, the average tax rate, that is, tax and levies combined as a percentage of gross income, for a single person on the average industrial wage was 27%. Today, the equivalent figure is 17%. That is a real and tangible improvement. The most recent data available from the OECD indicate that for a single person on the average production wage Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Tax rates have been reduced substantially, basic personal credits increased and the standard rate band widened significantly. It all means less tax to be paid and a greater incentive to work. Five years ago a person hit the top rate of tax at an income level well under the average industrial wage. Today, when the changes in this Finance Bill are taken into account, a person would have to be earning appreciably more than the average industrial wage before facing tax at the higher rate. Furthermore, the entry point to taxation was &euro;98 per week for the single person when the Government took office. It is now &euro;209 per week or 90% of the current minimum wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not absolutely correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been characterised by some as only favouring the wealthy, but the facts, painful as they may be for the Opposition, tell a different story. Of the &euro;4.8 billion in income tax reductions, just 11% went to cut the top rate of income tax while 43% went on increasing basic tax allowances, or credits as they now are, including PAYE credits. This has distributed the fruits of economic success to all taxpayers, not just one group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only has the Government reduced the personal tax burden, it has ensured a favourable business environment through its corporation tax policy. The standard rate of corporation tax on trading profits has fallen to 16% from 1 January 2002 and will fall to 12.5 % from l January 2003. This promotes the development of a strong business sector in Ireland &ndash; a keystone of our economic success. The Bill contains a range of measures designed to help Irish business whether through supporting small business through the BES and the seed capital scheme, facilitating Irish financial services competing internationally through streamlining various provisions or helping the Irish shipping industry to compete on a <Col N="651" /> level playing field through a new tonnage tax regime. Those are just some of the provisions.</P>
    <P>Two important tax based schemes which are useful to entrepreneurs are the business expansion scheme and the seed capital scheme. The business expansion scheme, which has been in existence since 1984, provides tax relief for individuals investing in unquoted companies engaged in certain qualifying trades. The seed capital scheme, which began in 1993, allows an individual who leaves employment and invests in a new business, with little or no job displacement, to claim a refund of tax paid in previous years.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill proposes that the business expansion scheme and the seed capital scheme be renewed for a further period of two years and that the existing company limits for each scheme be increased to &euro;750,000 from their current level of &euro;317,500. In the case of the seed capital scheme, investors will, subject to the annual investment limit of &euro;31,750, be allowed to spread their investment over six years rather than the current five years. This means the amount on which they can get a refund of tax will increase from &euro;158,750 to &euro;190,500. These schemes have been an important source of finance for start-up companies and for the SME sector in Ireland. I understand there has been an increased level of interest and uptake in the schemes since these changes were announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of business incentives, employee financial participation is important in encouraging greater partnership at the level of the firm. The alignment of the views of employees and management should help make companies more competitive and successful. The Government continues to be supportive by giving tax concessions to such schemes, for example, the approved profit sharing schemes, employee share ownership trusts and save as you earn and share option schemes.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of requests to change the tax treatment of gainsharing schemes. Gainsharing is a simple concept which involves sharing in the benefits from any productivity gains or savings between the management of a company and the employees. However, under gainsharing schemes, employees generally receive a monetary payment rather than shares. I support the idea of gainsharing and I am aware of the benefits it has bestowed on Bausch and Lomb in Waterford in terms of increased employment and activity generally in the company. It has also increased partnership between the management and the employees of the company. It is a microcosm of national social partnership working in a private sector company and it has much to commend it. I hope we will reach a point where we will be able to consider the scheme in real tax terms.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficulties in designing a scheme of tax relief in a way that does not lead to a generalised scheme of tax relieved remuneration and, accordingly, it is not considered feas<Col N="652" /> ible at present to extend tax relief to these schemes. I acknowledge that the submissions made and the example of the scheme used in the company mentioned are helpful contributions towards framing a successful and suitable tax scheme in the gainsharing area.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Irish shipping industry will benefit significantly from a tax measure introduced in this year's Finance Bill &ndash; the tonnage tax. A tonnage tax regime is an alternative method for shipping companies to calculate their profits for corporation tax purposes. The tonnage tax profits are calculated by reference to the tonnage or weight of ships operated by a company. The tonnage tax is optional. Companies may remain subject to the normal corporation tax rules for calculation of profits. The introduction of this provision will help the Government protect the long-term future of the Irish shipping industry and help secure jobs both ashore and at sea. Arklow Shipping has already added a new ship to the Irish fleet on foot of this Government initiative.</P>
    <P>The tax measure is particularly important for those coastal communities which provide the majority of our seafarers. Our shipping industry and its skilled workforce have played a major part in the country's success as a trading nation. I hope the sector will enjoy significant growth in the coming years, backed by both domestic and EU initiatives. The tonnage tax follows earlier Government initiatives for the sector, such as the unique seafarers' income tax allowance. Coming from the maritime constituency of Waterford where there is major shipping and fishing in Dunmore East, I welcome this imaginative initiative. The measure is subject to clearance by the European Commission from a state aid perspective and when this is achieved the necessary commencement order will be made.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government commitment to the targeted use of tax reliefs to assist in the regeneration and rejuvenation of the core areas of our urban areas, the Bill provides for a two year extension to the 31 December 2002 deadline of both the urban renewal scheme and the relief for multi-storey car parks. The urban renewal scheme is aimed primarily at towns with populations in excess of 6,000 and a total of 49 areas in the State have been designated for a range of targeted reliefs under this scheme since 1999. In my own county both Dungarvan and Waterford city have had areas designated for relief under the scheme. While I am aware that the initial take-up of the scheme has been less that originally anticipated, I have been informed that a significant number of projects are currently in the planning process. I am confident this extension will enable the majority of these projects to avail of the generous reliefs available under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a further measure which extends the number of sites that can avail of the rented residential or section 23 type relief under both the urban renewal scheme and the town renewal scheme. When sites and sub-areas <Col N="653" /> were originally selected for designation for relief under both schemes, only a limited number of sites were selected for rented residential relief. Overall, rented residential relief will now be available in respect of a total of 1,785 sites in the areas designated under both schemes. This measure will provide for an additional boost in the housing supply, particularly in the provision of rental accommodation, as well as further stimulating the programme of regeneration in towns and cities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There will also be a two year extension to the 31 December 2002 deadline of the rural renewal scheme. This is a pilot scheme whereby the types of reliefs normally available for the regeneration of inner city areas have been applied to the upper Shannon area. The aims of the scheme are simple &ndash; to encourage more people to stay in the area and to move into the area, as well as stimulating economic activity generally. The scheme has been in operation since 1998 and has proved to be successful in stimulating an increase in investment primarily in owner occupier residential property. Some of the areas designated under the scheme have seen increases in the order of 200% in the number of planning applications in the recent past. This two year extension will allow us to build on the success of the scheme to date and help to arrest once and for all population decline in the upper Shannon area.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the restoration of interest relief as a deductible expense in calculating tax on rental income from residential property. The interest in question is interest on borrowed moneys employed in the purchase, improvement or repair of such property by an individual, partnership or company and which accrues on or after 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>As regards the change in interest relief and the changes in the treatment of stamp duty introduced in the budget for investors in housing, we recognised that circumstances in the property market were much changed. There was a significant downturn in the house building industry due to weakening in demand in the property market against a background of a slowdown in economic activity generally. This would have serious consequences for activity and employment in the house building sector, for housing supply for purchasers and for the supply of property for rent if it continued. These considerations were instrumental in the decision to adjust the rates of stamp duty for investors to align them with those for owner occupiers, other than first-time buyers purchasing second hand houses. The effect of the changes is that an investor purchasing a new house or a second hand house will pay the same rate of stamp duty as an owner occupier, other than a first time buyer who purchases a second hand property. This change will hopefully help to maintain and increase housing supply while safeguarding employment in a vital sector of the economy. The expected increase in supply of rented property should also assist in stabilising the levels of rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" />The Government believes in using tax reliefs and incentives to promote and help desirable social change in health and to develop sports and sporting activities. In the context of changes to health, I want to mention one measure which is provided for in the Bill, namely, the proposed extension of the relief for reimbursed medical expenses. As the House will be aware, the relief is being widened so that claims may be made for reimbursed expenses incurred for a wider range of relatives and for relatives or non-relatives aged 65 or over or for those who are permanently incapacitated. I am not in any doubt that this measure will be of help, particularly to the elderly in the context of their long-term care needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides a new relief from income tax in respect of the direct sports earnings of certain sportspersons, such as athletes, badminton, squash and tennis players, boxers, cyclists, footballers, golfers, jockeys, motor racing drivers, rugby players and swimmers. The earnings to which the relief applies are earnings deriving from actual participation in the sport concerned, such as prize money, performance fees and so on. Other earnings, such as sponsorship fees, endorsements and so on are not included. The relief takes the form of a deduction from earnings equal to 40% of those earnings for up to any ten years of assessment back to and including the tax year 1990-91 for which years the sportsperson was tax resident in the State. The relief will be given by way of repayment of tax and is to be claimed in the year in which the sportsperson ceases permanently to be engaged in that sport provided he or she is tax resident in the State in that year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister for Finance has decided to introduce the scheme. Sportspersons play an important part in our society. They motivate and encourage people of all ages to attend or to participate in sporting activities. We are all aware of the need to encourage people of all ages to lead more active lives and if this measure can help to achieve this, it would be a positive result for all our people.</P>
    <P>Another measure designed to support the valuable role sport plays in the lives of many people is the extension to sports bodies of tax relief on donations. This measure was proposed last year and I am pleased to note that the Minister for Finance has been able to follow through on last year's commitment to examine the proposal.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a new scheme to allow tax relief on donations for capital sports projects is welcome news for sports bodies all around the country which may be planning refurbishment of their facilities or, indeed, construction of new facilities. The Government wants to support sports bodies which provide the means for people to enjoy healthy and fulfilling leisure activities and contribute to the cultural life of the nation. That is why, subject to the approval of the Mini<Col N="655" /> ster for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, projects costing up to &euro;40 million will be eligible for inclusion in this scheme.</P>
    <P>As I emphasised earlier, the key to Irish development across all fronts is economic growth. Our taxation policy which has encouraged work and promoted employment has been central to our record economic achievement in our time in office. It is with great pride that I commend this Finance Bill to the House.</P>

I participated in Committee Stage debates on this Bill in previous years and look forward to doing so in future.</P>
      <P>As a result of measures taken by this Government in recent times, we now have a minimum wage which was set at a very high level compared to some European countries. Some 90% of the current minimum wage, when employee tax credit is taken into account, will be free from tax at £165 per week.

      <P>For single income couples in receipt of carer's credit, the exemption will be &euro;443 per week, which is a tremendous boost. The minimum wage should be totally exempt from income tax. If we had taken the view proposed by other parties a lower minimum wage would have been introduced, in the first place, which would have been outside the tax net. When we brought in such a generous minimum wage we encountered the problem which we are now resolving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" />The Minister for Finance has been consistent in recent years in allowing tax credit for mortgage holders. This is a remarkable situation which I regard as one of the most important things we have done for people on low wages. People on low wages, for example, a combination of a part-time job and social welfare, and paying a mortgage to a financial institution or their local authority saw others receiving this benefit for many years. Through the introduction of the tax credit system, they are now getting a reduction on their mortgage. From 1 January this year, their mortgage payments will have reduced. I do not think this point has been made sufficiently strongly. I hope everyone is checking the reduction their mortgage payments in January. If the reductions did not occur, they should immediately contact the tax office to ensure they get their full tax credit.</P>
    <P>Last Friday I attended a meeting in Abbeyleix arranged by the Laois Chamber of Commerce. Representatives were in attendance from the county enterprise board, the Leader programme and other State bodies. I was very pleased to hear the tremendous praise from local businesses in regard to the major increase up to a level of &euro;650,000 in the limit for the business expansion schemes. They said this will give practical benefit to small businesses throughout the country. I will go by what they say, although some may not consider their opinion as important as that of the Department of Finance. The previous limit of &euro;317,000, approximately £250,000, was not sufficient. Setting up a business, acquiring premises, going through the planning process and all that is involved in a new enterprise was not possible under the previous limits. Business people are delighted that the scheme will attract considerable additional investment into their businesses. There has been criticism of that increase in this House in the last hour and I want to emphasise that there is another side to the story.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell used a funny phrase about Germany being allowed to spend its way out of a recession. That epitomises, more than anything else, the fundamental difference between this Government and what is being proposed by the Opposition which wants to spend its way out of the recession while our approach is to work our way out of it by providing incentives to businesses to create jobs and by providing incentives to people to go out and work by reducing their income tax rates. There is a fundamental difference between these approaches to getting out of a difficult economic situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the deadline of the town renewal schemes to 31 December 2004. This is very welcome and I would like a progress report on this scheme, possibly on Committee Stage. I tabled parliamentary questions on this matter to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, as the level of take-up is very disappointing. I recognise the necessity for these schemes to be cleared by Europe, but we intro<Col N="657" /> duced a new level of paperwork into the scheme which I believe will result in its strangulation by red tape. This scheme has the potential to be the most beneficial of its kind ever introduced. The refurbishment of old buildings is in question and, for a person to obtain approval, an outline plan and accurate estimate is required before work commences. This is creating serious difficulties for people who would otherwise be interested in the scheme. How many sites have been designated in recent years and how many have been completed? Judging by the Minister's answer to my parliamentary question, the figure is very disappointing.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally, I have tabled a motion in my own local authority regarding the efforts being taken at local authority level to promote this scheme. When local authorities were drawing up the area plans, many of them hired consultants for a period of months who went out to look at every property in the town which was making submissions. They photographed the properties and spoke to the owners regarding their submissions. Temporary staff were at times employed to assist with this work but there was no progression beyond submissions. In each of the four provincial towns in County Laois between 20 and 50 sites are designated. There has been no promotion and the owners of the properties and the auctioneers are not being brought in to tell people about the benefits of the scheme. I would like to see the scheme promoted because people have not fully understood what it is about. They thought it was a grants scheme and they do not understand some of the intricacies of its tax incentive aspect. It is important that there is departmental co-ordination on this. The scheme does not just involve planning and building, it involves tax incentives and financial management. The required expertise in tax advice does not exist in any local authority and that is a gap in the system which needs to be filled.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 29 of the Bill, which expands the definition of the &ldquo;qualifying quota&rdquo; which will qualify for relief under the scheme of capital announced for the purchase of milk quotas. This relief will be available in respect of any other milk quota purchased by active producers on or after 1 April 2000. I look forward to that being of benefit.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service and I look forward to robust discussion of this Bill on Committee Stage and to the urgent enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share ten minutes of my time with Deputy Deenihan. Perhaps the Chair will remind me of that.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill, 2002. Before the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, leaves, there are a couple of points I have to make relating to part of what he said earlier. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" />The Government believes in using tax reliefs and incentives to promote and help desirable social change in health and to develop sports and sporting activities. In the context of changes to health, I want to mention one measure which is provided for in the Bill, namely, the proposed extension of the relief for reimbursed medical expenses.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State went on to talk about what that extension will do. That reads beautifully if you approach it as somebody who comes in from outside. The Government proposes to classify desirable medical relief as something for which a tax incentive will be designated, but it gets away from the law of this land. The law, as defined in the 1970 Act and clarified by the Ombudsman, says that medical expenses incurred by elderly people should be paid for by the State. The Ombudsman has said that on a number of occasions, and that nursing home care should be paid for by the State. We have had no response from the State on that. The Government has said in the Finance Bill, 2002, that these medical expenses are tax allowable. That is to go only part of the way towards what is the law of the land. Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, will have a look at the Ombudsman's report on nursing homes and see what was said. It was stated very clearly and reiterated before a committee of this House. The Ombudsman is bringing forward another report setting out again his clear view that nursing home care should be paid for by the State. What is being provided in this Bill does not satisfy the many people who incur huge bills for maintaining elderly people in nursing homes. It is unsatisfactory that they should be treated in this way.</P>
    <P>One looks at what this Government has delivered in recent years and at what the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has done. The Minister has promoted himself as the great innovator who has changed the whole taxation base and put more money back into people's pockets. The reality is somewhat different. What the Minister has been engaged in has been, to a great extent, sleight of hand. He has reduced the rates and broadened bands, but the net effect on people's incomes, particularly at the lower end of the scale, has not been great. I refer the House to a report entitled &ldquo;Changing Incomes, Unchanged Taxation&rdquo; by Eunan King of NCB Stockbrokers. One of the points he makes which is worth noting is that since income tax rates have been reduced, tax bands widened and allowances increased, there is a public perception that the Government's income tax policies in the 1990s have been stimulatory. However, the changes to allowances, tax bands and tax rates of recent years have done no more than offset the rise in the average tax rate which the progressive structure of the tax system would have brought about as income rose. Bands had to be kept moving to keep abreast of what was happening and reduce rates to keep people out of the top rate of tax. Mr. King con<Col N="659" /> cluded that the overall income tax burden did not fall to any extent during the 1990s. The average proportion of income paid in tax remained at around 21% throughout the decade. Budgetary tax changes did no more than off-set the tendency for the average tax rate to rise in a progressive tax system. Mr. King does not have an axe to grind with anybody and it is a very interesting report. I am sure there will be some response from the Minister to it. It points to what has happened.</P>
    <P>Despite the change in rates, a lot of money does not seem to have been put back into people's pockets, particularly the pockets of the average income earner. Of course, many at the top end have done very well and have gained significantly. Simple mathematics shows that the tax incentives given to single people earning more than &euro;60,000 in recent years amount to almost &euro;1 billion. These are well-off single people who are earning significant sums of money and the Government has concentrated many of the tax reliefs on them. Compare that to what has happened to those at the lower end of the scale who earn the minimum wage. The Minister for Finance told us that he could not afford to take those on the minimum wage out of the tax net, yet he could do what I mentioned for the well off. In the same period he was able to provide hundreds of millions of pounds to reduce betting tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is simplifying what has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the new budget he has added a special incentive for sports people, a subject I will come back to in a few minutes. Despite that, he was not able to find any money to take those on the minimum wage out of the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his five years as Minister, this great pioneer has failed to look at some of the anomalies and difficulties within the taxation system. The Revenue Commissioners agree the level of income of an individual taxpayer and issue a certificate to him or her. If that taxpayer then goes to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs with that certificate, it will not be accepted as a legitimate statement of their income. If it was a taxpayer who is a self-employed person with a low income would be entitled to request family income supplement. If you are self-employed, you are not allowed family income supplement simply because the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs does not trust the figures certified by the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister for Finance has done nothing about that. It leads to injustice. In the case of two householders living side by side with the same commitments and family size, one being in the PAYE sector and the other operating a small post office, shop or farm, the former is entitled to a top-up from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the latter, with an income certified by the Revenue <Col N="660" /> Commissioners as being the same as that of his or her neighbour, is not. It is not fair that the Minister should preside over that in his period in office.</P>
    <P>If, for example, a taxi owner, whose income of &euro;19,000 is certified by the Revenue Commissioners, applies to the Department of Education and Science or through its agent, the local authority, for a higher education grant for his two children, the Department will say it wants to see his or her accounts. If the person has in those accounts, a legitimate expense such as a lease agreement for a car which is necessary for work, that is added to the person's income. The person's income, in those circumstances, can exceed the limit and the child will not qualify for the grant. That is not fair.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has a particular soft spot for the taxi men as we all know from a recording by local radio. Would he be content to see a taxi owner, who has a clean bill of health in terms of a tax certificate from the Revenue Commissioners, refused a higher education grant for his child for that reason? That is unfair. Why should it happen? Why should one discriminate against anybody who has a lease agreement for a car which he or she uses for business purposes? This should be looked at. In other words, the Department of Education and Science is saying to the Revenue Commissioners, &ldquo;We do not trust the work you have done. We do not trust the figures you have approved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Individualisation is another injustice on the taxation front. Let us look at two households anywhere in the country whose gross income is &euro;56,000. In the first household there is one earner on &euro;56,000 and in the second there are two earners with a combined income of &euro;56,000. They have similar mortgages and similar houses. How are they treated? The State says to the earner in the single income family, &ldquo;You must pay an additional &euro;80 a week because your spouse does not work.&rdquo;  Is it fair, where the spouse, for her own reasons, has decided not to work outside the home, that we should treat her in that way? This is another injustice which is presided over by this Minister. It is an injustice brought in by this Minister and he continues doggedly to see it through. That provision is grossly unfair and should not be in the system.</P>
    <P>We hear the Government talk about the marvellous job it has done. It has provided money, here, there and everywhere. I will acknowledge that it has spent more in some areas. In the health services it has spent a good deal of money. It has increased expenditure and we all agree that nurses, junior doctors, etc., should have got more, but what has happened within the health services and why are the people not happy with them? I suggest that the Government has failed to manage the health services properly.</P>
    <P>Management in many areas within the health services leaves much to be desired. I have seen this in a hospital in my area, where we increased the number of consultants, surgeons and theatres. <Col N="661" /> When we questioned the lack of increase in outputs, the response was, &ldquo;We do not have beds for patients when we operate on them and therefore the outputs have not increased.&rdquo; Who then made the decisions for increases in expenditure in all these areas which would not result in increased outputs? It is absolutely ridiculous and that is where this Government has failed so miserably in carrying through on those.</P>
    <P>In education there is a lack of psychological services around the country, but the issue in this area I particularly want to talk about is the schools buildings programme. It is disgraceful. There are in the region of 800 schools waiting for approval for major capital projects.</P>
    <P>In my area there are a number of schools in the process of looking for major capital funding. There is a vocational school to be built in Castlepollard in County Westmeath. Lo and behold, we saw in the local newspaper a few months ago that the Taoiseach was coming to cut the sod. That was great news, the Taoiseach would cut the sod and get on with the building of the school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>However, a problem arose. It was a very windy day and the sod-cutting, we were told, had to be abandoned because they could not go out on the field on a windy wet day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why that was put forward as an excuse because the real reason the sod was not cut was the Department of Education and Science said, &ldquo;We have not approved this school yet. It is still at stages 4 and 5, and we have not given approval for stage 6, which is the tender process&rdquo;, and one cannot cut a sod until the tender process is completed.</P>
      <P>At CBS Mullingar, for example, stages 4 and 5 are with the Department since last May and there has been no progress. There is a Gaelscoil in Mullingar at the same stage, waiting to be approved. Planning permission and everything else is in order but there has been no progress.</P>
      <P>There is to be a new school for Coralstown in County Westmeath. A Senator, not Senator Cassidy but Senator Glynn, stood up at a public meeting in March 1998 and said, &ldquo;This school is approved. It is written in stone. You will be in your new school in September of next year.&rdquo;, that is, September 1999. Not only has a sod not been turned but we have not even got to the stage of thinking about turning the sod, but I am sure in the run up to the election there will be flurry of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not give them ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to look at the capital projects <Col N="662" /> within his Department. If we can enter into PPPs to provide the infrastructure for roads, surely we should also be able to do so for schools. There is one project in place for five schools in County Cork. Why not extend it to try and clear this log-jam? This is a major problem and we must do something about it.</P>
      <P>There was some talk earlier about the pension fund. Why not invest the pension fund in those schools and those infrastructure projects? We are putting aside this huge amount of money and it will be needed at some stage, but why not use it now for worthwhile infrastructural projects like schools?</P>
      <P>I will briefly address the issue of tax relief for sports persons. I do not know from where this idea came, who looked for it or who will benefit from it, but it certainly seems to be one of those ideas conceived out of the blue. Why does this relief apply only to some sports people? Incidentally, it is a retrospective relief. If they have been living here for the past ten years and are about to retire from their chosen careers, they can avail of this relief. If they decide to play golf, tennis, squash, badminton or become boxers and remain resident in Ireland, they will be able to claw back some of the tax they paid in Ireland.</P>
      <P>What about the people who play sport day in, day out up and down the country? What about our great national games, where sports people such as Deputy Deenihan, who entertained us for years, go out on a weekly basis and entertain the public without receiving any remuneration? What benefit will they derive from this relief?</P>
      <P>The Minister rather glibly stated that it does not matter, it is only a small amount of money. He said in his speech:</P>
      <P>The relief can be claimed in the year in which the sports person ceases to be permanently engaged in that sport, provided the individual is resident for tax in that year, and will begin by way of repayment of tax. The cost of this measure is not estimated to be very significant &ndash; it is unlikely to exceed &euro;5 million a year on average on an ongoing basis. It does not matter, it is only &euro;5 million and we can throw that around.</P>
      <P>If &euro;5 million were available for last year's football championship, and Westmeath, which had a fantastic run and entertained us all so well, got even a small proportion of that, then we would not have to be involved in fund-raising efforts to cover the costs of those players' involvement. The county board deficit is around £200,000 for last year. Why can this sum which the Minister calls &ldquo;not very significant&rdquo; not be made available to teams like that? This measure is anti-Gaelic games. A few people will benefit from this provision and I question the value of giving it to them. If the Minister wants to take an interest in sport then he should give sport what it is due. The Minister should look at our national games and think of a way of making a return to those.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath has provided a good introduction to my contribution. Before dealing with the provision for professional sports people, I will briefly refer to the Bill and the economic circumstances we are now experiencing. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, took cognisance of the speech made by Deputy O'Malley at last weekend's Progressive Democrats conference. Deputy O'Malley is someone to whom I would certainly listen. It was his last conference and one would think that he would be going out in glory and looking back at the achievements of the Progressive Democrats. He emphasised one aspect of current financial strategy, namely, spending. The alarm bells should be ringing at this stage because spending has gone out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The rainbow Government, which was highly criticised, was very disciplined in its spending. If it had been more flaithiúil with its spending it would probably still be in Government. The few spending proposals Fine Gael would have if it were to get into office are minuscule compared to some of the provisions&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Eircom proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eircom provision is very fair. When Deputy Power knocks on doors, he will hear all about the scam pulled on the people. The taxpayer netted £4.3 billion from the Eircom debacle. Fine Gael's proposal would return &euro;80 million, at most, to those people who were duped into buying shares by an unprecedented publicity campaign led by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. People are bitter about this. Fianna Fáil organised a very good campaign in the media with people telephoning radio stations; it obviously has a very good system of getting its supporters to do that. The plan worked, but the day of reckoning will come and Fianna Fáil will have to answer to the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell pointed out that the Minister for Finance has presided over a 22% increase in current expenditure without taking corrective action, while revenue has only increased by 2%. That is quite alarming. I agree with Deputy O'Malley that spending is now spiralling. If the Government does not take corrective action then the next Minister for Finance will have a very difficult job in next year's budget. The Minister for Finance has already recognised there will be a deficit of approximately £3 billion. If spending has gone out of control, it is reasonable to forecast that could rise to anything up to £5 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some very wealthy people in this society have benefited a great deal over the past five years. As I said previously, when the Government came into office it was like taking over a team such as Manchester United. Everything was set up for <Col N="664" /> them. My Government was creating 1,000 jobs a week at that time.</P>

      <P>Those of us who talk to teachers, whose morale the Government has deliberately attacked, know that they, more than any other group of people, shape the future sports people of this country.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 makes provision for relief from income tax in respect of certain earnings of sports <Col N="665" /> persons listed in schedule 23(<i>a</i>). The various sports persons mentioned are athletes, badminton players, boxers, cyclists, footballers, golfers, jockeys, motor racing drivers, rugby players, squash players, swimmers and tennis players. There are approximately 75 national umbrella sporting organisations and the list excludes many of those. In the weeks ahead, we will hear from many of those sports organisations. While I welcome the provision, it is not fair in its application. By virtue of their exclusion, people will be discriminated against and hurt by this provision. If the Minister was going to introduce this measure, he should have done so properly. He should have ensured that there were no victims and that nobody would be excluded. The additional numbers which would have been involved may not be numerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance mentioned that these tax breaks are similar to those enjoyed by artists. No differentiation is made between artists in the provision which applies to them so why are distinctions being drawn between sports people? The Minister said it was a way of rewarding sportsmen and women for the prestige they bring to Ireland. Many more sports people bring prestige to Ireland in addition to those in the categories outlined.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Power is an ardent Gaelic football follower and he can see the efforts put in by Kildare in recent years to try to win glory for that county. This has been one of the greatest ever kicks in the teeth for Gaelic players who have been totally isolated. There is no comparison between the revenue earning capacity of Gaelic football and hurling and that of all other sports combined. Gaelic games are played in every corner of every parish in every town in the country. While I am delighted players in other codes, such as soccer and rugby, are rewarded and recognised in this provision, those codes do not have the widespread earning capacity the GAA has. I am not surprised the players' representative association is very annoyed by this provision. A head of steam is building up on this issue and I have begun to receive phone calls on it already.</P>
    <P>Tom Humphries wrote an appropriate article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday in which he compared Pádraig Harrington, who is a fine sportsman, with Dessie Farrell and asked why one should be favoured over the other. It sums up this issue and I advise Deputy Power and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to read the article. This is a flawed provision. Some system of credits should be devised between now and Committee Stage for inter-county Gaelic footballers. I will advise the Minister or his officials on it.</P>

      <P>This is the last Finance Bill before the general election. As a backbench member of the main party in Government, I believe we can be proud of much of what we have achieved in the past five years and we can maintain that pride as we head into the general election. We have created more than 300,000 jobs, reduced unemployment and made major changes to the tax system. Most people are better off as a result of measures taken by the Government. That is not to say it was not difficult. Certainly moneys were available to the Government which afforded it a luxury that previous Administrations did not have. By and large, the money was spent wisely and this has put the country in a good position.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, we would be foolish to pretend to the electorate that everything was rosy in the garden. The country still faces many problems and it is important that parties draw up policies to tackle these. I have in mind roads, traffic problems, housing problems and the ongoing problems in the health service, despite the fact that the moneys made available to it have been more than doubled. The Minister for Health and Children outlined these problems when he published his health strategy recently. Despite the fact that there has been a huge increase in capital expenditure under the Department of Education and Science, we cannot deny that there are still schools in every constituency in need of repair or, in some cases, replacement. I know they will be anxious to make their point as loudly and clearly as possible between now and the general election. The population in Kildare continues to grow and, rather than have empty classrooms, we need extra ones.</P>
      <P>The Government introduced certain measures in its lifetime which gave us particular satisfaction, such as the huge increases in social welfare payments, especially the old age pension. We promised in the beginning that we would increase that to £100 and were told at the time by many economic forecasters that it was not possible. We achieved that objective long before people thought it could be done. The huge increases in children's allowance has given families greater comfort. While there has been much criticism of child care provision and there are no easy solutions to it, given all the studies which have been conducted, one of the best ways of helping people to help themselves in this regard is through the children's allowance. The measures taken by the Government have been well received throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the tremendous contribution the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has made. He has been pilloried inside and outside the House, often unnecessarily and unfairly. He will be seen as someone who had a vision of what he wanted to achieve when he came into office and who had <Col N="667" /> his own ideas about how to go about it. One of the first decisions he made was to change the rate of capital gains tax, for which he was lacerated, particularly by the Labour Party. However, as he predicted, it was a self-financing tax reduction and one which, in a short time, succeeded in bringing in more revenue. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has been a reforming Minister. I know Deputy Durkan will agree with me when I say that he has not neglected Kildare during his term in charge of the purse strings, and we thank him for that.</P>

      <P>We are fortunate in that we have a Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and a Minister for Finance who have been very much involved and in love with the horse racing and greyhound industries. Both industries have received much attention from the Government. To a large extent, their future funding has been guaranteed. This and the establishment of a new racing authority has allowed for long-term strategies to be put in place for the greyhound and horse racing industries. Tremendous progress has been made in that facilities at tracks have been greatly improved. Punters are, to a large extent, very happy and pleased with these new facilities.</P>
      <P>The most important people in the racing industry are stable staff. Last year, 2,816 such people were employed in the industry. Many of them must travel to race courses to lead out racehorses. It may appear to be a lovely job in summer to lead horses around a parade ring but, unfortunately, given the weather here, these people must often work in very cold and damp conditions. Some of the facilities at race tracks are disgraceful. The majority of race tracks would not pass the health and safety standards we have laid down. It is important this matter is addressed. I realise it does not make economic sense to spend money on race tracks where meetings are only held a few times a year. However, at other race tracks where meetings are held regularly, facilities which any other industry would demand should be afforded to stable staff. They are the neglected and forgotten people in the racing industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in establishing the new board, agreed to appoint to the board a representative of the stable staff, Mr. Dan Kirwan. I wish him well in his efforts. Much work must be done and I hope we will see some short-term measures taken to rectify the huge wrong which exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RACE, which was established more than 20 years ago and is located at the edge of the Curragh, has been a tremendous success. Such small successes often do not get the headlines they deserve. The thinking behind its establishment <Col N="668" /> was to educate young people in the widest sense in the racing industry while also covering other subjects they would learn in school. In the past many people entered the racing industry at a very young age with very little education. RACE was intended to provide them with a basic education and a wider knowledge of racing in order that those who would not become top jockeys would find employment elsewhere in the industry. The centre has succeeded in finding employment for almost all of its former pupils. Visitors from Japan have visited and sought expertise from it. There are six Turkish students there at present.</P>
    <P>Tremendous progress has been made in the racing industry. The Minister has been criticised for the commitments he has made to it, but anyone who has a knowledge of racing, particularly the betting industry, will realise that the tax reductions were necessary if the industry was to remain competitive in an open market where Internet betting facilities were available.</P>
    <P>In recent months we have seen attempts by An Taisce to object to grants of planning permission for one-off houses in rural areas. This has caused enormous problems in County Kildare and other parts of the country. Kildare County Council invited An Taisce to come and explain its actions, but despite the appeals of councillors the organisation's policy does not seem to have changed. An Taisce's objections give no consideration to the merits of applicants for planning permission. A neighbour of mine sought permission to build a house on the family farm where she was born and reared. She qualifies as a suitable applicant under the terms of the county development plan and Kildare County Council granted her and her husband planning permission. However, An Taisce objected. Ordinary people like my neighbour are frustrated by the actions of groups such as An Taisce when they behave in such a despicable fashion. Hundreds of people have been treated in a similar manner by An Taisce.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced the list of towns to be included in the RAPID programme. Athy was fortunate enough to be included. The purpose of the programme is to generate economic activity and development and provide opportunities for communities which have not benefited from economic progress to the same extent as others. A developer lodged an application with Kildare County Council to build a hotel in Athy, a basic facility which the town does not have. The county council granted planning permission, but Dúchas lodged an objection with An Bord Pleanála. The objection was accepted and the hotel will not now be allowed.</P>
    <P>As a public representative for south Kildare, I find it fustrating that while Kildare County Council, Enterprise Ireland and other bodies are doing their best to facilitate development in Athy, a town which is the unemployment black spot of County Kildare, groups such as Dúchas are going out of their way to ensure that progress is stopped. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for <Col N="669" /> Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to become involved in this problem and make Dúchas and An Taisce account for their actions. As long as these bodies continue with their present policies, their funding should be withdrawn. Their behaviour shows an ignorance of rural life and the needs of communities.</P>
    <P>When in opposition the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform brought forward a number of anti-crime policies which appealed to the electorate. He has implemented a number of them. The number of gardaí has been increased from 10,800 in 1997 to more than 11,700 at present. By the end of the year the figure will have reached 12,000. Despite this, the number of violent incidents outside places of entertainment, particularly food outlets, has grown and become a worry in many parts of the country. The Criminal Justice (Public Order Enforcement) Bill will help to solve this problem, but we must reconsider the opening hours of fast food outlets where people congregate when they are full of alcohol and looking for trouble. I hope we can deal with this situation quickly.</P>

        <b>: </b>I welcome the speech of the Minister for Finance on Second Stage of the Finance Bill, in which he outlined the many achievements of the past year and his proposals for the future. He has introduced his fifth budget and improved the country's finances and the financial circumstances of all its citizens. He made decisions and stuck to his guns, even when he was criticised by members of his own party. Many changes have taken place which have benefited communities throughout the country. Taxes have been reduced and there is now an incentive to work. There are now 300,000 more people at work than in 1997. The economic difficulties of recent months are short-term and I hope people will continue to have an opportunity to work in Ireland. We remember the early 1990s when many of our young people were working in Boston, London and throughout the world. In recent weeks when Deputies have been canvassing for the forthcoming general election we find that many young people have returned home and are working, earning a good living and are not subject to the high tax rates of the past.</P>
      <P>It is right that old age pensioners should receive a substantial increase in pension payments when times are good. In the 1980s and early 1990s they were given miserable increases of 1%, 2% and 3%.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the previous Government, efforts were being made to increase social welfare payments, particularly old age pensions, disability allowances, invalidity pensions and children's allowances, which were increased substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on the substantial increases allocated to widows in recent years. This is something all Deputies sought for some time but previous Ministers for Finance and Ministers for Social Welfare did not take the matter on board. I compliment the Mini<Col N="670" /> ster for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, in this regard. Widows were living on a very small allowance up to a couple of years ago and I hope the Minister will continue to increase this allowance. My mother was a widow with eight children at a very young age. At 18 years of age I was the oldest of the family. Social welfare payments at the time were very small. It was a major culture shock when the breadwinner died and one found oneself going from an income to a very small social welfare payment. After becoming Minister for Finance I recall Deputy McCreevy saying he would do something to improve the lot of widows and widowers, which I recognise today.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies on the other side of the House are making great play about what Deputy O'Malley said at the Progressive Democrats Árd Fheis, which is that we are spending too much. Perhaps it was a bowing out speech.</P>

        <b>: </b>On the other hand, we would all like the Minister for Finance to allocate more money to our constituencies. We are all critical that schools and hospitals in our areas have not been built and that other developments are not taking place. We cannot have it both ways. If we want the Minister to spend money we cannot come in here and say Deputy O'Malley was correct. I do not think Deputy O'Malley was correct but I think the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is getting it right. I hope where there is a need he will continue to allocate money for projects in constituencies throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes in regard to the section 23 relief under both the urban renewal scheme and the town renewal scheme. The fact that section 23 relief was not included meant it was not very lucrative for developers to get involved. This major change must be welcomed. Ten years ago Enniscorthy town was on its knees but it received urban renewal status in 1993. Over the past seven or eight years two new hotels, a swimming pool, cinemas, shops, apartments and other developments resulted from receiving urban renewal status. I would like the Minister to revisit some of the towns which had urban renewal status in the early 1990s. These were success stories, but much work still needs to be done. I ask him to consider seriously returning to towns such as Wexford, Enniscorthy and so on which have benefited in the past but need further incentives for developers to complete the job, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the rural renewal scheme in counties such as Wexford. Towns such as Gorey, Bunclody and Taghmon were designated under the scheme. It is slow to get off the ground because investors do not seem to be as interested in smaller towns. I believe that local authorities are not putting the same emphasis on driving the rural renewal scheme to the same extent as the urban renewal scheme. Perhaps the <Col N="671" /> Minister for the Environment and Local Government will consider telling county managers to push for the development of towns in rural areas. This is a very worthwhile scheme but the uptake seems to be slow at present.</P>
    <P>The tax relief for sportspersons is drumming up a certain amount of debate and heat. I welcome this measure. As the Minister said the other day, these people only earn income for a short period. However, I have serious concerns about GAA players. I accept it is difficult to give tax relief to people who do not receive payment. It may take some ingenuity on the part of the Minister for Finance to get around this matter. Certainly amateur GAA players, including most county and club players &ndash; I am more involved in the GAA than in other areas &ndash; and other amateur players train four or five nights a week. They play games on Sunday and become involved in meetings and team talks which means that a lot of their time is taken up with the game. The Minister must seriously consider tax relief for sponsorship, appearance fees and endorsements. County boards must now buy their way to success by taking on county team managers. In Wexford it costs approximately £150,000 to train a team. Westmeath was successful in senior football last year but I read somewhere that it cost approximately £200,000 to train a team which did not win anything &ndash; neither did Wexford win anything.</P>

        <b>: </b>We will win three seats in the general election. However, we were not successful on the playing field other than getting to an All-Ireland hurling semi-final, which I suppose is success in itself.</P>
      <P>Members of the GAA who are involved on a voluntary basis are the unpaid social workers of this country. As Deputies Deenihan and Power said, there is a GAA club in every parish. People are involved on a voluntary basis looking after thousands of young people throughout the country. They use their cars and give up endless hours keeping young people off the streets, for which there should be recognition. The Minister was criticised for putting a lot of money into Croke Park, for which he should make no apology. Why should the GAA not receive lottery funds the same as everyone else? However, I would ask him to consider some way of recognising the role of GAA players. He made it very clear during the week that if one is not being paid he cannot give tax relief, which I accept is a difficulty, but he should consider what other reliefs can be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt briefly with farmer taxation. He is extending the definition of &ldquo;qualifying quota&rdquo; to qualify for relief under the capital allowance scheme for the purchase of milk quota. There is also a demand for relief for farmers who purchase beet quota. I am sure there are many beet growers in Deputy Durkan's constituency <Col N="672" /> and the IFA and beet growers have probably been in touch with him, as they have been with a number of Deputies in the south-east. I ask the Minister to make similar provision for farmers who purchase beet quota as is the case with milk quota. I believe it has been introduced in the UK. Perhaps the Revenue Commissioners, together with the Minister, will look at the system in the UK to see what is available to farmers.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister promised to consider the issue of inheritance tax in respect of caravan park owners, which is more relevant to coastal counties. There are many caravan park owners along the coastline, including in the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan's, area. When a young person takes over the family business of a caravan park he or she is not allowed business relief, which is a crazy decision. It is the only business I know of which has been excluded from relief in the business area. For some reason, the Revenue Commissioners have always refused to allow business relief in this area. The majority of caravan park owners in County Carlow &ndash; I am sure it is the same in every other county &ndash; run family businesses. They are run by the father, mother and a son or two. If the parents want to pass on the business to a son or daughter, they are taxed out of existence. In some areas, the caravan parks include a bar and shop. The owners are allowed business relief on the bar and shop, but when it comes to leaving the caravan park business to the son or daughter, they are not allowed to claim the business relief on tax. Will the Minister examine this because people will not be in a position to leave their caravan park businesses to their sons or daughters because they will not be able to pay the tax? They will have to sell the businesses. That is a crazy system.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, on his work in the past five years. I am sure he will be returned to that position after the general election in May and he will have another five years to continue the excellent work he has been doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some positive aspects to the Finance Bill, the legislation which gives statutory effect to the budget. It has been talked about almost constantly since the budget, along with the budget's implications and impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of matters that stretch my imagination. It is important to realise how the public feels now compared to five years ago. Deputy O'Malley's speech at the Árd Fheis at the weekend seems to confirm this. Obviously, the Government made a decision to cut expenditure on housing, health, education, orthodontics and <Col N="673" /> all the services that are crucial as far as the general public is concerned. It is true that there was a lot of money to spend. I am not saying the use to which the money was put was wrong but there is no doubt a conscious decision was made. Whatever the cause or whoever the driving force, I do not know.</P>
    <P>For almost three years in a row, we had extraordinary budgetary surpluses &ndash; bigger than any in the nation's history. That was seen as a positive thing, and it was, but that happened only because there were shortages under the other main headings to which I referred. Therefore, it was easy to have surpluses because the money was not being spent in the areas in which it should have been.</P>
    <P>Every time a Minister makes an announcement &ndash; be it the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs or anybody else &ndash; that a certain sum of money is the largest ever presented since the foundation of the State, of course he or she is correct. Unless the Minister is a lunatic, he or she would not come into the House and propose a cut under any heading because he or she would not get away with it. When there is so much money to spend, what else could be expected but expenditure above and beyond anything ever experienced in the State?</P>
    <P>It is frequently stated that huge sums of money are being spent on the health services. While fairly substantial amounts of money are being spent in that area, it must be noted that it is more expensive to run a service for a bigger community. There are more people in the country and more calls on the service. One could not run the health services with the kind of structure that existed in the 1950s. The population has almost doubled since then. There are major differences since then which very few people have recognised. In the past eight or nine years the Administration has failed to recognise that as the economy and population grow competing demands also grow. If one does not allow one area of the economy to progress and allows the rest go forward, there is a price to be paid. In my own constituency there are approximately 2,500 families on housing waiting lists. There are another 1,000 or 1,500 families with an income of up to £50,000 per annum who cannot buy houses. Neither group can buy houses. The latter group is now converging on the housing list as well as everybody else. They are desperate &ndash; it is as simple as that. The normal criterion for obtaining a housing loan is that the applicant is entitled to 2.5 times his or her gross income. Two and a half times £50,000 &ndash; which is a reasonable salary for a one income household &ndash; will entitle the applicant to £125,000. One cannot buy a house in my constituency for £125,000. The cheapest is about £135,000. If a first-time buyer opts for a house in need of repair, he or she will be lucky to get it for £125,000. The maximum loan available from the local authority is £100,000. One might as well give the people nothing. There is total and abject neglect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" />The needs of a particularly large group of people &ndash; 2,500 families on one side and 1,500 on the other &ndash; are at stake. This number of people corresponds to a seat in most constituencies. At the end of another five years, if we continue as we are, the people who are now living in hope will have lost all hope and there will be nothing for them. They will have to emigrate to get a house. That is crazy. I cannot understand why the Government has not tried to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The Government has opted out of housing. It is presumed a plethora of voluntary agencies will take up the slack and provide for people. The Government has responsibility for the public housing programme. That was always the case. Opting out and saying voluntary agencies can do X, Y, and Z is wrong. They cannot; it must be driven by Government. If it is not driven by Government it will not happen. In 1988, the housing programme was abolished A programme that was able to deliver a ready number of houses per annum in most counties was abolished and nothing was delivered. Every increase on nothing was 100%. When there were only ten houses built, it was easy to increase that by 100%.</P>
    <P>Five years ago in this House I said the economic policy being pursued would lead to naught, that it would certainly crush a lot of people and that it had not worked in any country in which it was tried. The only place of which we had direct knowledge and a vision was our next door neighbour, where Margaret Thatcher tried a similar economic policy for a number of years and it failed. In 1977 there was a general election and the major Government party at that time said there was mismanagement and bad decisions, that the economy was in tatters, that there was not really an unemployment problem and that the oil crisis did not happen. Deputy Roche would have been very familiar with the scripts at that time. He was part of the think tank.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy was not thinking at the time. In any event in June 1977 it was alleged that with proper management this country could be put on its feet again, as the slogan stated. After 18 months everything fell flat and expenditure went through the roof. The same tactics are being employed now and unfortunately the same end product will emerge. The people paid then and they will pay again only this time they are paying much more quickly. The hospital services have not been delivered and the people who are not getting those services are paying now. The people without houses at present are paying. The children who have sought orthodontic treatment for four years have been neglected and are paying now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the late 1970s inflation went dramatically upwards to 22%. There was a change of leadership in the Government party, but nothing happened and it continued to <Col N="675" /> increase. In 1981 the people shouted stop, said they could not tolerate any more and threw that Government out of office. It took four years of giving to the people based on the slogan of putting more money in the people's pockets&mdash;</P>

      <P>We should ask the Eircom investors how much money was put in their pockets, who put it there and to whom was it given when it was taken out. The Government spent £78 million in promoting the Eircom share flotation. It was a great idea, it said. It was not possible to pay too much for a national institution like that. The people patriotically wanted to invest in a national institution and be seen to support the nation. They took the Government's cue and accepted what was said to them. They went to the post offices and withdrew savings. They brought their children in by the hands and told them to invest in this in order to have something when they reached 21 years of age. Old age pensioners who never had a bob before borrowed money from their banks to invest in a national asset, believing it would be valuable when they eventually got to sign it over.</P>
      <P>What happened? They got a letter in the post instructing them to sell their shares at approximately two thirds of the amount they had paid. This was not mentioned in the £78 million campaign advertising the flotation. When those on the Government benches decide to criticise other parties for attempting to at least make some amends for it, they should not forget what happened to those people. Some 7,000 people have paid a great price for that massive debacle. The final insult was that the people not merely bought something on the marketplace, they bought something they owned already. The Government sold the people something they owned already. The £78 million was spent to make the people feel good when they were investing.</P>

      <P>I have a feeling that the people will be inside waiting for them. It will be no good for Deputy Roche to say he was part of a think <Col N="676" /> tank in 1977. That will not be regarded as a defence.</P>
      <P>Let us consider education. Of course education requires significant funding, but if it does not receive it, we are not doing our jobs. It is a major investment and a vital part of the jigsaw. If there is not sufficient investment in education, at some stage in the future we will pay a heavy price for it. The manner and methodology used by the Government in dealing with the education system and teachers' disputes in recent years have resulted in it becoming unstuck. Unless something is done as a matter of urgency to heal those wounds and look after the educational system in the shortest time there will be a serious problem. I do not mind what the electorate will do to the Government parties. However, irreparable damage will be done to the whole teaching structure and the danger is that it will no longer be an attractive profession and people will leave it as they are already doing. If that continues some future Government will have to tackle the resultant problems, which will be serious.</P>
      <P>I would never have thought at times of unprecedented budgetary surpluses for a succession of years that somebody would suddenly say there was a problem and there would be a deficit the following year. However, true to form, the Government is full of surprises and has told us that next year there will be a fairly substantial deficit. I would not like to be in the shoes of whoever is sitting on the other side of the House after the election and who has to tell the people that at the end of the next year they will have to pay for the Government policies of the past five years. That will be a sticky wicket and I wish them all the best with it.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority has announced that it has run out of money for new road programmes. That is the strangest thing I have ever heard at a time when it is clear the infrastructure in this country is substandard by comparison with most other European countries, some of which did not even have a democracy until recently. Given the economic advantages of the Celtic tiger roaring up every hill and valley for the past five years, it is extraordinary that the National Roads Authority has run out of money for new roads projects. That will have a major impact over the next four years.</P>
      <P>When people look back at the taxation policies of the Government they will ask why things were done that way and what was the Government thinking of. They will ask why the Government left the country in such a way that one year after leaving office there will be a major deficit of probably about &euro;3 billion. I wish the two Government parties the very best of luck. I recommend that Members on the Government side wear strong leather leggings because when they meet the public they will find the dogs are trained to bite regularly. I advise them to bring protection.</P>

      <P>I want to mention people with disabilities. Like others, I would have thought that at a time when there was unlimited money available, it would have been simple for the Government to ensure that people with disabilities would have no worries in the future. The Bill is a disappointment. It does not address the needs of people with disabilities who are back where they started four years ago.</P>
      <P>My colleagues mentioned the value of amateur sports. When recognition is being given, amateur sportspersons are as entitled to tax concessions as anybody else. I cannot understand why that is not a central part of the Government's strategy.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing his fifth budget and Finance Bill, but extend my deepest sympathy to the people opposite because the Government has made such a mess of handling so much money in such a short space of time and left many people disappointed. Many people employed public relations consultants to get across as solemn and solid a message as possible and failed to do it, but the Government has done it successfully and satisfactorily. It thinks it is going to the country with a light heart, but it should beware. The public have not spoken yet, but they soon will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. One of the issues that hit the headlines in recent days is the tax concession that will be given to sportspeople. I do not know from where the demand to introduce that concession came. I would like the Minister to explain to the House and to the people the urgent demand for it. We can all think of matters that would rank higher in priority than this one.</P>
      <P>On the 6 o'clock news it was announced that nurses in eight to ten hospitals, including Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in Mullingar in which I am interested, will take industrial action. A building in that hospital has been left untouched and empty for the past four and a half years. It is a monument to the Government that is interested in giving tax concessions to sportspeople.</P>
      <P>Many people are annoyed about this measure, including every member of the GAA throughout the length and breadth of the country. The Government has turned against the GAA and all those associated with it. Deputy Roche may laugh, but I know many people whose sports careers were cut short through injury at a very early stage. They did not get, nor did they expect, any concession. If the Minister was genuinely interested in doing something for sport, which seems to be what he is talking about, there are many other ways he could have done so. I hope he will explain this measure. It appears to have been introduced to suit a certain select few. That does not represent good government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" />I tabled three questions to the Minister for Education and Science regarding Ballymahon school, Lanesboro school and Clontumpher national school. I was advised the cases are being examined and they will be addressed under the programme, but nothing is happening. That is more evidence of the Government's poor record.</P>
    <P>When the Government came into power, the Celtic tiger was in tip top form across the length and breadth of the country. The Government inherited an economy that was in good stead, which nobody can deny. When the Minister for Finance spun the cards on the table and said at a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting that the game was up and that they would have to face the facts, there was uproar and panic. Instead of doing what the Minister did before when the members walked out on the plinth and took him on, he decided on this occasion, because an election was coming up, to get out the bandages, plaster over things as best he could as there was only a few months to go, put a good face on it and everything would be grand. That is exactly what happened.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.8 billion went missing last year. The Minister had budgeted for that amount, but the money was not there. It disappeared. What happened to it? Is that the record of a responsible Minister of Finance and Government that is asking the people to put them back into power? I do not think so. I do not think the people will put them back into power.</P>
    <P>The rural renewal scheme gave a major boost to the midlands. I am glad the Minister extended the scheme for another two years. Areas throughout the country, such as County Longford and parts of Roscommon, needed an extra boost and the scheme helped uplift economic life in those areas.</P>
    <P>My party has a genuine reason to give Eircom shareholders back some of the money they lost on their share investment. All kinds of snide remarks were made to the effect that if one backed a horse, one cannot expect to get one's money back. If the Government wrote to everyone in the country and spent, as Deputy Durkan said, £78 million, telling people to back Florida Pearl in the Gold Cup and if Florida Pearl did not win, I guarantee that the people would say they wanted their money back because the Government wrote and told them to back Florida Pearl. That is what would happen and that is what happened in this case. My party is saying that the shareholders are entitled to some of their money back because that share purchase was not an ordinary case of gambling on the Stock Exchange. The people were asked to invest in Government stock at the request of the Government. The hype will always be remembered by the people. The Taoiseach, the Minister and the former Minister appeared on the plinth and stated: &ldquo;Happy days are here again, roll on, roll on, roll on.&rdquo;  The day people bought those shares was a sad day, which the people will not forget. When they go to the <Col N="679" /> polls, they will give the Deputies opposite their answer in no uncertain fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said that the Luas project was effectively abandoned and I reiterate that. It was replaced with one token line that will run from Tallaght to St. Stephen's Green. The only reason that token line was left in was to save face for the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who failed to put the metro proposal into operation. It was replaced by an announcement by Government that a new metro system would be put in place and would be available after 16 years. My views on the incompetence and disastrous tenure of Deputy O'Rourke as Minister for Public Enterprise are well known and have been expressed in this House on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available I want to refer to the principles that will inform the Labour Party's approach to public transport rather than waste my time reviewing the record of a Minister who, <Col N="681" /> luckily, will be out of office in a few weeks' time. The Labour Party believes that four key principles should be the cornerstone of public transport policy. Those principles are sustainability, social inclusion, urban citizenship and fostering genuine growth. Those principles will inform the Labour Party approach to this issue in the coming years. In my brief contribution, I will confine my remarks to the transport challenges facing the greater Dublin area. However, the Labour Party does not believe public transport is solely an issue for Dublin, Cork or other major urban centres. We recognise the chronic lack of public transport that afflicts rural Ireland and it is not an issue we will ignore.</P>
    <P>Over the lifetime of this Government the transport situation in the greater Dublin area has deteriorated on a huge scale. The Government has adopted a ramshackle approach to it. The only clear Government line comes from the Ministers, Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Harney, and that is part of the problem. That wing of the Government is opposed to the concept of public transport while paying lip service to it.</P>
    <P>To tackle the mess this Government will have left behind, the Labour Party proposes the establishment of a greater Dublin regional authority that will encompass the administrative areas of Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Dublin. This authority is essential if we are to overcome the administrative and structural confusion that is a hallmark of Dublin's transport policy at present. It would be an elected authority with a democratic remit.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will also strongly advocate the front loading of public transport investment. Fianna Fáil's failure in relation to Luas, quality bus corridors and to rail and bus investment will be reversed. Public transport investment must be front loaded to achieve the implementation of the Dublin Transportation Office plan. The Labour Party is determined to provide the capital funding to ensure the huge gaps in the capital's infrastructure will no longer exist. We will invest in a high speed rail link to Dublin Airport, the third phase of Luas and integrated ticketing. We will provide the citizens of Dublin and beyond with a public transport infrastructure that will remove the near total reliance on the private car.</P>
    <P>Some speakers in this debate have taken the Progressive Democrats line that privatisation and competition is the quick and easy solution to public transport problems in Dublin. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Labour Party will examine the structure and management within the CIE group of companies but it will not contemplate privatisation. We do not believe the handing over of public transport operations to private capital is in the best interests of consumers. Privatisation will lead, as we saw in Britain, to cherry picking, profit chasing and a deterioration in services to citizens, particularly commuters.</P>
    <P>The last few years have, at last, seen the introduction of quality bus corridors in the Dublin <Col N="682" /> region. The completion of the quality bus corridor network is behind schedule but where it is in place, it provides a fine service to commuters. This is public road space reserved for public transport services in the public interest. Is this public space, which is owned by the people and which has been reserved for public transport after a long campaign, to be handed over to private capital and the pursuit of profit? It makes no sense in terms of public transport, it only makes business sense for a small minority of entrepreneurs. However, we know the influence certain entrepreneurs have among senior Ministers in this Government and we saw examples of it in the past few days.</P>
    <P>I give the House a commitment that the Labour Party in Government will purchase sufficient buses, the workhorses of public transport, to fill the bus lanes and to provide a quality public transport system for the citizens of this city and beyond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party. The Fine Gael suggestion that this Government has failed to address transport issues in urban centres is simply false. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, defended the Government's policies in the transport area and outlined what is being achieved to alleviate traffic congestion in our capital city and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In recent years the Irish economy has grown at a substantial rate and this has brought new challenges in terms of addressing different transport problems. More traffic on the roads has certainly strained existing road networks and the Government is aware of the absolute importance of developing local, secondary and national road networks to a greater extent. Car ownership has increased by 40% since 1992, with more than 1.2 million private cars now on our roads. The Government is aware of the work that must be carried out on the road network to guarantee that the roads are brought up to a higher standard and can be maintained as traffic volume increases.</P>
      <P>There are nearly 6,000 kilometres of primary and secondary roads in Ireland and more than 90,000 kilometres of regional and local roads. The primary objectives of the Government's road transport policy are to improve bottlenecks and reduce journey times; to improve internal road transport between regions and within regions, which will help to foster more balanced regional development; to facilitate better access to and from ports and airports to offset the negative effects of peripherality; to contribute to sustainable transport policies by continued economic growth and regional development while ensuring a high level of environmental protection; and to achieve the objectives of the Government's road safety strategy in relation to the reduction of fatalities and serious injuries caused by road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of this integrated transport investment programme are set out in the National <Col N="683" /> Development Plan 2000-2006. Key features of this programme include a focused development strategy for our national primary road network and improvement of national secondary roads, which is of critical importance for economic development and balanced regional development. Equally, the Government is committed to improving the quality of county and regional road networks which play such an important role in the economic life of so many people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the figures released by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, last month outlining expenditure plans for 2002 as part of the national roads programme. These figures clearly demonstrate that actual expenditure has exceeded the national development plan forecasts by more than 10%. The national development plan for the year 2002 forecast spending of &euro;922 million on national roads while actual expenditure for this year will be &euro;950 million. The plan forecast spending of &euro;520 million in 2000 and &euro;780 million in 2001 while actual expenditure for these years was &euro;622 million and &euro;907 million, respectively. The expenditure this year will be maintained notwithstanding the more challenging economic conditions that prevail at present.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the construction industry. In the budget last December, tax incentives were introduced which will help the construction industry to deal with the changing economic environment. The construction industry is growing, but at a more sustainable level. In the Department of the Environment and Local Government's annual review, Construction Industry &ndash; Review 2001, Outlook 2001 &ndash; 2003, there were some key findings. Growth in the volume of building output was almost 3% in 2001 and continued growth in building output is projected at 3% in both 2002 and 2003. Direct employment in the construction industry continues to grow and had reached 180,000 people by the end of 2001. Construction output in Ireland is estimated at 17% of GDP, which demonstrates the important role this sector plays in our economy.</P>
    <P>In addition, &euro;2.7 million is being spent per day on the national roads improvement and maintenance programme. This maintains investment in the national road network at a high level, more than three times higher than the 1997 level of &euro;324 million.</P>
    <P>A cornerstone of Government policy is a commitment to balance regional development, as it does not want to widen the gap between rural and urban Ireland. We have implemented wide-ranging programmes to support rural towns and communities. Its commitment to implementing a new spatial strategy will ensure that rural towns will develop in a sustainable and structured manner.</P>
    <P>A measure which will ensure the success of this strategy is increased support for the development <Col N="684" /> of our county and rural road network. Contrary to what the Opposition may say, the Government has substantially increased the level of grant allocations for the development of these roads. On 18 January last, it announced an increase of 9.4% in grants for non-national roads in 2002. The Opposition does not like statistics which demonstrate the Government's commitment to local roads. In 2002, &euro;438 million was provided for non-national roads, double the 1997 allocation of &euro;219 million by the rainbow Government. As a Member for Limerick West, I recognise the important role that rural roads play in our daily lives. County roads are the key transport arteries for rural communities and the Government's support for this network must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to a strong regional policy means that the local secondary and national road network in areas such as the mid-west and County Limerick are being improved substantially. In my constituency, the national development plan is injecting substantial funding to upgrade the following road network &ndash; Limerick, Askeaton, Foynes, Glin, Listowel, Tralee &ndash; the N69, Abbeyfeale, Newcastle West, Rathkeel, Adare, Patrickswell to Limerick &ndash; N21, and the Charleville-Croom-Patrickswell road. Substantial progress has been made in upgrading the road from Adare to Limerick, while a bypass will circle the city to the south.</P>
    <P>Such networks are important if we are to have balanced investment in all areas. If inward and indigenous investment for areas such as County Limerick is to be secured, key infrastructures such as roads and telecommunications must be of the highest standards. This is important to ensure that we remain competitive in a challenging economic climate. The Government is committed to ensuring that job creation is achieved in all rural and urban areas and a vibrant, successful transport network is a key element of that.</P>
    <P>As I stated before, a vital part of the Government's strategy is to ensure better access to our main ports and airports. I, therefore, welcome the allocation of over &euro;1 million to upgrade facilities at Foynes harbour, County Limerick, an extremely important port on the western seaboard. The Government is also developing road access to the port to ensure that cargo unloaded there reaches its market destination quickly. The Government also has a strong airport policy and Shannon is now home to more than two million passengers a year. Ports, airports and roads are central cogs in ensuring that the Government has a successful transport policy.</P>
    <P>No one can deny that the rapid growth in the economy did not bring difficulties. The massive increase in car use meant that the Government had to act quickly to ensure that all elements of transport operated effectively.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to that network is also matched by a commitment to road safety. Road deaths are too high and the Government's road safety strategy, the first of its kind, has helped reduce the level of fatalities. A strong <Col N="685" /> commitment to road safety must remain a central component of Government policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue and acknowledge the huge investment in transport infrastructure in the past four and a half years. Much has been achieved and much remains to be achieved. It has been achieved against a backdrop of a huge increase in the number of employed and of those returning from abroad who were given the opportunity by the economic boom to play their part and share in what was happening.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the &euro;12 billion invested in transport for the period 2000-06 and the &euro;400 million capital funding for public transport in 2002. I welcome the emphasis on the development of the regions and the need for all the country to share in the wealth. Dublin gets special mention, as do many other urban centres such as Cork, Galway and Limerick, which is correct as people living in or travelling to the capital, other urban centres and ports must have proper facilities such as the Luas, the Metro and roads.</P>
      <P>It is equally important to acknowledge that there is a growth in the numbers living in the country and commuting to Dublin or another city daily to work. They may have moved to the country for the quality of life and want proper road and rail access to their workplace. Many Members of this House cannot do that. For example, I cannot travel here daily by rail because the rail company has not upgraded the line from Kilkenny or Waterford to Dublin, despite its representatives appearing before a committee some years ago to state that it would do so. It deprives people of the public rail transport to which they are entitled. Recently, the Minister answered a question about the rail line from Waterford, but the company is not paying attention to representations made by people like me or the commuting public.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had his chance to speak and his speech, which was only about Dublin, lacked vision and policy.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the traffic problems around Dublin because of economic developments in the regions. There are traffic problems elsewhere and local authorities must invest much money in getting consultants' reports on how to manage these. There is no quick fix solution, but a costly process must be undertaken. I ask the Minister to ease the criteria for grants and make available proper funding to local authorities to get these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The completion of ring roads or outer relief roads around cities such as Kilkenny is vital. It is many years since the last leg of the Kilkenny ring road was completed. The NRA is due to announce shortly the decision on an application to complete this road. This road and a similar one planned for Carlow are the best means of dealing <Col N="686" /> with traffic in cities of that size because they remove heavy goods vehicles from the cities and improve the quality of life there.</P>
    <P>Speed of delivery is the key issue in implementing plans. The plan for Kilkenny is there and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that it is incorporated in whatever infrastructural plan is envisaged for the city. There is a great need for public private partnerships, particularly in the regions. For example, in my constituency Kavanaghs operate a bus service to Dublin and around the region and there is a need for a partnership with Bus Éireann to ensure the entire area is covered. In that way the service can be expanded and everyone can access it. It is a wonderful service for students and those who work outside Kilkenny and the south-east, but one company cannot provide such a service by itself. It needs to connect with others in the market that are providing an efficient, cost-effective service. It would do Bus Éireann no harm to engage with companies such as Kavanagh's to ensure there is an all-embracing service to the benefit of commuters.</P>
    <P>I have referred to people who must work away from home and, whether one travels by car or rail, it is important that services are available and that train times, for example, coincide with market demands. That aspect must be developed. The problem is not a lack of investment &ndash;&euro;12 billion is earmarked for the construction programme &ndash; but speed of delivery, as effected by the speed of the developing economy. We need more public private partnerships for transport and road infrastructure to ensure we get a satisfactory solution to this problem. The Government has outlined a complete package to deal with these issues. It has funded and continues to fund various initiatives, so it is now down to the speed of delivery as against a growing economy, taking into account that the economy has slowed a little in recent months. We are now in a position to deal with the issues in a more practical way.</P>

The southern cross route is all but <Col N="687" /> complete &ndash; it will be finished this evening &ndash; and there is the Balbriggan bypass. It is a great pity that previous Governments did not plan ahead like this one to ensure the M50 had the capacity that is required. Deputy Richard Bruton and I are aware of the Dublin port tunnel project, the biggest ever undertaken in the country. Of course it is causing some headaches but it will take 9,000 heavy goods vehicles a day off the streets of Dublin. That will be a major improvement and those living in Whitehall and Fairview are to be congratulated on their patience in the interests of a better city. The logical consequence of that is the continuation of the south-eastern motorway across Sandymount to link with the southern motorway.

      <P>Opposition Deputies said we did not mean what we said and we would not do what we promised, but it is being done. The Red Cow depot, as the Deputy well knows, is ready.  If one drives around St. Stephen's Green at present one will see Luas-related work in progress. The project will be completed on time. The metro will also be of great benefit to the community. We badly need a link between the city and the airport. DCU is in Deputy Bruton's and my constituency and I am determined that the Government and any future Administration in which I have a say will continue with the project&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy Mitchell listened instead of nodding her head every so often we might get somewhere.</P>
      <P>The metro cannot be built overnight, nor can the Luas. We will be judged by what we do. We have delivered Luas and we will continue to complete it. The next Government, in which Fianna Fáil will be a major partner, will also consider the metro as a significant project &ndash; it has been extended.</P>
      <P>My only complaint about the much-maligned quality bus corridors is that it takes so long for them to come on stream. Bus capacity on those routes has increased significantly and those coming on stream this year, in Ballymun and Swords, will take a huge number of car passengers onto the public transport network, which is important. Owen Keegan, the Dublin director of traffic, is much maligned but is doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My criticism is the absence of an integrated ticketing system. For example, Bus Éireann runs buses from outside Dublin where buses are operated by Dublin Bus. There is also the DART and we will have the Luas. There is a need for those to be integrated, sooner rather than later, and there should be no excuses. I compliment the <Col N="688" /> DTO for the way it has managed traffic and parking around the city. It was impossible up to three or four years ago to get a parking space anywhere in the city but now it is possible and relatively easy. One has to pay to park and sometimes one must put up with being clamped. However, traffic within the city's inner core is now moving quite freely. There are environmental traffic cells and traffic calming schemes operating in all the neighbouring areas. That has all been delivered as part of the Government's transport policy. Much has been done and much remains to be done, but that is not due to lack of investment. There is every likelihood that we will have a quality bus service which will be equal to that in any other European city. I commend the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Carey for sharing his time with me. The difference between Opposition and Government is that in government one is expected to deliver. The section of the universe occupied by the main Opposition party is a sort of Terry Pratchett parallel universe. It is important to compare the record with the reality.</P>
      <P>The track record of the rainbow coalition on public transport, whatever about its other achievements, was absolutely derisory. The Government has made the biggest single investment in public transport in the history of the State. When the last Government was in office it invested a derisory amount of money in public transport. If Opposition Deputies are so concerned about public transport and the gridlock that goes with success in the city, it is important they say why so little was done then. When Deputy Belton was speaking on the Finance Bill, he said that when the Government took office in 1997, the Celtic tiger was purring but public transport certainly was not.</P>
      <P>In the two years the rainbow coalition was in government it put less than £15 million in new investment in public transport. That is a scandalous figure and Opposition Deputies should be deeply ashamed of it. In 1999 alone the Government committed 20 times as much to public transport as the previous Government did in the best years it held office. In 2000 for the first time public investment in public transport touched the &euro;250 million mark. In 2001 public investment in transport rose to £271.5 million, &euro;345 million. The increase in the level of investment between 1996 and 2001 in public transport was 679%. Whatever one might blame the Government for, one cannot say it did not invest in public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the DART, in 1995, with a few days to go to the by-election in County Wicklow, the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, arrived in Greystones with a broken down DART carriage on the back of a railway flatbed truck and promised us the sun, moon and stars. The broken down carriage was hauled away later that night after the Minister had left. When the party opposite left office two years later not one single penny had been put aside for investment in the DART <Col N="689" /> expansion. That was a scandal because it was a specific promise given to voters in Greystones in 1995 and it was not delivered on.</P>
    <P>The DART extension to Malahide and Greystones was completed and funded during the Government's term of office. For the first time since the DART system was created, additional rolling stock has been brought in. Capacity on the DART system has been increased by 50% in the past two years. All Governments, including those in which Fianna Fáil was involved, did nothing to increase DART services.</P>

It is ludicrous for Deputies on the other side of the House or for any other apologists of that miserable Government to talk about the state of public transport in either this city or Ireland in general.</P>

      <P>Another measure of the Government's commitment to public transport is the fact that the subvention to CIE has been substantially increased. Since 2001, as Deputies John and Richard Bruton and other Deputies know, 20 new diesel cars have been delivered for the suburban rail network for the first time in years. We have 26 new DART cars while 12 new additional DART cars were delivered last autumn, which will come into operation later in the spring. The Government has done significant things to improve the quality of public rail transport, particularly commuter transport, in the city, county and surrounding counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvement in the situation at Dublin Bus is more dramatic. Some 275 additional buses and 100 replacement buses were delivered up to the end of 2000. How many were delivered when the party opposite was in charge? The answer is none. Some replacement buses were provided, but there was not any additional stock. One or two of the Opposition Deputies made one acute and correct observation. I query the fact that all the buses delivered are diesel driven. Some of the Opposition Deputies and I have argued at the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport that it is scandalous that all the buses which have been ordered by the CIE group have been diesel driven. They should be gas driven. When a del<Col N="690" /> egation from the committee went to France earlier this year we were given figures which completely questioned what had been provided by the CIE group.</P>
    <P>We must move forward with an integrated public transport system which works. It is a fact that notwithstanding the improvement in funding in systems, such as DART, services are still not up to standard. The schedule of services which were supposed to be delivered on the DART lines to Greystones and Malahide are not in place, but not because the Minister of the day has not put the money into them. There is something fundamentally wrong with management in the company which must be addressed. For the past ten to 15 years Deputies on all sides of the House have spoken about an integrated ticketing system for Dublin, but we do not have one. That is a scandal. The political will and the willingness to provide funding have been there, but I wonder where the shortfall has been.</P>
    <P>We have a complex issue in a vibrant and growing city in a hinterland which is growing dramatically. We should not engage in the type of debate in which we engage too often. We should look for solutions rather than slogans. The Government has delivered.</P>

      <P>People's quality of life will be a key, if not the key issue, in the forthcoming general election. The quality of life being led by many people in my constituency of Meath is adversely affected by the failures of our public transport system and infrastructural planning. If one is driving towards Dublin on the M50 early in the morning &ndash; I am sure it is true in other areas also &ndash; one will see a woman driving her car with her children in the back seat having their breakfast. Those children have probably got up an hour previously and will not arrive at the crèche in Dublin in which they are staying for a further hour because of traffic. They will then have to repeat the exercise in the evening. The result is that they have an extremely stressed life. When they are of schoolgoing age and their mother and father continue to work and spend up to four hours per day in the car, they will not see their parents. They will be looked after by their parents only at weekends and by someone else during the week. While failures of public transport are not the sole reason for adversely affecting the quality of life of this and the next generation, they are a large part of the problem. That is the reason quality of life issues will be important in the forthcoming general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to focus on five or six issues which directly affect my constituency. I express my disappointment that the budget which contains allocations for capital expenditure on rail and bus <Col N="691" /> development up to 2004 does not contain any provisions for the development of a rail link to Navan. This has been spoken about by Government politicians in County Meath in the past, but does not seem to be a priority now as far as the allocation of funds is concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the significant improvement in bus services by Bus Éireann in County Meath. This is acknowledged by my constituents and I give credit to all who deserve it. However, I regret that park and ride facilities have not been provided anywhere in County Meath or in the area surrounding Dublin. While the Government has provided tax incentives for park and ride facilties, these have not been taken up because there is no authority with the ability to buy the site upon which the park and ride facility can be provided by the private sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy in relation to road tolls is perverse. I will illustrate this by reference to my constituency. There are road tolls on the M50, the result of which is that heavy vehicle traffic does not go around the M50, which is built to accommodate it, but through towns, such as Maynooth, Dunboyne and Ratoath, to avoid paying tolls. The Government is intent on doing the same throughout the country. Tolls will be installed on the roads to Cavan and Drogheda, the effect of which will be that heavy vehicles will be diverted into small villages which are unsuitable for such traffic. If we are to have tolls, they should be on heavy vehicles in cities, not on bypasses. We are putting the tolls in the wrong place. We are putting them where they should not be, rather than where they should be in terms of sustainable traffic development.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem with the internal management of CIE. The Government should not own the public transport company. It should lay down the rules under which public transport should operate, but there is not any need for it to be the owner-manager. The industrial relations situation in CIE is in part due to the fact that its agenda is politically driven and the subject of political interference. There is always an appeal against anything decided by management to the Minister of the day, whoever that might be. This has a negative effect on the development of a public transport service.</P>
    <P>I believe very passionately in the development of public transport but I do not believe it needs to be publicly owned. Public transport should be regulated by the Government rather than owned by it if we want it to thrive and grow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>The disregard of the problems faced by the Dublin commuter is a true reflection of the ongoing inability of this Government to get it right. Today we have a city which this Administration is bringing to a standstill. The amount of time wasted by this, and the cost to both the public and private sectors, is incalculable. We have roads that are congested, a bus service that is less than that of three years ago and train links which <Col N="692" /> have become sardine cans for the travelling public.</P>
      <P>The abject abandonment of leadership as demonstrated by the Minister for Public Enterprise will guarantee her a place in the annals of political history. We are all aware of the growth in population and the resulting increased demands from commuters, yet the Minister has not succeeded in doing a single constructive thing to make an improvement to the daily quality of life of those obliged to travel to and from Dublin city.</P>
      <P>At one time the city area was measured on the basis that the suburbs lay at least one hour's travel time from the city centre. If that measure of travel time was applied today, Saint Stephen's Green would be considered the city limits. If something radical does not take place soon the Department of Foreign Affairs will seem like it is in outer Mongolia, such is the very desperate state of traffic congestion. We need radical commuter-focused action spearheaded with money to back up the policy. Otherwise the far distant solution of Luas will be a pitiful consolation for those who currently spend long periods commuting relatively short distances. Fine Gael has a bill hoarding that asks, &ldquo;Where do you spend your free time?&rdquo;  I want to tell the Government that Joe the commuter spends so much of his free time in his car that that is where he will decide for whom he will vote.</P>
      <P>Bus services that are inefficient to meet the travel needs of the public are of no great value in addressing the crisis that exists. A far greater level of investment and competition is required in the market to require car users to become bus users. In the suburbs of our cities and in large urban areas, the Government must ensure that residential developments are serviced by small local bus networks, thus providing a system that will divert workers away from reliance on cars and towards the main bus services or upgraded rail services. The delivery of Luas and Metro will be of little value unless access to railway stations is made easy and practical.</P>
      <P>Until solutions to infrastructure are devised, the Government must investigate all possible means of getting more multi-passenger vehicles into the network. There should be incentives available to employers to examine how they might contribute to the reduction of traffic congestion. I spoke here previously on the introduction of targeted alternate start and finish times in different parts of the city in order to give a better spread of demand. It is also possible to designate the traffic flow to take account of rush hour demand. Main route lines should be established similar to the bus lanes that could be used to meet the rush hour demand travelling into the city in the mornings and reversed in the evenings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that there is so little time at this stage. I say to the Deputies opposite that it would be hard to conceive of more inept handling of the Dublin traffic problem than we have seen in the past five years. Despite <Col N="693" /> eight different blueprints for what they were going to do about Dublin's traffic we still do not have Luas, nor do we have any competition on the buses, integrated ticketing, or park and ride facilities. We do not have any real time information or co-ordinated responsibility for traffic management and we do not have any increase in the number of passengers using buses.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite told us how they intended spending money, like it was going out of fashion, on solving the traffic problem. Five years on no more people are using buses, although we have given them bus lanes and priority. The Government said it would do the devil and all with new buses but we have less passengers using buses. That is total mismanagement in my view. There has been no leadership and each of these issues has been ducked.</P>
      <P>Let us address the issue of integrated ticketing. A group was set up in the Department to investigate it and yet no initiative was taken following the production of its report. Another group was set up, this time in the light rail authority office, to do the very same thing, yet we are no nearer to a resolution.</P>
      <P>Everyone accepted that a regulator should be appointed to bring competition to the bus network. The Minister said she would have legislation ready in July 2001 but she decided then to consult the unions in the bus companies as to whether we should have a regulator to open up competition. To date nothing has happened, consultation is still going on and studies are being done. We were to have a Dublin transport authority and the Minister passed that hot potato from her office to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Now we are told we will not have a Dublin transport authority; that we have to wait until there is a land use authority. I do not believe we are ever going to get the four local authorities who deal with land use to concede powers to some new unelected quango to deal with Dublin land-use planning. If we want to move on Dublin transport we have to do something about these realities.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sargent's colleague said, there is no legislation to deal with digging up the roads and the street. We have an underfunded system and it is quite clear that we are going backwards as far as getting people to switch from their car to public transport is concerned. While public transport has stagnated, the rate of car ownership has increased by 40% in four years. These are the realities and people are voting with their feet against the strategy and nothing has been done to persuade them to the contrary. Instead of taking decisions on these issues the Government is building pipedreams in the sky. It promises the Metro in 2025. This is what people have to ponder&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. The problem of traffic is escalating in Dublin at such a rate that it appears to be spiralling out of control. People living and working in the city have experienced a dramatic change in their quality of life over the past number of years. People are forced to accept sitting in traffic for endless hours as an inevitable part of their daily lives. Rather than spending time with their children or partners, individuals are compelled to waste valuable hours looking at the rear of the car in front of them. Instead of being able to unwind after a stressful day at work they must endure the tension and frustration of crawling home in traffic jams.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton said, instead of seeing improvements in the public transport system in recent times, as we would expect with this booming economy, we have seen a lack of leadership and a lack of decision making. It is extraordinary that the bus service in Dublin has been reduced by ten routes, instead of increasing routes and giving people more choice, the opportunity to travel in different directions and the kind of public transport service they need. This seriously inconveniences people and makes it very difficult for them to go about their daily lives using the public transport system. Every day, each of us in our constituencies hears stories of the routes that have been taken away and the impact that is having, particularly on the elderly.</P>
      <P>The Government prides itself on the amount of money that has been available for public spending over the past five years, so how can it justify this measure in regard to Dublin buses? It shows a disregard for improving the quality of life for the people of Dublin. As Deputy Bruton said, the Government has failed to introduce competition in this area. Dublin Bus continues to play a pivotal role in the delivery of public transport in the capital but the need to introduce competition cannot be over-stressed. Such practice is the norm in most other EU countries where transport systems are streets ahead of those here. By failing to honour its promise of three years ago, the Government has allowed the bus service to fall into even further disarray and has squandered the best opportunity we have ever had to tackle this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an absolute failure to introduce legislation to manage utilities in the city of Dublin. Why has the Government not introduced legislation to enable competent management and control over what is happening on the streets? Such legislation is long promised. Its introduction would do something to streamline the management of utilities in the interests of the people in the city and people who are suffering the effects of this day in and day out on the streets outside their homes. Every second day or every second <Col N="695" /> week, roads are dug up following which they are not properly repaired. This happens again and again. The DART service is outdated and in need of upgrading. Dublin Chamber of Commerce has recently put together a report on the matter. What are the plans to do something about this? All we have seen in this area is incompetence and people are screaming out for action. They want to be listened to. We had the resources to provide a proper public transport system over the past five years, but the Government has failed and the result has been a deterioration in the quality of life of people living in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Fine Gael motion. I have raised the issue of the short-comings of the public transport system more than any other since I entered the Dáil. Speaking in this House three years ago, I referred to the fact that Fingal rail commuters were squeezed together in carriages like sardines in a tin at peak periods and that even the toilets on trains provided standing room only. I described that train service as &ldquo;the sardine express&rdquo;. Nothing has changed in real terms for the struggling commuter, in fact, things have got infinitely worse. The recent experience at Donabate railway station witnessed by my party's leader, Deputy Quinn, and me highlighted once again the crisis in the rail network in north County Dublin serving Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock.</P>
      <P>On the morning of Monday, 21 January last, between 7.45 a.m. and 8.45 a.m. Donabate station was nothing short of a nightmare as hundreds of commuters were left stranded when one of the trains serving it did not stop as it was already full. The other trains serving the station provided standing room only by the time they reached Donabate and commuters had to squeeze on to already overcrowded trains. The peak time rail service for workers, students and other commuters in North Dublin is in crisis and deep concerns have been expressed about health and safety. On the platform that morning a young woman in the early stages of pregnancy showed us her small portable chair, purchased the previous weekend, and carried by her on all occasions on the trains. In the previous fortnight she had fainted twice on the train, while standing up. The Minister will agree that is a terrifying experience. The inadequacy of our public transport in conjunction with the gridlock on our roads is having a detrimental effect on the quality of life of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This does not even begin to reflect the implications of the Government's strategic planning guidelines for housing in the greater Dublin area which are being promoted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I am convinced we will end up with a social and planning disaster unless this Government treats as a priority the necessary improvements to our bus, <Col N="696" /> rail and road networks. With less than 90 days to the election, that is too much to expect. Perhaps it would be better for the people if the Government left the problem for a new administration to deal with. This Government and its agencies have targeted major growth areas such as Balbriggan, Lusk, Donabate, Portmarnock and Baldoyle on the northern side of Dublin on the basis that rail or DART infrastructure is in place. Builders and estate agents are selling houses on the same basis. This deliberately misleads the public. We have been informed time and time again that Iarnród Éireann will receive additional rail carriages in 2003 and that this will mean eight-carriage trains will be available by the end of that year, creating greater capacity. If these improvements would address the problems, commuters might have been willing to accept current circumstances. However, that is not the case. The core problems relating to increased capacity are infrastructural deficits between Connolly and Pearse Stations. In its document &ldquo;Platform for Change&rdquo;, Iarnród Éireann has proposed to address the issue by means of a DASH project. That programme, if completed, would double the capacity on the rail and DART network in the Dublin region. If ever a Government transport investment programme demanded priority, this is it. Notwithstanding the Government's hype about the so-called investment in public transport announced in this year's budget, the fact remains that the DASH project is being under-funded. The investment provided covers only half of the estimated cost of the project over the next three years.</P>
    <P>This Government has put rail and DART investment on the long finger and it is the long-suffering public of my constituency and others throughout the country who will have to pay the penalty. Over the past five years this Government has had available to it more money to deal with the problems of public transport than has any other in the history of the State. It has failed miserably and the public will show its contempt for that lack of action.</P>

      <P>If one views the world through the ornament on the bonnet of a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, one tends to become immune to the realities of life. Dublin is now like Seoul in terms of traffic chaos and this is causing severe disruption and will cause economic losses. People will not invest if they cannot move quickly around the city to conduct business. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, stand indicted for their abject failure to have a clear agenda as to how to solve this problem. They stand condemned before the electorate in the dying days of this Administration for that. No spatial plan or decentralisation plan has been published. These matters have been abandoned by the Government. The Government has not planned to move people <Col N="697" /> from the city to the country because of fear of what the electorate might say.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. I have written serious letters to the authority four times in the past 12 months and have not even had the courtesy of a reply. We have been blinded by figures of hundreds of millions to be spent and I hold responsible in part the planning process which grossly under estimated future traffic requirements ten years ago. Why do we have to have traffic lights on roundabouts? Coming to a roundabout on the M50, one encounters a traffic light which backs up traffic for two miles. Surely, there should be fly-overs and under-passes instead. The N5 between Strokestown and Ballaghaderreen is a glorified cart track. We are expected to put up with that on one of the main commercial arteries into Connacht, along which moves &euro;4 billion worth of goods every year, while the NRA tells us nothing will be done about it until 2015.</P>
      <P>How many elections will there have been and how many Ministers will have passed through the Department of the Environment and Local Government by then? There should be a massive investment in the rail system. People want an alternative to travel by road. I see people asleep in their cars at traffic lights. They are unable to stay awake. I see the pressure in their faces from the frustration of spending hours every week in their cars. It is having an appalling effect on families. For some people the time spend sitting in cars over a period of years, would amount to six months and the stress it causes probably shortens a person's life very considerably.</P>
      <P>The Government has not had a clear agenda here. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has been an abject failure in driving his Department to find a solution to this problem. We all know about the increase in the number of trucks on our roads, but the situation has gone from bad to worse. Like the Government, the traffic has ground to a halt. It might be as well if the Government left before it is sent off.</P>

The plan required £4 billion to be spent on public transport over the next five years: £1.5 billion on the DART and the other suburban rail lines, £1 billion on a metro system, £1 billion on Luas and £500 million on bus systems. However, as the budget has diminished, the Department of Finance is now scandalously putting a stop on these projects.</P>

    <P>The national development plan includes 750 kilometres of new motorway as against just 25 kilometres of new rail track. This is a straight matter of economics which the Government has got badly wrong because the National Roads <Col N="698" /> Authority now estimates that the real cost of its work on the roads will nearly double to £8.5 billion. In terms of value for money, the cost of resolving the huge gridlock problems will be set aside and not dealt with, and at the same time the NRA will grab every last cent it can of the moneys this Government seems prepared to allow for transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The basic message is that if the money is no longer as plentiful, we in the Green Party demand that the Government prioritise public transport improvements as this is where there has been under investment down the years.</P>
    <P>I do not just witness the chaotic overcrowding on our trains, I experience it each day I come here. I travel from north County Dublin on a line which has been unchanged since 1844. Meanwhile the road through that area has in many places been by-passed in that time. They have built by-passes of by-passes.</P>
    <P>There is a need for investment in either double-deck trains or, better still, additional track space to allow more rolling stock. There is also a need for park and ride facilities at train stations and at main towns such as the growing metropolis of Swords. We must provide work facilities and school facilities and all those necessary services close to where people live to spare them the pain of the train and the fuss of the bus which at present subjects people to unhealthy overcrowding and delays them in keeping appointments.</P>
    <P>The Government needs to provide local development plans if it is serious about tackling the transportation problems. They make sense for local economies in terms of personal sanity and health. After all, the more people are able to walk or cycle about their business, the healthier they will be, the less stressed they will be and the better it will be for all of us.</P>
    <P>Although these are strong words, ultimately what we have is a system of transportation apartheid. The National Roads Authority acts like the white people did in South Africa. They are the ones with the power and the lion's share of the money. Everybody else must take his turn and wait until the National Roads Authority is happy because that is the way the rules have been set out by the Government. What we need is an end to that apartheid and a transportation authority which will give due balance to all the good investment needed. Currently most of that investment is needed in public transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The unprecedented level of economic growth which Ireland experienced in recent years has led directly to large increases in population, in the number of households, in the numbers at work and in car ownership levels. Forecasts and projections for economic and employment growth have been exceeded year on year. The benefits of this growth and success are clear in terms of jobs and living standards. Given this growth, it is not sur<Col N="699" /> prising that capacity constraints have emerged in the transport sector.</P>
      <P>This Government has responded to these capacity constraints. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, outlined last night what has been done and what is in the pipeline, but the message bears repeating. The Government has, since it took office, prioritised the upgrading of our transport infrastructure and services in Dublin and throughout the country. It has vigorously pursued this objective through massively increased investment in the roads network and public transport. It is committed over the NDP period to maintaining transport investment programmes at a high level. The NDP provides for a total investment of more than &euro;12 billion in transport. Good progress has been made in the roll-out of the NDP transport investment programme with total investment amounting to approximately &euro;4 billion in the 2000-2002 period. The impact of this investment is evident around the country and has already been outlined in some detail by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.</P>
      <P>Improving our transport system, however, is not just about investing in more infrastructure. The Government has also undertaken, as part of an integrated approach, a range of other initiatives to complement the major investment in transport infrastructure. These include: proposals for strengthening institutional arrangements for land use and transport planning in the greater Dublin area; initiatives in relation to the regulatory and structural reform of public transport; support for the development and implementation by local authorities of better traffic management policies and practice, particularly in the Dublin area through the DTO and support for the promotion of the greater use of public transport through, for example, bus priority measures.</P>
      <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred in the debate last night to the need for the introduction of bus competition, particularly in Dublin, and Deputy Richard Bruton also raised this issue. The Government has given a great deal of attention to regulatory and structural reform of public transport. We have published two important consultation papers on these issues. The first was published in September 2000 and set out proposals for the restructuring of CIE and the liberalisation of the bus market in the greater Dublin area. Flowing from that reform programme, we have seen the establishment last month of the Railway Procurement Agency and the publication in December of the Railway Safety Bill, which provides for the establishment of an independent Railway Safety Commission. A technical study is currently under way on the restructuring of CIE. We are also engaged in consultations with the social partners through the Public Transport Partnership Forum. The forum commissioned independent research to assist in formulating a response to the Government proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultants will finish work before Easter on a review of the regulation of the bus market outside Dublin. I expect the Government will in due <Col N="700" /> course publish its report and invite a public response to its proposals for regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>The report of the three wise men on structural reform of Iarnród Éireann was published last July. It presented a challenging agenda for Irish Rail's management and unions and for the Government. All three partners accept this report as the basis for reform from within and are working to progress its implementation as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government also recognises that there is a role for private participation in the delivery of improved public transport. We see public private partnerships playing an important part in the development of infrastructure and services. The Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act provides a modern, flexible and effective legislative basis for rail PPPs. The Railway Procurement Agency has been established as a dedicated agency to procure rail PPPs. A detailed policy framework document for PPPs in the rail sector has also been prepared.</P>
    <P>More broadly, it is also important to bear in mind that meeting the transport needs of Dublin and other urban centres requires a shared responsibility and commitment to actions by all the key players including business organisations, transport authorities, councillors and individuals as well as Government. Solving our transport problems, particularly in urban areas, depends not just on actions by public authorities but on communities, business and individuals making sustainable travel choices. For example, traffic congestion in the large urban areas can be reduced by the greater use of public transport. With the major investment now taking place in public transport, the advent of quality bus corridors and the better taxi service now available, public transport is an increasingly attractive alternative to the private car.</P>
    <P>I refer to the taxis and hardship matter which was raised by Deputy Michael D. Higgins last night. The Government has decided to approve the appointment of a panel of three independent persons to report on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship which may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders as a direct result of the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry in November 2000. Persons who held a taxi licence at 21 November 2000 and consider they have suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation are invited to make submissions to the panel. It will be a matter for those making submissions to indicate how they can substantiate their claim of hardship. A two month period for submissions is being allowed following which the panel will report on the nature and extent of hardship. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal will then report back to Government on its findings.</P>
    <P>Road works are often blamed for the disruption of traffic flow on our streets and roads to which Deputy John Bruton and others referred. The issue is being addressed by the Government. <Col N="701" /> Powers to control road works by utilities are available under existing legislation, particularly the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and are being used by urban road authorities to regulate the opening of roads by utilities. The Communications Regulations Bill, currently with the Department of Public Enterprise, proposes to modernise legislation on road openings by telecommunications operators. It aims to ensure the regulatory framework which will apply to such operators will afford appropriate and updated powers to roads authorities and regulate road openings in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is also considering a wider legislative updating to deal with this important issue. A utility and statutory body working group, chaired by the DTO, has been established with the aim of standardising the approach to road works through agreed codes of practice. It comprises representatives from various bodies and agencies currently involved in telecommunications network roll-out, including the ODTR, DTO, the Departments of Public Enterprise and the Environment and Local Government, urban and rural local authorities, IBEC and Eircom. It is clear that efforts are being made to address the issue.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the need for park and ride facilities. As is clear from the DTI update strategy, it is proposed that such facilities will integrate the car with public transport. There will be park and ride facilities for commuters at strategic locations where the national road network meets the public transport networks. However, it will be essential to assess all proposed park and ride sites to ensure cars accessing them do not add to congestion. Over 2,000 additional park and ride spaces have already been provided at suburban rail stations under the DTI strategy.</P>
    <P>Park and ride tax incentives are provided for in the Finance Acts of 1999 and 2001. A person wishing to avail of the capital allowances and reliefs available must make a formal application in writing to the relevant local authority. If the local authority is satisfied that the park and ride facility and associated development, where relevant, conforms with the guidelines and legislation, it may issue a certificate which will enable the developer to avail of the tax incentives. Deputies will be interested to note that the Finance Bill, 2002, provides for an extension of tax incentives until 2004.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 significant progress has been made on the alleviation of traffic congestion in Dublin. Over 400 new buses have been purchased under the NDP. The quality bus corridor &ndash; QBC &ndash; network was substantially extended in 2001 with five new routes serving Blanchardstown, Swords, Tallaght, north Clondalkin and Rathfarnham initiated. The Malahide Road QBC was also extended. Nine QBCs are now in place and work is continuing on further routes. Dedicated cycle-ways are now a familiar sight on Dublin streets and taxi numbers have increased significantly. <Col N="702" /> Improvements have also been made to rail services, including platform lengthening, provision of additional DART and rail cars, extension of the DART to Greystones and Malahide and the completion of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line. Work is also continuing on the Luas and on 16 January the Government gave the go-ahead for a procurement process for a metro in Dublin. It is clear that significant progress is being made.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to public-private partnerships &ndash; PPPs &ndash; which will play an important role in the acceleration and delivery of road infrastructure by harnessing the skills and finance necessary to bring economies and innovation to Irish road design. They will help to build roads on time and to a high standard without eroding necessary Government investment in other essential services. The national roads investment programme, outlined in the NDP, provides for &euro;1.27 billion of private finance through PPPs, which represents 23% of total road investment. This will make possible the most ambitious road programme in the history of the State. The NRA is progressing a number of high quality schemes which are suitable as PPPs. Significant progress has been achieved in the roads PPP programme during 2001. Construction commenced on the second West Link bridge on the M50 in August 2001. Preferred bidders are due to be selected for the M25 Waterford bypass and the M4 Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway this year.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to sustained and co-ordinated action to upgrade our transport infrastructure and services, not just in Dublin and other urban centres, but throughout the country. The task is not easy and will take time, but we have a clear vision of what needs to be done and put in place the policies and funding to achieve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I wish to share time with Deputies Donal Carey, Caoimghín Ó Caoláin and Olivia Mitchell. The Government will be five years in office when the general election takes place. What a legacy it has left, what an abysmal record it has had and what a failure it has been. The Minister has set out a range of aspirations, plans and position papers and spelled out the many million euro they will cost. If he was on the Sligo train this week, he would have had no heating and sat in darkness for over four hours. This is the era of the Celtic tiger; our so-called First World economy. We have the most tatty, decrepit and run-down rail system in western Europe. It is not simply the case of the Sligo train, matters are exactly the same on the Westport train which I use when possible. I would love to use it more, but one simply cannot rely on it. I invite the Minister to view, at first hand, Heuston Station on a Thursday or Friday evening. It is something to behold. Passengers have to queue and when the white flag is raised and the whistle blown, there is a stampede. The reason is there is never enough space on the train. Passengers stand in the aisles, between the carriages and on top of <Col N="703" /> each other. In many cases they are elderly, returning from surgery or hip replacement operations in Dublin. There is no trolley service whatsoever. It is small wonder that matters are as they are. We have a rail system that is driven by locomotives from the 1970s and carriages from the 1960s.</P>
      <P>When the Government assumed office it inherited a ready to roll Luas system. Designs were in place, most of the planning had been completed and EU funding secured. At exactly the same time, the French city of Montpellier had the same system at the same stage. It has now been running for two years. All we have had are potholes, crevices, traffic jams, a charade in Merrion Square, lots of front page advertising in the national newspapers and now we are told we are to have an experimental 300 yard track at the Red Cow roundabout.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned integrated ticketing, which does not take a lot of planning as it is an administrative issue. Integrating tickets would allow one to travel by bus and rail with one ticket. The parent company is CIE, the subsidiary companies are Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann, yet it has not been possible to produce a simple ticket that would allow one to transfer from one system to another. The Minister talked about the often promised park and ride facilities and of the danger of causing congestion where cars would converge at particular locations. After five years in office, a simple co-ordinated scheme, integrating the car with the bus and rail systems, has not been introduced. I welcome the QBCs, but they have been a limited success and far too few.</P>
      <P>We have the most chaotic capital city in Europe, a city choking to death. It is a nightmare, a place where, as Deputy Kenny said, people have to spend up to four hours per day looking at the back window of the car in front of them. It is the most unsociable city in the world from the perspective of work and family life.</P>
      <P>I am delighted Deputy Olivia Mitchell has tabled this motion. She has single-handedly pioneered and championed this issue. I have no doubt that she will make a superb Minister for Public Enterprise in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in appealing to the Taoiseach and his Ministers to speak strongly to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who has made a complete mess of his portfolio. The speakers to the motion have illustrated this clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister present spoke about capacity constraints and the Government's response. That is the core of the issue. For example, we have a severe traffic problem in Clare. I live in Clarecastle which has been decimated by traffic. We are concerned about our future. Despite this, the Minister and the National Roads Authority have postponed the Ennis bypass. All the preparations have been done by Clare County Council, includ<Col N="704" /> ing arrangements for compulsory purchase and completion of notices to treat and entry. The only delay was the IFA dispute, which has been settled. There is no reason compulsory purchase of the land could not proceed this year. Instead, the NRA has instructed the council to postpone the matter. A recent delegation from the council to the NRA was told that the board of the authority cannot make a decision because it only has eight members whereas it should by statute have 14 members. The delegation was also told that the new members, when appointed, would have to read into the briefs before a decision could be made. That is hardly efficiency and it will not impress the Americans trying to establish an industry in my constituency or the businesses located in the industrial estate in Shannon who find their employees are continually delayed by traffic jams in Clarecastle, Newmarket-on-Fergus and Shannon.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Smith, is well aware of the problems of the mid-west. He referred in his speech to public private partnerships and the effect they will have. There is a campaign in his constituency against toll roads and PPPs. Will we in Clare be left with toll roads and PPPs while people in Dublin and the east enjoy the best of new roads? If such a difficulty existed in County Meath, I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, would not be long in eradicating it. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Smith, to point out to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that he has the power to tell the NRA to proceed with the Ennis bypass, as indicated to Clare County Council, which it is estimated will cost &euro;115 million. I do not understand what is delaying this development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Jim Higgins and his colleagues for sharing their time. The transport and traffic gridlock in Dublin, on the national roads and in main towns is one of the most obvious and visible signs of the Government's failure to take the bold and definitive decisions needed to address serious social and economic problems. As in the areas of health and housing, the Government has squandered the golden opportunities offered by economic prosperity to reform, renew and resource the transport system properly. We do not have an integrated transport system. We have a complex of competing elements which amount to chaos.</P>
      <P>In the region I represent, public transport, apart from expressway services through the towns of Cavan and Monaghan and the clapped-out school bus service, is non-existent. In comparison, Dublin has a myriad of public transport services, but in this city the Government has also failed abjectly to provide the public transport essential to ending the dependence on private cars which causes gridlock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore the continuing failure of the Government and the National Roads Authority, despite all the talk of peace dividends and cross-Border co-operation, to prioritise the N2 national route <Col N="705" /> between Dublin and Derry. Bypasses at Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and Monaghan are behind schedule and traffic is still being forced through the death trap that is Slane village with no indicators of a prospect of a bypass in the short to medium term. This is a disgrace. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>As this will probably be the last Private Members' debate on traffic in this Dáil, it is with sadness that I look back on the five years of economic expansion and growth, when people worked hard and had expectations, and see how little was delivered by the Government. It is not just that but also that the transport deficit has grown by so much in that time. Now, when the cupboard is bare, there is much more to be done and it will be much more costly and disruptive. It will also be imposed on a city that is almost at gridlock.</P>
      <P>The self-congratulatory tone of the Government amendment to the motion makes one wonder if the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who spoke last night, or any member of the Government lives in the same world as the rest of us. Do they travel the same streets we do, suffer the same levels of stress and breathe the same toxic fumes? Have their commuting times doubled, as they have for the rest of us? Do they suffer the same frustrating, nail-biting and hair-pulling tension every time they must make even the smallest journey, even within their local areas? Are they all too long in Government and living in such a rarefied atmosphere of power at a remove from the public that they can no longer empathise with the everyday concerns of the people they purport to represent?</P>
      <P>If they can, and I am sure there must be some Members on the Government side who empathise with ordinary men who must get to work every morning and ordinary women who must bring their children to crèches and then go to work, do they recognise that they are the only people who can do anything about the real misery suffered by every inhabitant of the greater Dublin region? How can any Minister congratulate himself and the Government if he has any idea of the reality of congestion with which people in this city must live every day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister present read the newspaper this morning, he would have seen that RTE is to <Col N="706" /> broadcast the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; radio programme at an earlier time to reflect the fact that the majority of the population is on the streets, either in cars or waiting at bus stops, listening to their radios a half hour earlier than they were last year or the year before. Many of them will have already brought their children to crèches or child minders before they begin their own frustrating and tedious journey to work. People's mornings are getting earlier and their evenings are getting later. They now have a 12 hour working day. This has happened in the past five years and is a poor quality of life. There is no such thing as arriving home at 5.30 p.m. to put the children to bed. It is a case of waking them up when one arrives home at 8 p.m. That is certainly the case for my constituents.</P>
    <P>The Government has never taken the traffic problem in Dublin seriously and, consequently, never had any sense of urgency about it. When I tabled the first Private Members' motion on this subject four and a half years ago and tried to communicate the disaster looming then which was obvious to anyone who looked around and saw what was happening, I was dismissed by Government backbenchers and told I was exaggerating and scaremongering. We have lost competitiveness and jobs due to congestion, and we have certainly lost quality of life, free time and faith in the Government to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I spoke last night about rail developments, buses and everything else the Government promised and did not deliver. Its record is a litany of promises on which it has failed to deliver. Quality bus corridors are an example. They are wonderful and I support them but where is the capacity increase and frequency of buses needed? It does not exist. To feed the few QBCs which work, Dublin Bus has had to take buses from other routes. Some routes have been closed and there are now ten less routes in operation than there were five years ago, despite the huge expansion in population.</P>
    <P>I could go on, but I have rehearsed all these problems so often that I realise the Government has no intention of giving us anything but more promises. It has wasted the last five golden years of opportunity and will not get such an opportunity again. It is time for it to get out of office and let someone else deliver.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes the Minister for Finance has initiated in the Bill with regard to the town renewal scheme. The town renewal scheme was initiated in July 1999 to benefit all small towns. There are around 100 towns benefiting from the town renewal scheme. At the time of the inception of the scheme and when the towns were designated in July 2002, a number of designations were given to different properties. It was a very <Col N="709" /> complicated system and different types of designations were given to different types of buildings. In the wisdom of the Government, it was announced, under section 23, that there would be a <i>carte blanche</i> across all the properties in respect of the town renewal schemes. I am delighted that both Charlton and Kanturk in my constituency are benefiting from the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues relating to town renewal that must be highlighted. There seems to be some divergence between what was actually designated and why designations were made. From the criteria that were laid down, sometimes it is very hard to say why some properties were left out, but that is not for discussion in respect of the Finance Bill. What should be discussed is section 23, initiated by the Minister. I welcome wholeheartedly the idea in the section. It is a brilliant concept, namely the generation of more activity within rural towns and villages. There is no doubt that small rural towns suffered from major depopulation, particularly their centres, over the past number of years. We hope this Bill will address this in a major way.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have seen a massive reduction in the burden of taxation. Direct taxation or income tax has been reduced enormously, which I welcome. Fifteen or 20 years ago it was said that it did not pay to work, that one was giving 50, 60 or 70 pence in the pound back to the taxman and that there was no incentive to work. When people take home their pay packets and see the reduction in taxation, I know they will still say they do not want to pay any tax. However, they all understand the reason why they are paying it.</P>
    <P>The reduction in taxation has produced a greater incentive for people to work, which is one of the greatest things in any society. For far too long there was a perception that it did not pay to work. I am delighted that perception no longer exists. The only sure way of reducing the level of poverty is to ensure that people have jobs. In the past few years, we have seen almost 400,000 jobs being created. While we see major job announcements and major companies employing 1,400 and 1,600 people, they tend to be located close to large centres of population, though that is not always true. The amount of jobs created throughout the country has certainly lifted the rural economy as well as the major centres of population. Not too far from my home place on the border of counties Cork and Kerry, there are 1,600 employed in Munster Joinery who are travelling the country. They are manufacturing windows. Munster Joinery is located in a very rural setting and is providing enormous employment for east Kerry, parts of west County Limerick and the western side of County Cork.</P>
    <P>Investment in schools should be considered. We have put an enormous amount of money into schools over the past 4 and a half years, but we need more. For far too long primary schools in particular were neglected, and they have to be brought up to full standard. If we are serious about ensuring the success of this Celtic tiger <Col N="710" /> economy and creating further wealth, there is no doubt that investment in our education system is one of the most important things we can do. We have a great education system, but for a number of years there was very little investment in the basic infrastructure. Money should be continually pumped into the system by way of the capital programme to ensure the system remains good.</P>
    <P>There are some measures in the Bill concerning nursing homes and giving greater tax breaks. There are also incentives to facilitate and encourage carers looking after elderly relatives at home. Public representatives of all parties have seen the massive demand that exists for long-term care beds for the elderly and the growth of nursing homes in recent years. People approach us and say that because they are over the limit for the means test or because of some technicality they are finding difficulty in getting the carer's allowance. The means test limit for the carer's allowance and the carer's benefit have been increased in recent years. These measures are ensuring the elderly can remain in their own environment for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>In 1997, the home help allowance was £1.40 per hour; it is now over £7. Home help is now seen as a respectable job, ensuring that people can stay within their own environment for as long as possible. I encourage the Government, as far as is possible, to ensure that this is continued. With regard to the care of the elderly and the provisions in the Finance Bill and in past budgets, particularly the last budget, if we are serious about making it attractive for people to be cared for in their own homes, the carer's allowance and such things have to be encouraged more and more. In some instances, they have proved to be very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I know the Government is looking seriously at the possibility of public private partnerships in respect of State buildings such as schools and hospitals. We can see the vast amount of money projects by Departments, the Office of Public Works and others cost. If the private sector were involved, we might be able to build far more cheaply than we are at the moment. There should be an overall study done of these projects and something built into the system that would ensure the private sector took on such projects and rented them back to the public sector.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme has been increased from &euro;317,500 to &euro;750,000, which is to be welcomed. The scheme has been of benefit to Charleville in my constituency. A number of years ago the chamber of commerce with other interested groups used the scheme to build an advance factory in the town which would not have been built were it not for the tax incentives available through the BES.</P>
    <P>The taxation initiative for sports people was mentioned. I am pleased at the amount of money spent on local sports facilities during the years, but more should be spent on these projects. If we are serious about alternatives to crime, drugs, etc. <Col N="711" /> no area of the country should be without proper sports facilities, an area in which I encourage the Government to continue to invest. I would like to see a tax incentive for businesses or individuals to invest in local sports clubs and organisations and call on the Minister to investigate this, as it would be of benefit to our youth.</P>
    <P>In recent months there has been a debate led by An Taisce about once-off houses in rural Ireland, a matter which has been discussed on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and elsewhere. As a rural Deputy, I find it crazy that anybody would try to prevent development in rural areas. I know that planning is required and that monstrosities or skyscrapers should not be built on the rural landscape, but once-off houses are of enormous benefit to such areas. Governments have spent millions on rural development ensuring the rural population survives. We have had debates about the future of An Post, shops, villages and rural schools for many years. In the past there was population decline, but now that people are queuing up to build homes in rural Ireland, they cannot do so because it is deemed detrimental to the landscape.</P>
    <P>No planning would be required to plant 60 hectares of sitka spruce trees anywhere in rural Ireland, even though this might be detrimental to the landscape. However, the building of an ordinary bungalow could be stopped. On any road or boreen it is much nicer to see a house with a couple of cars outside and children giving some life to the area than a blanket of trees. I know the vast majority of public representatives from rural areas agree with this. To ensure we have a vibrant rural community, this issue needs to be resolved. I accept the need for rules and regulations, but they must be sensible.</P>
    <P>This is the last Finance Bill of the 28th Dáil and I am delighted to have been here to see all the major changes that have occurred in the past five years. I know much more remains to be done, but I compliment the Minister and the Government on all their work, which has benefited the country. Even in the short time that I have been a public representative, since 1997, I have seen tremendous developments for the elderly, home helps, etc. I know there are other issues to be addressed, but the day there are no issues will be the one that politics and politicians become defunct. I am delighted to have been able to contribute to all the Finance Bills mentioned and thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Daly. Deputy Moynihan made the very valid point that we are now dealing with the final Finance Bill of the 28th Dáil. What an extraordinary collection of Finance Bills we have had. By any objective standards, Deputy McCreevy has undoubtedly been one of the most progressive, innovative and radical Ministers of Finance in the history of the State. I did not agree with him <Col N="712" /> about some of the things that have been done, but there have been remarkable achievements. The whole process of changing the tax year in line with the calendar year, which is so logical, has not been referred to in the debate so far. The tenure of the Minister has been an extraordinarily creative period. He has been very well served by the staff of the Department. As a former employee, I always believed the Department had many qualities, but those qualities could only be brought out by the leadership of a truly innovative Minister.</P>
      <P>The record is there to be seen and enjoyed by everybody in the country. The Minister has given us unparalleled tax equity. The personal income tax changes have been quite remarkable. Before the Government came to office, for a whole variety of reasons, the tax burden on the single person was extraordinary. Everybody with an income above &euro;17,270 paid tax at the higher rate. Following budget 2002, the same person will not pay tax on the higher rate until his or her income exceeds &euro;28,000. That is a marvellous achievement, which all previous Ministers for Finance would love to have achieved.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill expands the tax bands. A further 57,000 low-income earners have been removed from the tax net. That is something we should celebrate. We have introduced the tax credit system. Some years ago as a student we talked about the acme of achievement that should be striven for. It has been introduced and is operational which is entirely due to the Minister. Since 1997 the positive changes have removed 71,500 elderly people from the tax net. Like most fair-minded Members, I always regarded it as being almost obscene that pensioners had to pay tax, but that has now changed.</P>
      <P>There are a number of more radical measures. It is well known in the House that I am not a sportsperson, but I have been stunned and surprised by the curmudgeonly begrudging attitude to the tax relief for such persons. A number of years ago a former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charles Haughey, introduced a tax concession for artists and writers. At the time the same type of criticism was made, but within a year it was regarded as progressive. Over the past ten years it has been regarded as one of the most progressive measures ever introduced. This veritably modest proposal has attracted a negative response that it did not deserve.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Moynihan, I welcome another change the Minister made, namely the dramatic increase in medical expense relief and relief for the employment of carers, which is progressive.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers talked about the urban renewal scheme, which has been innovative. The rural renewal scheme which followed on from it has also been innovative. In the case of the rural scheme, there has been some degree of flexibility, possibly due to the challenges posed by the definition in terms of what comes under it. I am sure Members on all sides of the House would agree that some additional review is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" />Sections 33 and 39 are extraordinarily progressive. Section 33, which amends section 843 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, deals with the issue of capital expenditure incurred for certain educational buildings. That is a progressive measure. It is reflected in section 39. The provision of tax relief for donations to sports bodies for the funding of capital projects is marvellous. Over the years sports clubs, be they the GAA, rugby, tennis or some other sport, have done remarkable work. They have got some support from the lottery. It is time we introduced this progressive measure to allow for tax write offs for donations made to clubs for capital purposes. It is a progressive move by the Minister and I believe Members on all sides of the House welcome it.</P>
    <P>I have been seeking taxation relief on shipping tonnage for longer than I care to recall. Deputy Daly, who was the first Minister for the Marine, is present and I know he would have shared that aspiration when he held that office. This is a most important provision. It is astonishing that we are almost the last EU member state to introduce it. In the past we disadvantaged our few shipping fleets. I am delighted this has come true. I lobbied the Minister on this issue, particularly having regard to the needs of a remarkable private company, Arklow Shipping, in my constituency. This progressive measure is a celebration of the success of companies such as that.</P>
    <P>After the Minister introduced the budget, I raised a concern about the tax ceiling introduced for renovations to heritage buildings. I discussed the matter with the Minister since and he agreed that an amendment would be included in the Finance Bill covering trusts which formed to deal with heritage buildings. The Minister indicated that the provision is in the Bill, and I hope he will confirm it is the type of measure I sought. In the budget the Minister introduced a tax ceiling of £25,000 in this context. A major project, the renovation of Christ Church, is under way in Bray. It is an important project and the work is only possible due to preferential treatment introduced under the Taxes Consolidation Act some years back. The capping introduced in the budget was to prevent abuse, but providing for a relaxation of that measure to allow the previous regime to continue would be beneficial in this case. I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>This is good Finance Bill. Many previous Ministers would have wished to have been of the position the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. He has made his luck in this regard and we should compliment him. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Roche for affording me the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Like Deputy Roche, I compliment the Minister for Finance and his Department on their outstanding performance and achievement over the past few years. This Bill consolidates the major beneficial financial advances that have been made over the past four or five years. In regard to the fairly dramatic and innovative changes that <Col N="714" /> have taken place, the Minister will rank as one of the most innovative and forward looking Ministers for Finance since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The personal taxation measures alone provided in this Bill and recent Finance Acts have been particularly helpful, especially in providing relief for many elderly people and taking others out of the tax net. More than 70,000 elderly have been taken out of the tax net since 1997, which is a major achievement. That has been coupled with reductions in the level of taxation in recent years. On one issue alone, the reduction in taxation and the taking of many low paid and elderly people out of the tax net, there is reason to endorse this Bill and compliment the Minister on the work he has done in that area.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 16, which effectively will bring investors back into the housing market. Fianna Fáil policy since its foundation has been geared towards advancing the construction industry &ndash; the party has been synonymous with the building industry. It gave the industry life and vibrancy. Every time Fianna Fáil went out of office the building industry went into decline because people involved in the industry did not have confidence to invest and develop it. Confidence in the building industry is one of the main barometers of economic performance and development in any economy. This section alone will make a major contribution towards restoring confidence in the construction industry, in investors in the industry and in the housing market.</P>
      <P>Section 29 provides relief for the purchase of milk quota. Many small farmers, certainly many in my constituency, have been put to the pin on their collar to raise finances to purchase milk quota, which is important for the small farmer surviving on milk production and on which many small farmers, including many in west Clare, to a large extent depend. This relief is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been innovative in introducing concessions for the building of private hospitals in recent years. Section 31 provides further relief and introduces new measures to encourage investment in private hospitals. The Minister introduced provisions in recent years which encouraged private individuals to provide accommodation for elderly people in private nursing homes. A number of private nursing homes which were recently constructed were completed just prior to the introduction of the scheme. These people have a genuine grievance and I would like the Minister to examine the possibility of extending the relief to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the urban renewal scheme, which is beginning to be successful. I am glad that certain extensions to it have been granted because even in the case of the initial urban renewal scheme it was some time before people began to get involved. I recall that when Ennis was first designated it took almost two years before the scheme got under way. Some of the small towns designated under the scheme, those in County Clare in particular, were <Col N="715" /> slow on the uptake. This extension is badly required to encourage people to invest in the renewal of towns and villages, particularly in the west.</P>
    <P>That scheme, to a large extent, has not been as successful as anticipated. However, the extensions and exemptions granted in the Finance Bill will encourage people in small towns to invest in the renewal of these towns. It will make a major contribution to keeping people out of the larger centres of population and help to stabilise the population, particularly in western counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a major contribution to the economic prosperity of this country in the policies he has followed since he took office. I am sure the foundations which are laid and consolidated in the Bill before the House will form the basis of a sound policy for the next four or five years. We hope we will be here to see that through as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Perry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to discover Deputy Roche was in the Department of Finance. That explains why the Department was in such disarray for about 20 years. I can now understand why the Department could not achieve a surplus. The same Deputy Roche had a great relationship with the then Minister, Dr. Martin O'Donoghue, and the country never recovered after his term in office. I can understand why the Department has not recovered either.</P>
      <P>The people of my constituency regularly ask me where the money has gone. It is a good question. I listened to the previous speakers talking about our wonderful Minister and Government. This country had a surplus in recent years but the situation is now reversing. We have problems. If there is so much money in the country why are children being taken out of schools, why are people on hospital waiting lists, why can people not get their relatives into nursing homes and why are so many people dissatisfied?</P>
      <P>I will start with the provision of tax relief for sportspersons. It is outrageous, particularly when one thinks of the people living on social welfare. Some of these sportspeople moan and groan about this State. They give out about the facilities, the Government and the country generally. If one asked the same people to open a supermarket or shop, they would not do it for less than £5,000. Now we are going to give them tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hear a great deal about the Niall Quinns and Roy Keanes who live outside the State. I also listen to Eamon Dunphy and John Giles, who at least live in this country. I take this opportunity to compliment and congratulate Niall Quinn. I wish there were more people like him. He is due to have a testimonial match in the next few weeks <Col N="716" /> and will donate the proceeds to charity, one in Ireland and one in England. Well done, Niall Quinn. I would not mind helping him.</P>
    <P>Look at the type of money some of these people are earning from sports. Just because they are friends of the Government and the Minister for Finance, a tax break is being introduced in this Bill to look after them. The same Department has no money for schools, hospitals or the woman on whose behalf I had to beg last week to get her into Beaumont Hospital. Is that not a two tier system?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is busy on the roads at the moment. There is nothing but helicopters and airplanes flying in and out of Mayo&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>To Knock Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish they would come by road. I am anxious to talk about the N5 and the Minister has given me the cue. They never come by road, always by air. I am glad you mentioned Knock Airport, Minister, because I want to ask you to do something for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to intervene but if the Deputy addressed his remarks through the Chair he might not invite interruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that. I want the Minister to do something for Knock Airport, now that he has mentioned it. We are seeking a special tax designation for Knock Airport. The airport has been let down when it should have been supported by all Governments. It is a necessary element of infrastructure in the west and it needs some tax designation. I call on the Minister of State and the Government to introduce that immediately so the airport can get moving again by generating employment and attracting industry.</P>
      <P>The west is disadvantaged. The Minister is aware of the problem with the roads. IBEC recently visited the Minister's Department&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great road to Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity to speak shortly. IBEC was complaining on behalf of the few companies located in the west which are losing a fortune because their customers are complaining that their products are damaged. This is because the roads cannot take the lorries which bring the products from Westport, Castlebar or Ballina. I call on the Minister, as a west of Ireland Deputy, to talk to his senior colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to direct the NRA to put the necessary funding and commitment into this. The Government has the power under the Act to direct the NRA to make that road a priority. We are entitled to have at least one decent national primary road into the west. I challenge the Minister and the Govern<Col N="717" /> ment to look after both Knock Airport and the N5, two necessary elements of infrastructure in the west.</P>
      <P>I do not know why sportspeople deserve a tax break. Why was a tax break not given to the shareholders and workers of Eircom? The workers were bought off with shares. They were told they would have the shares for the rest of their lives. They were given a guarantee by the Government and the Minister, in a £90 million PR campaign, that everything would be well. Why did the Minister not compensate these people, particularly the poor people who wanted and needed help and who believed the Government? They will be waiting in the long grass for the Government.</P>
      <P>There is one thing one cannot do. Fianna Fáil will promise the sun, moon and stars &ndash; there was a time it would promise the bees but would not give the honey. However, when one takes a pound out of a person's pocket, they will not forget it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government took it through the Eircom shares and it will pay for it.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss another issue that is close to my heart with regard to tax designation. In the past fortnight we heard a wonderful announcement from Europe, that we would be able to buy cheaper cars. Ministers and my own colleagues, great Europeans, wonder why the people rejected the Nice referendum. I can give one of the reasons for rejecting it. We joined what was then the EEC and is now the European Union, and we are now talking about enlargement. The Government would be better off if it returned the VRT to the people rather than giving the money to overpaid sportspeople. VRT should be removed from cars. If that change was introduced in this Bill, I would welcome it and congratulate the Minister on doing a wonderful job.</P>
      <P>The Government wants us to be wonderful Europeans and citizens but if I go to Belgium, England or France to buy a car, when I bring it to this country the guy with the peaked cap will insist that I pay the Government up to £8,000. Is that equality in Europe? Why was that not dealt with in the Finance Bill? No, the Minister had to look after the guys with the hats, the horseracing people.</P>
      <P>If there is one group of people who are thankful to the Minister, it is the bookies. They are friends of the Government &ndash; it is no wonder they have the Government installed as favourites to win the election. How could we get fair play with the Government buying them off, giving them tax relief and putting more money into their pockets? The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were looking up the odds last week. Did they think Paddy Power was going to say that Fine Gael would win the election or that Independent Newspapers would say it? Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another subject dear to my heart, which was touched on by previous speakers, is the plight of <Col N="718" /> carers, home helps. Once, they received £1 per hour which was raised to £1.20. Then health boards had to pay the minimum wage, which is what home helps now get. It is difficult to get people to do this hard job for only two or three days a week. Now they are taxed. In recognition of the job they do, in the Bill we should have decided not to tax them for a 40 hour week, which would be an incentive for people to do this work. The Government gives with one hand and takes with the other. This is the caring Government which looked after the bookies, the rich and the chief executives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about old age pensioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister of State when he spoke. It took three years to establish the urban renewal scheme, about which many have spoken, but no one is taking it up because the tax breaks are not attractive. The Government has been a good employer to the media, consultants and spin doctors. It was money well spent because announcements made four years ago are being respun and reissued. They get media coverage because many of the Government's consultants were employed at RTE and the Independent Group of Newspapers where they use their connections. While it is not cheap, it is a new industry on which taxpayer's money is spent.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was prominent in the media morning, noon and night. I was sick of hearing his name over the Christmas period. He had to announce the increase in social welfare. Who asked him to do so? Everyone already knew about it. The advertising was not cheap as it was carried in the local and national papers and on local and national radio. Like me, the Minister should not be photographed too often as he is going thin on top.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister benefit the whole of the west by doing something about planning permission? If we do not act soon, there will be land banks and reservations in the west with no one living on them. There is a hidden agenda. The various State agencies state no houses can be built because areas are protected or preserved while county councils deny planning permission. A family member who wants to build must be protected from this. We fought the landlords for our independence and freedom, but now there is a new landlord, the State, which is not protecting young couples. In Mayo County Council there is an average of 50 planning applications refused about which we know. Others are withdrawn on the advice of the planning officer while some are referred to An Bórd Pleanála. Ministers announced the CLÁR programme, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cúiv, but his £20 million would not cover four roads in my constituency. He held public meetings with his spin doctors and the Saw Doctors to publicise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that there is so little time as there are other matters I want to discuss. The <Col N="719" /> Government should do something about Knock Airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy's party sorted that out when in government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>We did, but it could not be taken up at the time. I ask the Government to extend it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche spoke of Charles Haughey who, as Taoiseach, introduced tax breaks for artists, which I welcomed. However, artists cannot be compared to sportsmen today. Many artists could not make a living and their work was only valuable after their deaths. The present day sportsperson gets well paid.</P>
      <P>I do not welcome the Bill. The Government had the best opportunity to tackle inequality, look after the sick and poor, and provide for schools, but let us down. I have bad news for it because the Independent Newspapers opinion polls are wrong. I meet the ordinary punters every day and they will deal with the Government. I assure the Minister that if we all get back, which is the most important matter&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am delighted to follow Deputy Ring as he aptly identified many issues. I call the proposals for sportsmen the Charlie's Angels Bill. From where did the Minister get the idea? The notion of favouring the well heeled by giving millionaire sportsmen a ten year tax rebate is one of his mysteries. I agree with Deputy Ring on this. The GAA and other amateur sportspersons have contributed to the development of sport. Who were the main movers behind this proposal? There are 1,300 applications for capital grants for sports projects and while many are hopeful of receiving funding, having met the Minister and officials, the record shows that only a handful will.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed in many areas. The indications in his speech are not good. The next Government, which I hope will be led by Fine Gael, will have difficult times as there will be a deficit of &euro;4 billion. Over the last five years, when we had a surplus, huge amounts were squandered. No other measure highlights the Government's skewed priorities in favouring the rich at everyone else's expense as the sportsperson proposal.</P>
      <P>On radio this evening, the principal of Riverstown school spoke of the Third World conditions in his school of 97 children built in 1904. It is wrong that in these times a principal must beg to have his school upgraded. It is featured throughout the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential road infrastructure in the national development plan is not being delivered. <Col N="720" /> I see massive signs in Sligo referring to NDP funding. The Minister of State will be able to see them when he comes to Sligo &ndash; but nothing is happening. The signs are erected and that is all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has not been in Sligo recently. This will be a major election issue and Fianna Fáil will be in serious trouble in Sligo. There are big signs up about the inner relief road but the word on the ground at present is that there is no money and the National Roads Authority chief executive has not said the money is available. Some of the election candidates in the area are politicising the issue but it should not be politicised.</P>
      <P>The Minister should say with no ambiguity that there is &euro;20 million available for this job. When I put down a parliamentary question on this issue yesterday his answer was that he was not responsible to the House on the issue as it was a matter for the National Roads Authority. I am putting down a marker here. This is a big issue, as it is one of the biggest developments in Sligo and has been fought for 20 years. Is the funding in place for this road? As we speak, the Minister is kicking to touch and the NRA is kicking to touch. That cannot continue.</P>
      <P>The Castlebaldwin by-pass is another issue being kicked to touch. People are intelligent and will not be fobbed off with promises on this matter. This will be an election issue that will cost the Government dearly if there is no clarity on it. I have a commitment from Deputy Noonan that in Government there will be no difficulty with either the inner relief road or the Castlebaldwin by-pass.</P>
      <P>Last week Mr. Ray MacSharry said in Sligo that one of his major regrets was that this road did not proceed.</P>

      <P>I agree entirely, but we are now in a different era. The people of Sligo need clarity as to when this road will be built.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Commission must also be addressed. As Deputy Ring said, I heard the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, announce the CLÁR programme on the radio during the week. It is the biggest snow job of all time &ndash; there is no money. He said if communities have a problem and have a shortfall he will make it up &ndash; it is like &ldquo;live horse and get grass&rdquo;. People have asked me what this is about &ndash; there are no applications needed but if one sends an application in, one is looked after. I never saw such politics in all my life. There is &euro;20 million in funding but no applications are needed; people are to call in to be looked after. It is a political slush fund but it will not be spent before the election.</P>

People are not taking that in this day and age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pro-sport but sport starts at ground level. There are approximately 80 applications from Sligo on the desk of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. He vetted some and told the applicants what to do but they will not get any money. He should tell them that. Perhaps five or six or them will get money. In the last three years Sligo-Leitrim applicants sought £17 million; how much was granted? Just £1.5 million in the past three years. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>Radiotherapy is needed in Sligo General Hospital. What is happening? People must spend three hours on an unheated train to a Dublin hospital, where they face further delays &ndash; they may have to book into a bed and breakfast or even come back the next day. Patients from the west are not wanted in Dublin hospitals because they are a major inconvenience to the administration of those hospitals. Why can we not have radiotherapy in Sligo General Hospital? It is because of money. The priorities are totally skewed. The boom has gone and so has the money but people expect more.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Michael Farrell of Connacht Gold, who has been appointed chief executive of the Western Development Commission and do not doubt he will do an exceedingly good job. However, I hope he is given more support than was Sean Tighe, the outgoing chair. He had no money and was totally frustrated in his job. Deputy Ó Cuív said he would do things his way; that he would not pledge money but would see how things were going. That is not on.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Commission has done nothing to date. Sean Tighe and his directors were strapped for cash, though theirs was a legislative body set up by the State. However, it has only been a talking shop to date. I hope Michael Farrell is given the support the Western Development Commission needs to create jobs in the west. We hear of meetings in the BMW region but what is happening on the ground? I see very little apart from signs declaring that everything is being funded by the NDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South Sligo Rapid Transport Group had Halcrow, a top consultant, carry out a study and that report was on the desk of the Minister for Public Enterprise but she has refused to meet the group until now. Last week we heard a new rail strategy announced and in Sligo-Leitrim there is talk of great possibilities. To date the Minister has refused to meet that group, though theirs is a <Col N="722" /> massive concept, involving rapid transport coming to south Sligo, then on to Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon. However, the Minister is playing politics with this, as the report sat on her desk for six months and nothing was achieved.</P>
    <P>I have asked numerous questions about the Claremorris line but the Minister has refused to fund a feasibility study on it up until now. Now she says it may go ahead.</P>

      <P>Being elected to Leinster House is a great privilege and one must point out inequalities. I return to the inner relief road, which is a huge issue in Sligo. I appeal to the Government to cut out the politics and to announce funding for the road now. We do not want the Minister to hide behind the NRA, as that is what he is doing. He is the paymaster and appoints the NRA but now he is saying the NRA is not accountable to him for funds. That does not wash. If the Government thinks it does, when the boxes are opened in Sligo-Leitrim after the next election the Government will get a very clear message. We want that money and the Government has no hope of a second seat in Sligo-Leitrim without it. I put that down as a major marker this evening and I expect the Minister to announce the funds are in place for the inner relief road.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that again the west is the first casualty when the tills are empty &ndash; the inner relief road, the Castlebaldwin by-pass and the N17, on which the Minister of State travels frequently. Where will money for the N17 come from?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately it is all spin. We have 75 spin doctors employed by the Government. As Deputy Ring said, the Government has been great for employment. It has the best spin doctors one can get &ndash; 75 of them. That is more doctors than most hospitals have under this Government. They are doing an excellent job; one only has to look at Independent Newspapers. The spin doctors must be very active with press releases. They are masters at spin. Our party leader, Deputy Noonan, said we will win the 42 rounds even if it is not a knockout. When the 42 battlegrounds are counted, the Government will know Deputy Noonan was right. I am sure that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we are sitting on the Government benches next June when the commitments to the west will be honoured. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, is from the west. He is an upfront type of person but, regrettably, he is not getting the type of support he should be getting <Col N="723" /> from the Government. There are issues of concern and areas of disadvantage in the west and the Border counties. I could speak for an hour about the needs and concerns of Sligo-Leitrim. Some £100 million is being pumped into the Northern counties, but only £400,000 is being given to the six Border counties through a sports capital grant. The Border counties, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, have not got anything. These issues must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The people will be waiting in the long grass when the election is called. The people know that the spin doctors will not be near the polling booths and they will not be able to influence the grassroots who will have their say. When the votes are counted, the spin doctors will be the first to leave.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill which implements the tax changes announced in the budget. Five years ago when we came to office, we made a commitment to deliver a fairer and more equitable and efficient taxation system. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has delivered that promise in the five budgets and five Finance Bills he has introduced. We should study the figures. A number of Opposition Deputies said that the people did not get anything from the changes in the taxation system in recent years. When I heard that, I wondered where they had been for the past five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath. He should travel around his constituency and ask the people if the changes in the taxation system increased their take home pay. It is as plain as the nose on my face that they did and people are extremely happy with the reduction in their tax payments. When we came into office in 1997, a person reached the top rate of tax on £13,600 per annum, which was below the average industrial wage in the first half of 1997. Following the budget of 2002, the same person will not pay tax at the higher rate until his or her income exceeds £22,052, which is comfortably above the average industrial wage, as the Minister said. The standard tax band has been widened significantly in the past number of budgets. That means that a further 57,000 taxpayers have been taken out of the top tax band. We have delivered on a promise we made to take the majority of people out of the top tax band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were increases in take home pay for everyone up to the middle of last year. Some £3.2 billion was returned to workers in personal tax reductions. That is a significant sum of money which the people appreciate. The people may be in the lush grass after our tremendous performance in Government over the past five years, but they will not come out to snare us. They will come <Col N="724" /> out to shoulder us back into power after the next election.</P>

      <P>The standard rate of tax has been cut from 26% to 20% and the higher rate of tax from 48% to 42%. The people will not forget that, regardless of how the Opposition tries to put a spin on it. The 310,000 people who have been removed from the tax net will not forget us. Some 268,000 workers were moved from the higher tax net to the standard tax net. More than 600,000 people have benefited from the taxation changes over the past five years. The Opposition says the people will not appreciate that. They will appreciate what they have received and the fact that we delivered on our promises. We will be able to stand before any crowd and say we have delivered on our promises. We will deliver on the promises and commitments we will make before the election when we are on this side of the House over the next five years.</P>

      <P>Section 3 gives effect to significant increases in basic tax credits resulting in further progress towards our aim of exempting those on the minimum wage from the tax net. The increase of more than 14% in the combined value of the personal and employee credits, which is provided for in the Bill, means that the entry point to the tax system for a single person will be over &euro;209 or £165 per week. That is 90% of the current minimum wage compared to £77 in 1997-98. A single income married couple in receipt of home carer's credit will be exempt from tax on the first &euro;430 per week. These are significant increases over the past five years. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will increase the figure of 90% to 100% in the Finance Bill next year, which is what Deputy Rabbitte wants.</P>
      <P>Some 71,500 elderly people have been taken out of the tax net. The increase in the exemption limit means that a single person on &euro;13,000 will be exempt from income tax. We have aimed to do that in recent years and we have delivered on it. That means that 79,000 elderly people will be exempt from income tax. These are significant figures.</P>

    <P>Medical expenses relief is important. Everyone realises that many families face significant medical costs. Many people, who look after family members, do not qualify for grants or for a carer's <Col N="725" /> allowance. The Minister has extended the tax relief not only for payments for immediate family members, but also for payments in respect of grandparents, grandchildren, non-relatives who are elderly individuals aged 65 years or over or those who are permanently incapacitated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply to my Adjournment debate. I am raising the issue of enhanced nursing home subvention for people in the Southern Health Board area. There are currently 344 elderly people on the waiting list in the Cork and Kerry area for enhanced nursing home subvention. This in itself is a very long list but I have learned from the health board that they are only dealing with applications now for this payment that were made in March 2001. The applications are almost a year behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the applicants for advanced subvention are very elderly people whose expenses far exceed their pension or any other income. Many <Col N="726" /> of them are struggling to scrape together the necessary funds to pay their accommodation fees in the nursing homes. Many of these people have been in nursing homes for many years and would have no place to go but for the goodwill of the staff and management of the nursing homes. One of the key features of a booming economy is its ability to care for its most vulnerable members. The issue I am raising tonight is evidence that the Government is failing to grasp the principle and act on it.</P>
    <P>In many of the cases I referred to, the people have no next of kin to support them or speak on their behalf. These are the voiceless people who are often not well enough informed about their right to apply for enhanced subvention where their income fails to meet the cost of their care. In some of the cases of which I am aware the management and staff of the nursing homes are deeply concerned about the plight of their patients who they care for with the greatest dedication and kindness. I pay tribute to the many hard-working and committed staff that I know in nursing homes in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister for Health and Children to speed up the processing of applications for enhanced subvention in the Southern Health Board area. It is completely unacceptable that there are almost 350 people on the waiting list for enhanced subvention in Cork and Kerry. It is totally unsatisfactory that these applications that were made a year ago are only being dealt with now. Where does this leave people that have only recently applied? Will they be kept waiting for another year and be forced to spend that time scraping together the necessary money to pay for their care? In many cases they just do not have the money.</P>
    <P>It has come to my attention that discussions are currently ongoing with the Department in regard to the overall arrangements that apply to the enhanced subvention scheme. I hope the Minister will be able to outline to the House the nature and content of these discussions. The Minister needs to tackle the waiting list for enhanced subvention in the Southern Health Board area by speeding up the processing of applications and he must also provide the necessary resources to do this. The voiceless and the vulnerable are again suffering as a result of this Government's failure to tackle the crisis in the health services. Many people are lying awake at night worrying that their application will not be processed before their money runs out. This situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue on the Adjournment. As the Deputy will be aware from previous discussion on this issue, under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. <Col N="727" /> Apart from contracts entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged are private arrangements between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment)(No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>Significant additional funding has been provided by Governments since its introduction in 1993. In 1994, in the first full year of operation of the nursing home subvention scheme, £12 million was made available. This year, the additional funding provided by the Department has brought the amount available for the scheme to £72 million or &euro;92 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin will be aware that the Southern Health Board received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for each board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. A solution has been found to meet the most immediate individual problems and discussions are continuing in an effort to reach agreement on a more long-term approach to the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it should be noted that the nursing home subvention regulations do not specify a maximum amount to be paid in respect of enhanced subvention. A decision relating to the amount to be paid is a matter for each health board, following assessment on a case by case basis and bearing in mind their obligation to comply with Article 20 of Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, as well as the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996. Article 20 of the regulations provides that, if under <Col N="728" /> section 31 of the Health Act, 1970, the Minister specifies a limit on the expenditure to be incurred in providing services under the Act, a board may pay such amounts as would enable it to contain its expenditure within the specified limit.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by the Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention to bring forward proposals in due course in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. As announced in the health strategy, which was published recently, it is also the intention of the Department to amend the nursing home subvention scheme to take account of the expenditure review of the scheme and to introduce a pilot home subvention scheme in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This will be carried out in the context of an integrated approach to meeting the needs of ageing and older people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment. I tried previously but failed. There are three services in Kerry dealing with the needs of autistic children. The Brothers of Charity have a special service in Tralee that treats cases from diagnosis until five years and 11 months.</P>
      <P>They operate in Tralee, Listowel and Killarney. In St. John's national school, Balloonagh, Tralee, a mainstream primary school for girls, there is one class for autistic children in which two pupils are enrolled.</P>
      <P>Nano Nagle special school in Listowel caters for the moderately to severely mentally handicapped. It has 65 pupils, all of whom have moderate or severe degrees of mental handicap and some of whom have been diagnosed as autistic. For the past year one class of six autistic children has been housed in a portacabin to the rear of the school. There is a proposal to build two classrooms, but this is inadequate. At least four are required for classes of six pupils each. The reason for this is that the incidence of autism in County Kerry is increasing. The children range in age from six to 18 years and it will be impossible, from an educational point of view, to accommodate them in just two classrooms. Architects from the Department were on site yesterday and informed the board of management that it will be at least three years before the two classrooms are provided. Four classes should be provided as soon as possible. I cannot see any reason this cannot happen before three years are up. It should be quite simple to design and build them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" />A commitment was given to draw up a database of the number of people affected by autism in County Kerry. That has not happened and there are no clear statistics available to indicate the number with autism. I would like the Minister of State to indicate what is happening. There are 30 autistic adults at St. Finian's in Killarney and St. Mary of the Angels in Beaufort and we should look at services for them as well as at those for children. They are not suitable places for people with autism for whom County Kerry needs a centre. The task force on autism, established four years ago, has not reported and I would like the Minister of State to say when its final report is to be published.</P>
    <P>I speak on behalf of a number of very concerned parents. Services in County Kerry are inadequate and probably inferior to those in every other county. I would like the Minister of State to offer the parents concerned some hope at least.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the opportunity to outline the position on this issue.</P>
      <P>Specific funding has been targeted at enhancing the level of support available to children with autism and their families. Between 1998 and 2000, &euro;6.35 million additional funding was provided to expand the level of health related support services available to them. A further &euro;4.44 million was allocated in 2001 for these services for both children with autism and those with an intellectual disability. Additional funding amounting to &euro;3.809 million is also being made available for these services in 2002 which will be aimed at assessment and diagnostic services, early intervention, pre-school and outreach support for school children, which services are provided by multidisciplinary teams which include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, project workers and other support staff.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services for persons with autism in County Kerry is a matter, in the first instance, for the Southern Health Board. Between 1999 and 2000 additional revenue funding amounting to &euro;724,000 was allocated to the board to enhance health related support services for children with autism. A further &euro;317,000 was made available in 2001 and another &euro;317,000 will come on stream in 2002 for health related support services for both children with autism and those with an intellectual disability. I have been informed by the board that a total of 28.5 posts have to date been allocated to the health related support services for children with autism from the specific funding given to it for this purpose. The services will be further expanded in 2002 as a result of the additional funding which has now been made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions relating to the precise services to be put in place as a result of the additional 2002 <Col N="730" /> funding are a matter for the Southern Health Board and will take account of the priorities identified for the region. This process is under way. A considerable proportion of these resources have been allocated to establish a regional assessment team managed by the Brothers of Charity Southern Services on behalf of the region. Funding for two speech and language therapists and a psychologist has been allocated to date, specifically for services in County Kerry. The board has established an autistic spectrum disorder steering group which is representative of the main service providers in each catchment area and also includes the regional autistic spectrum disorder co-ordinator. Part of the remit of this group is to finalise a regional development plan for the services which will be undertaken through a research project, in consultation with various representative parent groups, to establish the number of persons with autistic spectrum disorder in the region. This work is ongoing.</P>
    <P>One of the areas of concern to the families is access to and availability of support services such as occupational and speech and language therapy. Many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting the necessary professionals required to deliver these services due, primarily, to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In response to his concern regarding the severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide the Minister commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists. The study, a comprehensive assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in these areas up to 2015, was published in July 2001. The Minister is now working with the Minister for Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority to increase the numbers training for these professions in line with the needs identified in the report. His Department is also undertaking a number of initiatives in relation to the career structures, workload, working practices and skill mix issues of those identified in the report of the expert group on various health professionals. All these measures, together with continued investment in the services, will greatly assist with delivery of an enhanced level of support in these areas to persons with autism and their families.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the continued development of services for persons with autism and working with the Southern Health Board to bring about an enhanced level of support for those availing of its services.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Game Fishing Season Postponement.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue. I have a very simple request to <Col N="731" /> make of the Minister and I hope he will find it possible to accede to it.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, made an order deferring the normal opening of the fishing season on the River Barrow from 1 March to 17 March to take account of the presence of spring salmon in the river in that early part of the season.</P>
      <P>We have experienced four seasons of that deferral of the opening of the fishing season and I have been informed that in those four years no salmon have been found on the upper reaches of the River Barrow, that is, upstream of Athy. I am sure the Minister will appreciate that anglers on the upper reaches of the River Barrow now find that their fishing season is being artificially restricted because of the fear of interference with the spring run of salmon. Since no salmon have been found over the past four years on the upper reaches of the River Barrow, upstream of Athy, they ask now that an order be made opening the fishery on that part of the river on the normal date, 1 March, so they can regain the period of almost three weeks which has been lost to them each season for the past four seasons in their fisheries.</P>
      <P>I am sure it will be possible for the Minister to verify the accuracy of what I am saying. As I understand it, the order was made in 1998 at the request of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board. I am not entirely sure whether all of the angler groups on the river were in entire agreement at that stage. My impression is that they went along with the proposal because of their concern with conservation but, as I have said, the experience of the past four years is that salmon do not penetrate to the upper reaches of the river. For that reason it seems to me entirely appropriate, and not at all out of keeping with the conservation and management policies which I know the Minister is anxious to promote, to recognise the factual situation on the upper reaches of the river and to make an order or take whatever steps are appropriate to allow the fishing to open upstream of Athy as and from 1 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The opening of the salmon and trout angling season in the Waterford fishery district, which includes the River Barrow, was postponed from 1 March to 17 March, as the Deputy stated, by my predecessor, Deputy Woods, in 1998 at the request of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board in the interest of conserving spring salmon which had declined dramatically in that district in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board also recommended that the trout angling season should be postponed along with the salmon season because persons fishing for trout could also take salmon. Even if salmon inadvertently taken were released they may die later from injuries, thus adversely affecting stocks. There are no proposals at this time to alter <Col N="732" /> the angling season in that district. The Marine Institute's advice to me remains that salmon stocks in the Waterford fishery district, and in particular the very vulnerable spring salmon, are in a critical situation.</P>
    <P>The conservation measures in place in this district must also be viewed in the context of the national effort to conserve and enhance salmon stocks. On 10 January last, I announced additional conservation measures on top of those already in place to strengthen the ongoing effort to arrest the decline in salmon stocks nationally. In particular, I announced the introduction of quotas for commercial fishing on a district basis for the forthcoming season. I also announced that I would review the case for standardising the length of offshore nets and that I would consider changes to the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders to deliver a significant rationalisation of categories and the number of commercial licences held. In addition, I indicated that I would examine the case of increasing the current licence fees for 2003.</P>
    <P>These new measures are absolutely necessary to address the current difficult stock situation. While they represent a significant challenge to the commercial sector I want to re-emphasise my commitment to a sustainable commercial salmon fishery based on value rather than volume.</P>
    <P>I was not aware of the situation as outlined by the Deputy, that there have been no salmon found in the past four years north of Athy. In view of the points he has made, I am certainly prepared to look at the situation again and I will then revert to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter on the Adjournment. The Minister will be aware that we were all called to a meeting recently in Killala. He met that group in Ballina and there were further meetings which took place in Connemara.</P>
      <P>Commercial fishermen are concerned because they feel that their livelihood is being attacked. It is not for the first time; this has happened over the past 20 years. They seem to be paying the biggest price of the reduction in salmon fishing.</P>
      <P>These people are working in a very difficult and dangerous industry. They have been restricted in the past and if something is not done now, they feel that the industry will be wiped out. It is difficult enough to get fathers to pass on this way of life to their sons or daughters and they are finding it even more difficult now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting in Killala they outlined a number of reasons for the Minister's actions. They are concerned that there are others interests involved which are being protected more than the interests of these fishermen. They have asked that a three-point plan be put in place and I want to put that to the Minister. I am glad that he took a reasonable approach to the case made by Deputy Dukes and I hope he will do the same for the fishermen <Col N="733" /> in the west. They are talking about a three-point plan. First, they are looking for compensation, in other words, to be bought out. They are asking that those in this industry be given a bit of dignity and be bought out at a reasonable price. There was never as much money in the coffers. I heard tonight that the Minister for Finance is able to provide tax relief to sports persons who are making plenty of money. Here is an industry which is dying on its feet and these are people who are finding it very hard to make a living, and I cannot see why the Government cannot buy out the people who want to get out at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>The second measure in the plan is a reasonable fish quota on which they would be able to make a living. At present that is not the case simply because they are not getting the price they want. They are certainly finding it very difficult with the current quota.</P>
    <P>The third measure they want is set-aside. That would put them out for a number of years, but they want reasonable compensation from the Minister. The Minister's proposal is that the Department would pay a certain amount of money, about £1,500, and that the angling clubs would pay the remaining £1,500. He knows the angling clubs will not pay that kind of money.</P>
    <P>They also are concerned that they have obeyed the laws of the land. They were asked to tag the salmon and to bring their books to the Department, and all these people did so. That did not happen in the case of the anglers who were asked to tag and do their share, but did not do so.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from the west, I ask the Minister, who is from the west, to recognise that this is a problem of the west. It is certainly a problem for rural areas. We are finding it difficult enough to keep people in rural areas. These people feel that the Department is more concerned about the preservation of salmon than the preservation of their livelihoods and they feel they are not being looked after. They feel that they and their families are being attacked, that they just will not be allowed to fish in the future.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take the three-point plan on board and to do something for these people. Their lives are difficult enough. When these boats leave the shores at night their families never know whether they will come back. They work under difficult circumstances. It is not an easy life and they do not make a fortune. It is a way of life and an industry for them and it is not as if we have many alternative sources of employment for them. I ask the Minister to go back to his Department and return with a proposal that will solve this problem, that will compensate the people who want to get out, that will give a quota to the people who want to stay and, if he is going to produce the set-aside, that will give them reasonable compensation. It is a reasonable request and I hope Deputy Fahey, as a Minister from the west, can see fit to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have taken a reasonable approach with respect to the commercial netsmen <Col N="734" /> in the west and around the coast. In fact, I am particularly concerned about the livelihoods of commercial fishermen. I am also concerned about the conservation of wild salmon. My main concern is to ensure that we conserve and manage the stock of wild salmon in a significant way. The commercial net fishermen will benefit from that most of all. The first priority for the Department is to introduce a programme of conservation and management of wild salmon. If we do not do that, then the stock which has been declining in a serious way &ndash; and the commercial net men of north Mayo would be the first to tell me that &ndash; will continue to decline and before very long there will not be a livelihood in it for anybody. It is important to note that it is in everybody's interests that we conserve wild salmon, manage it properly and grow the stock again.</P>
      <P>I am the first Minister to have tackled this problem. Many people have talked about it, but I have taken action. I have looked at ways of conserving wild salmon while not seriously affecting those who benefit from it. The best way forward is the introduction of a quota system, the control of fishing for salmon orders, reviewing the introduction of safety days &ndash; as requested by the sector &ndash; and I have requested the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Island, Deputy De Valera, to initiate comprehensive seal management measures including appropriate population control. I have received recommendations from various interests to standardise the lengths of net from 732 m and 1,372 m to a standard to 1,000 m in all districts. The north-west is the only part of the country where 1,372 m nets are used. I am prepared to look at that issue in my discussions with commercial salmon fishermen.</P>
      <P>A buy out will not provide the answer. The only people interested in selling their licences are those who fish very little. Consequently, buying out licences will not do anything to conserve salmon. As that is our first priority, we have decided there is no benefit in buy outs. Even if we were to contemplate that, the very small amount of money that we would offer people would be an insult to them &ndash; they have told me that. A second option is set aside schemes. We have successfully introduced this in a number of coastal locations where there is local agreement between the fishing clubs, river owners and the net men. I have told the fishermen in Mayo that if that kind of agreement can be reached, I would be happy to add to the amount of money which would be agreed between them. Those are localised schemes with which the Department would only get involved if there is local agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In each case one cannot do one thing, attempt to introduce a three point plan to do another, while at the same time introducing quotas. There is a misunderstanding on the part of the Deputy in that respect. Unless there were to be a full group of people in a catchment prepared to sell their licences and we were prepared to buy them, it would not make any sense. Buying out some of <Col N="735" /> them would only leave extra salmon for the others, it is the same for set aside.</P>
    <P>To protect the livelihoods of salmon fishermen, it is best to introduce a quota so that we can have a reduction in the amount of salmon caught this year. That would make a significant contribution to starting the conservation programme. We have asked anglers to do the same, whereby there is a limit of one fish per rod per day. They are not allowed to sell rod caught fish. I hope to assist the wild salmon commercial fishermen in the proper sale and marketing of their product. They are selling their salmon at a much lower price than they should be, it is as low as &euro;1.50 per pound. Through a producer group we will establish with <Col N="736" /> them, we intend to help increase the value of wild salmon through a promotional and marketing programme.</P>
    <P>I have been very reasonable in my approach. I am most anxious to ensure that we protect the traditional rights of inshore fishermen. My overriding concern is that they will not have a future if we do not put conservation measures in place. That is what we are doing and I am confident we will begin to save and expand the stock of wild salmon so that tourist anglers, local leisure anglers and commercial net men will benefit in the long run.</P>

    <P>The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. In addition the chief of staff has discretion to have 250 recruits in training at any given time, over and above this figure of 10,500.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces in the year 2002 to fill vacancies as required. I launched the Defence Forces 2002 general service recruiting campaign yesterday and this will be followed by national and local media advertising.</P>
    <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, I decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to five feet, four inches.</P>

      <P>The public service benchmarking body established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is currently in the middle of its deliberations and is due to produce its recommendations by 30 June 2002. I believe, in these circumstances, that it would be entirely inappropriate for me to make any comment whatsoever on this matter, lest my comments be perceived as an attempt to influence the deliberations of the Honourable Mr. Justice Quirke and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>What I can say is that every public service trade union and representative association was afforded the opportunity to make written and oral submissions to the benchmarking body and, to the best of my knowledge, all did. However, the pay increases, if any, to be awarded on foot of these submissions, are matters for the benchmarking body alone to consider.</P>
      <P>The benchmarking process is a genuine attempt to set pay levels for the Irish public service in the context of the Irish economy. Benchmarking represents an open, independent, innovative and progressive way of tackling the issue of setting appropriate pay levels. The process has provided the Defence Forces representative associations with an opportunity to present their case in relation to their members' pay levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my conviction that by operating within the framework of national programmes like the PPF <Col N="741" /> and using the benchmarking process, we will continue to make economic and social progress in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 70, and 123 together.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 agreed on a voluntary timeframe for establishing a capability to deploy within 60 days and to sustain for at least one year forces of up to 50,000 to 60,000 persons capable of the full range of humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks known as Petersberg Tasks.</P>
      <P>This target, known as the Helsinki Headline Goal, was developed in the light of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which was approved in Ireland by referendum in May, 1998, and derives from the decisions taken by European heads of state and government at the subsequent EU Councils.</P>
      <P>The EU has accomplished substantial progress towards achieving that goal, and at the Laeken European Council in December 2001, a declaration that the EU is now able to conduct some crisis management operations was adopted. Although considerable work is still in progress, the Laeken declaration represents a significant step towards the development of co-operation between EU members to voluntarily undertake humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structures and procedures which are being developed at EU level are designed to enhance co-operation between countries participating on the prospective Petersberg Tasks which I have just outlined. I believe that these are objectives which are close to Irish hearts. Deputies on all sides are consistent in expressing pride in Ireland's tradition of providing support to <Col N="742" /> peoples of other countries in times of need. Our support has ranged from generous individual donations to voluntary organisations operating in countries afflicted by famine and disease; through increased Government aid to such organisations placing Ireland at the forefront of international donor countries; and not least the exemplary record of our Defence Forces in countries suffering from the consequences of conflict, such as Lebanon and East Timor.</P>
    <P>The EU recognises the primary responsibility of the UN for the maintenance of international peace and security. The development of a European security and defence policy will help to promote international peace and stability, and Ireland's contribution of professional expertise and experience gained from many years of participation on United Nations missions represents a pragmatic and worthy progression of our international peacekeeping tradition.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to the Headline Goal was made at a capabilities commitment conference which was held at Brussels in November 2000. Our contribution consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations standby arrangements system, UNSAS. This represents some 10% of our Army &ndash; not an inconsiderable undertaking by any standard. The largest element will consist of a light infantry battalion of up to 750 personnel. In addition, an Army Ranger Wing platoon of 40 personnel and small numbers of national support, headquarters and observer elements have been offered and will make up the remainder.</P>
    <P>On 19 November 2001, I attended a capabilities improvement conference, CIC, in Brussels. At the conference, I reaffirmed Ireland's contribution of 850 personnel, and outlined the progress which, has been made with regard to the Governments commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are suitably prepared for future challenges which may arise in the context of participation in Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>There has been an unfortunate tendency in some quarters to misinterpret terms such as rapid reaction force and to imply that it is the creation of a European Army. This is not the case. The declaration adopted by the EU Council at Laeken stressed that &ldquo;the development of military capabilities does not imply the creation of a European army.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition, national sovereignty is an underlying principle to participation in the European security and defence policy and Ireland will only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 954, the Defence (Amendment) No 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. The decisions on participation taken by individual member states will subsequently be confirmed through the framework of the EU Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to the impression frequently conveyed in some quarters, there is nothing in the European security and defence policy, or in the EU treaties &ndash; including the Nice treaty &ndash; that points Ireland in the direction of participating in a European army.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asks if the Defence Forces will be taking part in the first military exercise of the European Union's rapid reaction force in May 2002. The answer is that there is no military exercise in May 2002 in the context of European security and defence policy, ESDP.</P>
      <P>Rather, the EU is undertaking a crisis management exercise, CME02, to exercise and evaluate the full range of the EU's crisis management procedures and structures at the pre-decisional phase of the decision-making process in relation to a possible Petersberg operation. The aim of the exercise is to ensure the full range of civilian and military instruments is properly co-ordinated in order to help to ensure readiness and the necessary co-ordination between the EU's civilian and military instruments.</P>
      <P>For the EU to be in a position to be able to act effectively in crisis management circumstances, it must be able to deploy the full range of civilian and military means at its disposal in a coherent and co-ordinated manner. Priority is being accorded to developing instruments and modalities for civil-military co-ordination in the ESDP context. Crisis management procedures are being developed that should guarantee quick, effective and coherent decision-making in Petersberg tasks-type situations. CME02 will be used to evaluate and refine these crisis management procedures in the light of the experience gained during the exercise.</P>
      <P>The EU exercise programme covers the period 2001-2006, with a sequence of exercises designed to ensure appropriate readiness and efficient functioning in a crisis management situation. The exercises are designed to ensure the EU structures, procedures &ndash; including consultation with the UN &ndash; and arrangements are properly tested and validated in order to ensure appropriate readiness and efficient functioning in a Petersberg Task-type crisis. The EU does not intend to engage in military field exercises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 42 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Two CASA aircraft &ndash; C252 and C253 &ndash; were delivered in 1994 under the 1991 to 1995 fishery protection support programme. The cost of both aircraft &ndash; inclusive of VAT &ndash; amounted to approximately &euro;55.3 million, £43.6 million, of which approximately &euro;22.9 million, £18 million, was refunded by the EU. The aircraft are fully equipped for fishery protection duties.</P>
      <P>In implementing the terms of the fisheries surveillance package, the Commission took the general position that where capital assets were overwhelmingly dedicated to fisheries protection the full eligible expenditure would receive Community support. It was on that basis that the Commission partly funded the cost of the CASA aircraft. It has been regularly confirmed by the Irish authorities to the Commission that the vast proportion of CASA time is demonstrably spent on fisheries protection. The fact that the aircraft are primarily tasked with fisheries protection has not precluded their deployment from time to time on search and rescue, air ambulance, security and transport duties.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, has primary responsibility for fisheries protection. Relevant requirements relate to efficient and effective standards of fisheries protection service delivery by the Naval Service and the Air Corps. Service delivery is based on agreed outputs in line with overall fisheries protection priorities agreed each year. The relevant CASA outputs are the numbers of fisheries patrols, flying hours and vessel sightings.</P>
      <P>These outputs are reported on annually to the Commission by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. In 2001 the CASA aircraft undertook 277 fishery patrols, involving 1,390 flying hours, and recorded over 5,000 sightings of fishing vessels. The figures for 2000 are 252 fishery patrols involving 1,317 flying hours and recording over 5,000 sightings of fishing vessels. These levels of activity are broadly in line with performance in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of flying missions undertaken by the CASA aircraft in 2001 amounted to 370, 1,662 flying hours, of which 13, 42 flying hours, related <Col N="745" /> to ministerial transport. The flying time relating to ministerial transport amounted to 2.5% of the overall flying time in 2001. In 2000 the number of flying missions undertaken by the CASA aircraft amounted to 339, 1557 flying hours, of which 12, 33 flying hours, related to Ministerial transport. The flying time relating to ministerial transport amounted to 2.1% of the overall flying time in 2000.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a satisfactory and effective fisheries protection service, utilising existing resources, is being provided by both the Air Corps and Naval Service and that the occasional use of the CASA aircraft for purposes such as search and rescue, air ambulance and occasional transport is consistent with the position regarding the primacy of the fisheries protection role, as conveyed to the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Baldonnel Aerodrome is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel as outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland. I have no plans at present for other developments at the aerodrome.</P>
      <P>I will, however, keep the matter under review to determine whether greater use might be made of this important resource. As the Deputy may be aware the position of Baldonnel was considered in the Warburg Dillon Read/AIB report, 1999 which assessed the merits of a second airport in Dublin on behalf of the Department of Public Enterprise, and concluded there was no requirement for the State to promote or develop a second civil airport for the Dublin region at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Baldonnel, the advisors saw no reason to hinder commercial development at the aerodrome subject to appropriate planning approvals. The needs of the Air Corps will continue to be of primary importance. However, before any consideration can be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel, it will be necessary to bring Baldonnel Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish <Col N="746" /> Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. This is a matter for the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>

      <P>In the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that a comprehensive integrated Defence Forces personnel management plan would be prepared by military management as a matter of priority. This plan will set down policies and goals to ensure that personnel policies and practices keep pace with the current best practice to the benefit of the Defence Forces organisation and those who serve in the Defence Forces. The proposed integrated personnel management plan, which is being prepared by the chief of staff, will address the particular issue raised by the Deputy and will establish a range of career development structures for all ranks and an active personnel management framework to address Defence Forces requirements over the coming decade.</P>
      <P>The development of a career skills training policy for other ranks personnel, which will combine with the integrated personnel management system, is ongoing at headquarters of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 62, 74, 86, 87 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of air defence is being examined by the military authorities in the light of the terrible events of 11 September. This examination includes the equipment required for that purpose. In that regard, the Department has purchased several batteries of air defence guns, including radars, from the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The radar systems will have the capacity to detect overflights by aircraft. The equipment will be delivered over the next two to three months and will significantly enhance the air defence capabilities of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The possible acquisition of aircraft to fulfil an air defence role is also a consideration. In the detailed planning for the acquisition of training aircraft for the Irish Air Corps, consideration will be given to the possibility of including air defence capabilities in the aircraft.</P>
      <P>The most important defence against any terrorist attacks is detection and prevention by the security forces. The level of any terrorist threat is being continually assessed. The advice available to me would suggest that there is no reason to believe that Ireland or Irish airspace is a direct target. However, it is prudent that we take precautions and keep matters under continuous review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's response to the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions was announced by the Minister for Finance on 28 September 2001. The Government accepted the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and directed that the working group to advise on implementation, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, be established. The operational details of the implementation of the commission's recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the working group, to be made within six months. The Government also decided to establish parallel structures &ndash; subject to the same timeframe and remit &ndash; in the case of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána. Arrangements are also being made to facilitate pensioner group representation in respect of the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy.</P>
      <P>I understand that a plenary meeting of the PPF pensions working group took place on 10 January 2002 when it was agreed to establish two subgroups. The main sub-group held its first meeting on 31 January and its remit includes all issues arising from the commission's report other than those relating to pension increases which will be considered by a second subgroup. The second subgroup will include representation from pensioner groups and will begin its task once a consultation process with pensioners has been completed. The establishment of parallel structures for the Defence Forces is being actively addressed in my Department and it is hoped that it will be possible to have appropriate structures put in place in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of reckoning military service allowance, MSA, in the calculation of the pensions of pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the position is that arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission, MSA &ndash; which had been introduced in 1979 &ndash; was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after the 1 August 1990. This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy, which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners. The Commission on Public Service Pen<Col N="749" /> sions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including MSA, and the consequences for pensioners generally in its final report. However, the commission, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long-standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised in the context of the Government's consideration of the commission's final report. This issue would not come within the scope of the parallel structures for the Defence Forces.</P>

    <P>A total of four Irish military personnel, including head of military staff, Brussels, is attached to the liaison office of Ireland to Partnership for Peace which is located at NATO headquarters in Brussels. A fifth officer acts as the KFOR-SFOR liaison officer and military representative to the Partnership Co-operation Cell-SHAPE located in Mons. These officers fulfil roles as liaison officers in the context of our participation in Partnership for Peace and Defence Forces participation in SFOR and KFOR.</P>
    <P>As regards commitments to be met by the Defence Forces in relation to overseas missions in 2002, the position is that, on 26 June 2001, the Government approved the provision of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service with: (i) the UN-authorised multinational stabilisation force &ndash; SFOR &ndash; in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and (ii) the international security presence in Kosovo known as KFOR, for a further period of <Col N="751" /> 12 months from June 2001. The Government further authorised the making of preparations for the selection, training and equipping of further contingents of the Permanent Defence Force to provide for the possibility of Ireland's continuing participation in those missions beyond June 2002.</P>
    <P>On 18 July 2001, the Government approved the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea &ndash; UNMEE &ndash; for a period of one year from December 2001. On 26 October 2001, Dáil Éireann approved the despatch of the contingent. On 5 September 2001, the Government authorised me to inform the UN Secretariat, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, that Ireland is agreeable in principle to continue to provide Defence Forces personnel to the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor &ndash; UNTAET &ndash; and any follow-on mission in East Timor until October 2002.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps at present has 17 fixed wing aircraft and 13 helicopters, which are used for the following purposes: (a) seven Siai-Marchetti SF 260W aircraft of Italian manufacture which are being used for basic pilot training; (b) six Cessna aircraft of American design and French manufacture are held &ndash; these are Army co-operation aircraft with some offensive &ndash; air to ground &ndash; capability and with training capability; (c) one Beech Super Kingair twin-engined turbo-prop aircraft, which is used for backup to the minis<Col N="752" /> terial air transport service and for twin-engined pilot training; (d) one Gulfstream IV aircraft was acquired in December 1991 for the transport of Ministers and officials &ndash; it was leased for ten years from 1991 and was purchased in December 2001 on termination of lease; (e) two CASA CN 235 aircraft, which are used mainly for fishery surveillance purposes; (f) seven Alouette III helicopters are held. They are used for search and rescue, air ambulance and other services and have proved valuable in security operations; (g) two Gazelle helicopters, which are used for pilot training; (h) four SA 365F Dauphin helicopters, which are used for search and rescue.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps does not have a troop or equipment transport capability at present. However, the contract to be placed this year for the supply of medium-range helicopters for search and rescue will include an option to purchase a further two such helicopters for general purpose military transport. The trainer aircraft presently available to the Air Corps are over 20 years old. The question of the acquisition of new training aircraft for the Air Corps has been under consideration by my Department for some time. Tender documents have been prepared and it is intended to seek quotations for such aircraft this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 67 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The sale of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy to Cork County Council, in conjunction with the IDA, for &euro;973,889, £767, 000, has been completed. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" />The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for &euro;380,921, £300,000, all for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for &euro;8,888,167, £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly. In relation to Castleblayney, the property has been sold to the North-Eastern Health Board for &euro;761,843, £600,000, and the legal formalities are now completed.</P>
    <P>The integrated action area plan, which was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the former Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig has now been adopted by Cork County Council. A tender competition has been held for the appointment of selling agents for the former barracks and it is expected that an appointment will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide circa one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In relation to the remainder of this site I am arranging early discussions with all the interested parties including the local authority.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on the 14 June 2001. Two bids were received one of which was from Dublin City Council. Both tenders were considered too low to permit acceptance. My Department is, of course, prepared to talk to any party interested in purchasing the property, which remains on the market and in this regard ongoing discussions are taking place with officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dublin City Council. It is my intention to generate the maximum return from the site for re-investment in essential Defence Forces needs. As a portion of Clancy Barracks is currently being used to accommodate the homeless, some of the security costs for the barracks will be recouped from Dublin City Council.</P>
    <P>Arising from the temporary provision of accommodation for asylum seekers the cost of security at Magee Barracks, Kildare is now met by the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Castleblayney Military Barracks was transferred to the North-Eastern Health Board on a caretaker basis on 9 February 2000 and the former Fitzgerald Camp in Fermoy has been sold to Cork County Council and no further costs will fall to be met by my Department in relation to either of these properties.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure in relation to the former barracks since closure now stands at &euro;2,062,805, <Col N="754" /> £1,624,591. The total costs include expenditure on security, utilities, maintenance, advertising, etc.</P>
    <P>Significant savings have arisen since the evacuation of the six barracks placed under private security arrangements. On military security duty alone, it is estimated that savings to date exceed &euro;1,423,253, £1,120,903. In addition, there have been significant savings on utility costs, such as telephone, gas and electricity charges at each of the evacuated barracks which, for example, would have amounted to approximately &euro;230,949, £181,887, in the case of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.</P>

      <P>Pending the establishment of crash rescue facilities at Finner Camp, the Air Corps temporarily relocated to Sligo Airport on 9 January 2001 and provided the 24 hour search and rescue service from that location. However, all the relevant fire fighting equipment, including a fire tender and a fully trained fire rescue service were put in place at Finner Camp, County Donegal and this allowed the SAR service to resume on 4 December 2001 at that location.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, the safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is of paramount importance. The adequacy of facilities at Finner Camp, including for SAR purposes, are kept under constant review taking account of ongoing operational requirements. Since 1997, approximately &euro;1.3 million has been spent at Finner Camp on refurbishment projects which included <i>inter alia </i>upgrading runway lights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Following a tender competition which was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers, APCs, initial spares, special tools and training courses.</P>
      <P>The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of &euro;50.8 million, including VAT.</P>
      <P>The full production run on the APCs is almost complete. A total of 32 APCs have now been delivered to the Curragh Camp. A further five APCs are scheduled for delivery on or before 22 February 2002. The balance, i.e. three APCs will be delivered by the end of March 2002 &ndash; almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
      <P>Training of Defence Force personnel on the APCs has been continuing apace and the first overseas deployment of the APCs has taken place with the dispatch of five APCs to Eritrea for service with UNMEE. A further APC is due to be dispatched for service in Eritrea in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 2001, the appearance of cracks in the hulls of three APCs was noticed in the Curragh Camp. The issue was dealt with as a warranty <Col N="756" /> item under the guarantee given by Mowag under the contract. Detailed discussions took place between Mowag and the Department on the cracks and expert investigations were put in train to determine their exact cause. I am advised that these cracks are not entirely unusual because of the type of manufacturing process involved in the production of the steel hulls of the APCs.</P>
    <P>As a result of the investigations, a range of remedial actions has been taken to deal with the issues raised as a result of the appearance of the cracks and the cracks on the three APCs were repaired. Since then, cracks have also appeared in the hulls of four other APCs and again they have being dealt with as a warranty item. Firing tests have shown that the repairs to the hulls will not affect the integrity of the ballistic protection afforded by the APCs. The military authorities are happy with the method of repair of the APCs in question. An extended warranty from one to five years has been agreed with Mowag to cover the Department against the possibility of the appearance of cracks in any of the 40 APCs to be delivered under the contract.</P>
    <P>The current contract contains an option for the supply of up to 40 additional APCs. This option is exercisable until January 2003. Discussions took place with representatives from Mowag in the latter months of 2001 on the option clause. However because of the cracks, it was considered prudent to leave any uptake of the option for the present time. The matter will be revisited later this year when the current APCs have been operational for a period of time.</P>

      <P>By 31 January 2002 a total of 16,094 claims had been received in my Department from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. Some 254 claims have been the subject of court awards with a further 10,331 being disposed of through out-of-court settlements. A further 467 claims were either withdrawn by plaintiffs or dismissed by the courts. Some 5,042 claims are still outstanding.</P>
      <P>Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the leading Army hearing loss case of Hanley, which was delivered in December 1999, my Department in conjunction with the Chief State Solicitor's Office in consultation with the Law Society of Ireland, established an early settlement scheme for dealing with the outstanding Army hearing loss litigation claims. The scheme operated successfully on a pilot basis during the year 2000 and 1,099 claims were settled by way of direct negotiations between solicitors representing plaintiffs and officials of the Chief State Solicitor's Office and my Department.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the early settlement scheme for the disposal of Army hearing loss claims commenced in January 2001. At that time five firms of loss adjusters were engaged to augment the resources of the Chief State Solicitor's Office in negotiating settlements with plaintiffs' solicitors. This second phase of the early settlement scheme has been successful in settling a further 2,420 cases.</P>
      <P>I am happy at the success of the scheme and the results achieved and hope that the vast majority of the 5,042 outstanding claims will be settled in this way, so that the remaining plaintiffs can have their claims resolved at fair levels of compensation with significant savings to the Exchequer in court costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>Following an extensive examination of various proposals down the years, it has been decided that the most suitable location in which to display artefacts that portray the history of the Defence Forces is the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Discussions have taken place between the military authorities and officials of the National Museum of Ireland. I understand that plans for a military history exhibition at the museum are in train and the museum anticipates that an area dedicated to this display will be open to the public during late 2003.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Seamus Brennan, formed an advisory committee which had been examining the various options for establishing a national aviation centre at which Ireland's contribution to the development of aviation could be preserved. It had been hoped that many of Ireland's aviation artefacts could be housed in one purpose designed location in a manner which would be attractive to tourists and aviation enthusiasts as well of having a significant educational element.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee had agreed that investment from the aviation sector was critical to the viability of the project. However, the prospects of attracting such investment were severely affected following the 11 September attacks on the United States. In the circumstances, the project has been suspended for the time being. In the meantime, Air Corps artefacts are under good care at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research is also ongoing by the military authorities towards the establishment of museums at <Col N="759" /> Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel and the Naval Base, Haulbowline, with a view to ensuring the role played by the Air Corps in the development of aviation in Ireland and the history of the Naval Service and its contribution to the State are appropriately recorded.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Government moved quickly and decisively to respond to the evolving international situation. In replies to previous questions to the House on 4 December 2001, I outlined details in relation to the establishment of the Government task force on emergency planning and the office of emergency planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" />A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is continuing. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency. As chairman of the task force, I intend that such responses would be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements. The task force has been meeting regularly to review the various emergency planning and response issues. The role of this task force is to ensure a co-ordinated and effective response to large-scale emergencies.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report to the House that there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and agencies through the task force on emergency planning, the office of emergency planning and the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning.</P>
    <P>The office of emergency planning provides a key support to the task force and co-ordinates the work of the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning to meet the new threats arising from international terrorism. The existing lead role of Departments and agencies in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will continue.</P>
    <P>The review of existing emergency plans has been conducted in the light of current developments and initial review shows that there are sound arrangements within the relevant Departments and agencies for dealing with emergency issues. The technical expertise and emergency planning skills that are required are available but there is a need to further the training and development of expertise in this important area.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the public confidence issue involved in emergency planning. It is imperative that the information being presented to both the media and the public be aimed at developing understanding of the issues and likely responses that any emergency may require.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the task force, I presented the first report of the task force to Government on 11 December 2001 and I would like to thank those who have been actively involved across a range of disciplines, Departments and agencies in supporting the work of task force. I will continue to report regularly to Government and to this House on the progress being made.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, as a result of public concern last year regarding possible environmental and <Col N="761" /> health risks relating to the use of depleted uranium &ndash; DU &ndash; weapons in the Balkans, the Defence Forces put in place a medical screening programme for all Irish troops who have served or are serving in the Balkan region as well as personnel who served as military observers in Kuwait following the Gulf War. All personnel, including those who have retired, were called to the various brigade centres to undergo the screening. Not all personnel responded or availed of the offer of such health screening. The screening process is still ongoing.</P>
      <P>The screening programme commenced in January 2001. This medical screening programme was put in place to provide reassurance for personnel and their families and includes blood and urine tests along with a clinical examination.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that since January 2001, a medical officer has conducted the screening process, in theatre prior to their repatriation, of each member of the Defence Forces who has served with KFOR and SFOR.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The question of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review.</P>
      <P>Requests from the UN for Irish participation in new missions are considered on a case by case basis within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangement System, UNSAS. As I have indicated to the House previously, in October 1998 Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations in relation to UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 military personnel for UN service at any one time under this system. There would be no obligation, however, to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval would be required for the despatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" />There exists a standing interdepartmental committee on peacekeeping, under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs, whose function, <i>inter alia</i>, is to provide a forum for the exchange of views on policy issues relating to Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping with a view to increasing the effectiveness and coherence of policy in this area and to ensure that policy and its implementation can keep pace in a co-ordinated way with developments in international peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>On 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1386 under chapter VII of the UN Charter authorising the deployment of an international security assistance force, ISAF, in Afghanistan for six months to assist in the maintenance of security in Kabul and the surrounding areas, so that the Afghan Interim Authority and the personnel of the United Nations can operate in a secure environment. Acting under chapter VII of the UN charter means that the ISAF, whose lead nation is the United Kingdom, is authorised to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate.</P>
    <P>Discussions at the UN Security Council continue to focus on Afghanistan, in particular on the issue of security and the possible extension of ISAF outside Kabul. On 6 February 2002, a full day of meetings on Afghanistan took place, including briefings by both the Secretary General and Special Representative, Ambassador Brahimi. It is not possible at this stage to say exactly how the UN's role in Afghanistan will develop. The question of the possible deployment of Defence Forces personnel to a UN peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan does not arise at this stage.</P>
    <P>There has been no significant EU discussion of participation in the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF. It is understood that all other EU member states intend to contribute to the mission.</P>
    <P>Should Ireland decide to participate in ISAF, Government and Dáil approval would be required and full account would be taken of the security situation in the area, the mandate of the mission and further factors such as the equipment and skills necessary for the mission.</P>

      <P>On 31 July 2000, the United Nations Security Council, under Resolution 1312, established the United Nations mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, <Col N="763" /> UNMEE, consisting of up to 100 military observers and the necessary civilian support staff in anticipation of a peacekeeping operation subject to future authorisation. Under Resolution 1320 of 15 September 2000, the Security Council authorised the deployment within UNMEE of up to 4,200 troops until 15 March 2001. On the latter date, the Security Council, by its Resolution 1344, extended UNMEE's mandate at the previously authorised levels of troops and military observers until 15 September 2001. Resolution 1369 of 14 September 2001 extended the mandate for a further six months until 15 March 2002.</P>
      <P>On 15 June 2001, in the context of the withdrawal of the Irish contingent from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, the UN formally invited Ireland to contribute a guard and administration company to serve with UNMEE at the Force Headquarters in Asmara, Eritrea, with effect from 11 December 2001, for a minimum period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>On 18 July 2001, the Government authorised, subject to the approval of the Dáil, the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE for a period of one year from December 2001. On 26 October 2001, Dáil Éireann approved the despatch of the contingent comprising 209 Defence Forces personnel. An advance party was deployed to the mission area on 26 November 2001. The main body of the contingent deployed on 5 December 2001. The contingent became operational on 11 December 2001.</P>
      <P>In response to separate requests from the UN, 12 members of the Defence Forces were deployed to the mission to take up staff appointments in UNMEE Force HQ in Asmara, Eritrea.</P>
      <P>The role of the Irish contingent, which is based in Asmara, Eritrea, comprises the following: provision of signals technical support to UNMEE HQ; provision of perimeter defence and internal security for UNMEE HQ; provision of security for convoys and escort of key personnel-VIPs; provision of transport services for headquarters staff; provision of tactical mobile command post; manning of military staff message centre; provision of military police for the Irish component, and liaison with force military police unit; and provision of military staff and general administrative support to UNMEE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the deployment of Irish personnel with UNMEE, detailed planning was conducted by the military authorities on all aspects of logistical support for troops serving with UNMEE. The following areas received priority: personal equipment and protection &ndash; this included the deployment of Mowag APCs for force protection; communications &ndash; this included the installation of a VSAT system and the most economic means for troops to contact home at short notice &ndash; call card system for $3 a soldier has 30 minutes call time to Ireland; catering and accommodation facilities &ndash; these are modern and comfortable in UNMEE; detailed medical briefing of troops <Col N="764" /> prior to deployment was undertaken; and each member of the UNMEE contingent was issued with a welfare pack prior to deployment on matters relating to post, travel home and within the mission area, etc.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that Defence Forces headquarters is in daily contact with the mission to assess all aspects of logistical support. On a monthly basis the unit submits to Defence Forces headquarters logistical requirements as determined on the ground which receive immediate attention. The logistical support to Irish personnel serving with UNMEE is founded on the experiences gained by the Defence Forces in Lebanon and the importance attached by my Department to supporting troops overseas. I am satisfied that all appropriate logistical support is available to all members of the Defence Forces serving with UNMEE.</P>

      <P>On 23 April 1996, the Government approved the establishment of a dedicated Garda air support unit, GASU, as recommended in the report of the interdepartmental group on air support for the Garda Síochána. The service provided through the Garda air support unit which was inaugurated in September 1997 comprises Garda Síochána and Air Corps personnel and operates from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. The Garda Síochána is responsible for the operational control and policing functions, while the Air Corps personnel have responsibility for the flying and maintenance functions of the service. Two aircraft are operated by the Air Corps on behalf of the Garda Síochána, one twin engine AS355N Squirrel helicopter and one Defender 4000 fixed wing aircraft. On 10 November 1998, the Government approved the acquisition of a second twin engine helicopter with a 24 hour capability for the GASU. This new helicopter, an EC 135, is due for delivery in the very near future. The Government decided on 20 November 2001 to contract out the piloting and maintenance of the new Garda EC 135 helicopter for a trial period of a least 12 months and the establishment of an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to facilitate, oversee and assess the trial taking into account existing Air Corps services in this area. This committee has met on two occasions since and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is preparing an interim report on matters arising. This decision does not affect the current piloting and maintenance service for existing GASU aircraft which, as stated, is provided at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of night flying training for Air Corps pilots, on 12 May 1999, during an operation in the Clare-Galway region, the Garda Air Support Unit helicopter inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a number of recommendations, one of which was that &ldquo;the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by Air Corps GASU pilots&rdquo;. This recommendation was implemented.</P>

    <P>In order to facilitate an effective programme of training which would not impinge on the ongoing <Col N="766" /> GASU operation, I announced, in February 2000, that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of the GASU. Work began in the Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on 22 May 2000, a request for tender for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355F2 helicopter to the Department of Defence issued.</P>
    <P>The AS 355F2 helicopter was manufactured by Eurocopter in France between 1988 and 1995. As the Department ideally required a helicopter which would be backed up by the manufacturer from the point of view of warranties, maintenance and support, the tender documentation issued only to Eurocopter through its Irish agent, Atron, based in Sandyford, Dublin 18. However, Eurocopter was not able to offer a suitable AS 355F2 helicopter which they could guarantee and support.</P>
    <P>Efforts to acquire on the open market a used AS 355N helicopter, a later model of the F2 also manufactured by Eurocopter, were also not successful. The prospect of obtaining a second hand Squirrel helicopter for this work are not good given the experience in the tender competitions and the buoyancy of the market for such helicopters.</P>
    <P>This matter is the subject of on-going communication between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>St. Bricín's Military Hospital currently provides inpatient accommodation for up to 53 inpatients, a full pharmacy service and a wide range of outpatient services for members of the Defence Forces. Outpatient services provided include primary care services, post hospital reviews, ENT, ophthalmology, psychiatry, physiotherapy, radiology, pathology and dental services, including periodontal treatment. The hospital is not equipped, and would not have the staffing resources, to provide additional more sophisticated services, other than those provided at present.</P>

    <P>There are 53 beds available for immediate use and a further 27 in a reserve ward. The office of the director of Army Medical Corps, storage of Army medical records, base medical stores, the Army pensions board and the Defence Forces printing press are also located in the St. Bricín's Military Hospital complex. The floor area of the <Col N="767" /> hospital and the adjacent laboratory is approximately 5335 square meters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The opportunity to amend the Defence Acts is availed of when legislation sponsored by other Departments and which has a bearing on the Defence Forces is being formulated. This is particularly so in the area of amendments to civil and criminal law relating to the provisions prescribing the punishment for certain civil offences which are also offences against military law as prescribed in the Defence Acts. Generally speaking, the punishments for offences against military law, whether awarded by court martial or otherwise, are in line with punishments prescribed under civil law for similar civil offences.</P>
      <P>For example, civil legislation was amended recently to remove sentences of penal servitude and death from the statute and, at the same time, the Defence Acts were amended under that amending legislation which was sponsored by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to provide for the deletion of sentences of penal servitude and death from the Defence Acts. The most recent amendment of the Defence Act, 1954, which was sponsored by my Department was in 1998. The Defence (Amendment) Act, 1998, provided for the re-organisation of the headquarters of the Defence Forces and for the appointments of deputy chief of staff, operations, and deputy chief of staff, support, and related matters. The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill, 2002, which was published last month and which is sponsored by my Department, contains a proposal to amend section 114 of the Defence Act in relation to redress of wrongs complaints submitted by serving members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that amending the Defence Acts is a continuous and ongoing process in endeavouring to keep them up to date as far as is possible. My Department has prepared a draft restatement of the Defence Acts, 1954-98, which includes the Courts Martial Appeals Act, 1983, and this draft is currently with the Office of the Attorney General. It will not be possible, however, for the Attorney General to certify the restatement until the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill is enacted later this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 90 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999, urgent action was taken by my Department on the implementation of the recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations was that an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps should be commissioned. This was done and I received the final report of the consultants involved in July 2001. This report was examined by both my Department and the military authorities, following which the Air Corps were tasked to take immediate steps towards implementing the recommendations. This they did as a matter of urgency. To further advance the implementation of the recommendations of the safety audit, a working group was established comprising members of the Defence Forces and an official of my Department to oversee the consideration and implementation of the safety issues addressed in the safety audit. This working group has met on a number of occasions and significant progress is being made in this regard.</P>
      <P>Following the accident at Tramore, in addition to the aforementioned investigation by the air accident investigation unit, a military court of inquiry was convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. This court, which is examining the Air Corps safety audit report as part of its proceedings, is still in process and, accordingly, it would not be appropriate to release the report at this time. Neither would it be appropriate to comment on specific aspects of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have previously stated in the House, I take all safety issues very seriously and the safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, at home and overseas, is of para<Col N="769" /> mount importance. I have emphasised to the military authorities that safety standards in equipment, facilities and procedures are of the utmost importance. Funding is not an issue where safety is concerned. Funding is, and will continue to be, available to improve and modernise safety equipment and procedures where necessary.</P>

      <P>The new swimming pool in the Curragh Camp was completed last summer and was officially opened on 17 September 2001. The question of appropriate staffing for the Curragh swimming pool is under review as part of a study of staff allocation in all areas of the Defence Forces training centre.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the above, the pool is currently being used by three schools in the immediate area, during normal working hours. However, it will not be possible to extend the use of the amenity beyond normal working hours until the more general issue of staffing cover is resolved. It would be intended to make the facility available more widely in the event that appropriate lifeguard cover can be secured for additional periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces under the 1996 Defence Forces review implementation plan, I approved a proposal from the military authorities that the military band at the Curragh should be amalgamated with the band of the eastern brigade, the Army No. 1 Band. The amalgamation of these two bands does not involve any reduction in the overall number of musicians within the school of music as already provided for within the Defence Forces review implementation plan approved by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the previous organisation of the Defence Forces, each Army command &ndash; of which there were four, namely, the eastern, Curragh, southern and western commands &ndash; had a <Col N="770" /> military band. In the new organisational structure, these four commands were replaced by three brigades. Each of these three brigades &ndash; eastern, southern and western &ndash; has a band as part of its organisation, with the band of the former Curragh command being now amalgamated with the band of the eastern brigade.</P>
    <P>The current strengths of the various bands continue to reflect the pre-amalgamation structure, pending finalisation of administrative changes arising from the reorganisation. These strengths are as follows: Army No. 1 Band, eastern brigade and including band of former Curragh command &ndash; 55; southern brigade &ndash; 32; western brigade &ndash; 18; HQ administration &ndash; 10; total &ndash; 115.</P>
    <P>The eventual deployment of personnel of the Army school of music as envisaged under the revised structure will be as follows: Army No. 1 Band, eastern brigade and including band of former Curragh command &ndash; 45; southern brigade &ndash; 41; western brigade &ndash; 41; HQ administration &ndash; 9; Total &ndash; 136. The military authorities are of the opinion that this new organisation of the school of music will allow all the Army bands to function to their full potential.</P>
    <P>A competition for the ongoing recruitment of instrumentalists to the Defence Forces school of music was advertised at the end of 2000. Arising from this competition five applicants who were found suitable were enlisted in the Defence Forces on 23 April 2001 of which one was subsequently discharged. A further competition took place in late 2001 and applications from six suitable candidates are being processed at present. Applications are still being accepted for the current competition.</P>

      <Quest>the progress which has been made to date by a person (details supplied) in the examination of the nature and extent of sexual harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces; the progress of other measures to combat sexual harassment and bullying; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces have had formal policies and procedures on sexual harassment and bullying in place since February 1996 and these are outlined in an administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships. Lectures and briefings in this area have continued over the years as an integral element of the training syllabus on recruit, cadet and career courses and, in addition, on those occasions when troops are undergoing training for duty overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2001, the Defence Forces commenced a re-examination of procedures to bring them into line with the best state of the art practice in both the wider public service and in the private sector. The section in the administrative instruction which deals with the procedures concerning allegations <Col N="771" /> of bullying was revised to reflect this. The report of the Government task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, published in March 2001, requires all public and private organisations to reassess their policies. The Defence Forces will actively participate in this review and re-assessment exercise.</P>
    <P>All incidents of sexual harassment brought to the attention of the military authorities are thoroughly investigated. Additional procedures are also being put in place by the Chief of Staff. Each barracks will have a female liaison officer, known and available to all females in barracks. Each formation commander will arrange women's days on a periodic basis to cover issues such as interpersonal relationships and women's health issues.</P>
    <P>An internal information campaign of posters and a simplified user friendly booklet will convey the essential message of the administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships. Briefings and open discussions with mixed gender attendance are to be conducted by formation commanders and will continue on a periodic basis. The military authorities are emphasising again the serious nature of this subject for all personnel. The importance of establishing the proper environment cannot be over emphasised. The Chief of Staff has stated that commanders at all levels should bear in mind that it is a command responsibility to ensure that the military environment is free from any form of sexual harassment and bullying. He has further stated that any failure by a commander to ensure that such is the case or to deal adequately with complaints of sexual harassment or bullying would be considered a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>The Chief of Staff has established a special military steering group to examine these issues. I invited Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, to join the group as an expert civilian chairperson. Her task is to determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces, to <Col N="772" /> review existing policies and procedures, and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area. She has been joined by two other civilian experts, who previously worked with her on the original Government task force, and by senior military personnel, including the Deputy Chief of Staff, support, and a senior female Army officer.</P>
    <P>Approximately 10% of the Defence Forces have been surveyed to determine the nature and the extent of harassment, sexual harassment and bullying and the responses are now being analysed. Dr. Doyle and the joint civilian-military group will now proceed to produce a report by next March. The Defence Forces fully recognise that the singular nature of the military environment does not give anyone a general licence for bullying or harassment of any kind. Such behaviour will not be tolerated.</P>

      <P>The Reserve Defence Force is regarded as a valuable resource to augment the Permanent Defence Force in the exercise of their roles. In reply to a previous question to the House on 4 December 2001, I outlined, in full, the developments relating to the Reserve Defence Force and the work of the Reserve Defence Forces review implementation board.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September an urgent review of capacities and procedures to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities and this review is ongoing. It includes, <i>inter alia</i>, an up-date of the threat assessment; contact with other State agencies was renewed or undertaken. Operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army Ranger Wing, and so forth, were reassessed. Guidance documents pertaining to aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authorities were reassessed. Ordnance and engineer assets in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search were reassessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with the varying nuclear, biological and chemical threats identified from time to time. A programme for the purchase of nuclear, biological and chemical equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased to meet the changing requirements. The Defence Forces hold a range of mod<Col N="774" /> ern NBC equipment including a total of approximately 3,800 NBC suits. A further delivery of 2,000 NBC suits is due in April 2002.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are approximately 13,500 respirators available to the Defence Forces at present. They also have 50 of the most technologically up to date chemical gas monitors and Defence Forces personnel are currently being trained on these. There is an on-going programme of training for personnel as NBC instructors. Some 38 personnel recently successfully completed such courses of instruction. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Defence Forces. The Reserve Defence Force provides a radiological monitoring service at 32 locations throughout the country. This service has been provided as part of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents since 1987.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have responded to 123 separate suspect biological incidents since the events of 11 September last. An operational plan incorporating chemical and biological protocols was issued by the military authorities on 2 November to all relevant military personnel and accordingly, the Defence Forces are in a position to respond to all such requests when requested to do so by the Garda authorities. This service is available on a 24 hour basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service is the State's principal seagoing agency and is tasked with a variety of defence and other roles. It is equipped with a total of eight vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, five off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. Among this complement of vessels is the <i>LE Roisín</i>, which was commissioned into the Naval Service in December, 1999 and the <i>LE Niamh</i>, which was commissioned in September 2001. Both ships were built by Appledore Shipbuilders Limited in England and their modern, state of the art, design and fit are proving a tremendous asset to the Naval Service in carrying out their roles.</P>
      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone. Fishery protection activity accounts for over 90% of all Naval Service patrol time. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, with the addition of <i>LE Roisín</i> and <i>LE Niamh</i> during the lifetime of this Government, the existing resources enable the Naval Service to respond very effectively to the above taskings.</P>

      <P>Air Corps cadets undergo six months basic military orientation in the Cadet School before reporting to the Air Corps to commence flying training and to complete officer training. The duration of the flying training course is approximately eighteen months and progresses from elementary and basic to advanced flying training. Cadets who suc<Col N="776" /> cessfully complete their training are conferred with &ldquo;wings&rdquo; and commissioned as second-lieutenants in the Air Corps. All flying training for cadets is conducted at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</P>
      <P>The military authorities advise that there are currently no plans to change the system whereby personnel are recruited for training as Air Corps pilot officers through the annual Defence Forces cadetship competition, as the cadetship competition is capable of satisfying foreseeable future Air Corps intake needs in this regard.</P>
      <P>There are two cadet classes in training in the Air Corps. One class is in the Cadet School, Military College, Defence Forces Training Centre on basic military training and who are due to be commissioned in 2003. The second class are in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel undergoing flight training and are due to be commissioned this year. The cadetship competition for 2002 was recently advertised and 10 of these cadetships will be for Air Corps pilot cadets.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain essential services currently provided by participants on community employment are being mainstreamed. The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way provides for additional funding of &euro;58,407,951 to transfer to the Department of Education and Science, on a phased basis, by 2003. The availability of this funding has enabled that Department to put in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation on CE is usually for a period of one to three years and all school based participants are being facilitated to complete their full engagement in their school project. FÁS employment services are available to assist participants who have completed their term on CE to look for employment in the open labour market, or to advise on other options such as further education <Col N="777" /> or training opportunities, which may be available locally. The provision of additional services in schools following the mainstreaming of CE services in schools is a matter for the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme, CE, is to operate as a labour market intervention measure targeted at the long-term unemployed. Participants generally are required to be over 25 years of age, be unemployed for one year or more and be in receipt of an appropriate social welfare payment over that period.</P>
      <P>FÁS has provision for 920 CE places in County Kildare for 2002. The allocation of individual places and the renewal of projects is an operational matter for FÁS, and is based on the services being provided, for example, drugs task force projects and personal assistant services for persons with disabilities, and the level of unemployment in the locality.</P>
      <P>The dramatic reduction in the levels of long-term unemployment in recent years has resulted in the pool of potential CE workers diminishing, and as a result many CE sponsors now have difficulty in finding eligible unemployed people. Where sponsors are experiencing difficulties in recruiting people, FÁS and the local employment services office will make every effort to fill vacancies with eligible candidates.</P>
      <P>Participation on CE is normally for a period of one to a maximum of three years as the primary objective of the programme is to progress participants to jobs in the open labour market. In August, 2001 I announced new flexibility arrangements for the future operation of CE which allows FÁS discretion to extend, on a case by case basis, an individual's term on CE, having regard to that individual's personal development needs and future employment prospects. In the case of people aged over 50 years, the three year cap on participation has been removed in cases where people in this age group, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment. For such participants FÁS now has discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001, (No. 45 of 2001), which came into operation on 20 December 2001, implements EU Council Directive 97/81/EC in Irish law.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Act is to provide that a part-time employee, including those employed in the psychiatric services, cannot be treated in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee in relation to conditions of employment; to provide that all employee protection legislation applies to a part-time employee in the manner already applying to a full-time employee; to improve the quality of part-time work; and to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and workers.</P>
      <P>An information booklet on the Act is available on my Department's website www.entemp.ie which sets out in plain language the main provisions of the Act.

      <P>The overall responsibility for marine emergency management has been assigned to the director, Irish Coast Guard IRCG, in accordance with section 4(1)(<i>c</i>), section 4(1)(<i>l</i>), and section 9 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Part of the IRCG responsibility is search and rescue services for persons in distress within the Ireland marine search and rescue region &ndash; IMSRR, inland rivers, lakes and waterways, littoral area and cliffs of Ireland and the off-shore islands.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard has 81 full-time staff and approximately 864 volunteers. It manages and operates three co-ordination-communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 16 remote marine band VHF radio sites and 52 coastal emergency response stations. The Coast Guard has between seven and nine co-ordination staff on duty at any one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" />The Coast Guard has two medium load-carrying marine emergency helicopters, one based at Dublin Airport and the other is based at Shannon Airport. These all weather helicopters are available for marine emergency response on a 24 hour, 365 day basis. It is planned that a third Coast Guard medium load-carrying marine emergency helicopter will be based at Waterford Airport from 1 May 2002 replacing the Air Corps inshore helicopter. Initially the service will be restricted to 12 hours per day. However, from 1 July a full 24 hour service will commence.</P>
    <P>In addition to its own resources the Coast Guard has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour, 365 day basis. These include an Air Corps light load-carrying helicopter based at Finner Army Camp, County Donegal, and an Air Corps daylight only inshore helicopter based at Waterford Airport. The RNLI has 31 lifeboat stations, the Coast Guard has 14 boat stations and the Community Inshore Rescue Service (CIRS) has nine boat stations around the coast.</P>
    <P>Marine emergency helicopters are retained in a state of readiness of not more than 15 minutes from 7.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. and not more than 45 minutes outside of these times 24 hour per day. Marine emergency helicopters are positioned so that: they can reach, by day, 40 nautical miles off-shore in one hour, and they can reach, by night or in bad weather, 100 nautical miles in two hours.</P>
    <P>The RNLI lifeboats provide cover out to 50 nautical miles off the coast. In fair weather lifeboats can reach virtually any point out to 50 nautical miles from the coast in two and a half hours. The average launch time for an all-weather lifeboat is 12.35 minutes and for an inshore lifeboat is 7.47 minutes. The CIRS rescue boats provide cover to 3-5 nautical miles. The average launch time is 10-15 minutes.</P>
    <P>The Coast Guard can also call on Naval Service vessels and divers, Air Corps fixed-wing aircraft, the Gardaí and its divers and the UK Coastguard and all vessels at sea to assist them in their response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 to 108, inclusive, and 113 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to a sustainable commercial salmon fishery based on quality and value rather than volume. Taking all factors into account, however, it remains my firm policy objective to reduce the commercial salmon catch while enhancing the price dividend for fishermen through quality and marketing strategies.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute has been intensively working on the latest stock assessment data for the fishery districts. The detailed analysis and advice has been presented to my Department and the National Salmon Commission. It is clear from the scientific advice that reductions in overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks on a district basis.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the introduction of quotas for the taking of salmon by commercial fishing engines on a fishery district basis. The quota system will come into operation for the 2002 and later fishing seasons.</P>
      <P>I have requested the National Salmon Commission to respond to me on the overall shape of this scheme and I have also mandated the chief executives of the regional fisheries boards to finalise the detailed practical arrangements for its operation through the licence and tagging regime as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of district quotas to reduce the level of commercial catch this year will not be accompanied by compensation. I have <Col N="782" /> spelled out my reservations about national buy-out as a cost efficient workable instrument. It is clear that buy-out is most attractive to those who take few salmon. It is not an effective means of achieving our shared objective of a restoration of salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am ruling out buy-outs as the way forward. Focus on this issue has been an unhelpful distraction and the raising of expectations about bonanzas has not served the interests of the sector or indeed the resource. The introduction of quota to achieve catch reductions is in my view the best instrument available to achieve the agreed objective for salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>I will continue to support, subject to available Exchequer funding, local catchment based setaside proposals with matching funding. In other words, the only context for incentivisation schemes will still be through an agreed local scheme involving commercial fishermen and all other stakeholders who stand to benefit from increased escapement. I have urged local groups and the regional fisheries boards to develop proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past ten years Ireland has achieved rapid and unprecedented economic growth. Tourism has played a key part in this success story and is now one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy. As one of Ireland's major indigenous industries, tourism provides a significant opportunity for the people to develop sustainable businesses based on our greatest natural asset, our marine environment.</P>
      <P>The importance of the marine tourism sector has been recognised by the Government through its allocation of &euro;25 million for the marine leisure tourism sector under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Under the plan, my Department has been charged with developing and putting in place a cohesive and administratively efficient marine tourism grant scheme to support a range of quality and broad based projects. The objective of the scheme is to support the development of the marine tourism sector by improving quality and capacity in a sustainable way. Specific targets are access infrastructure, such as marinas, berths and slipways, and integrated development and co-operative partnerships, particularly in relation to networks and clusters. The scheme, which I recently launched, will be part of the two regional operational programmes and will see the BMW region benefit from an &euro;18 million investment while the south and east region will see a total investment of just under &euro;8 million.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of this scheme, my Department provided funding of &euro;5.71 million for four flagship marina projects at Caherciveen, Kenmare, Roundstone and Rosses Point. I have also in recent months established new and innovative pilot projects to promote marine tourism in two specific areas, Ceanntar na nOileán, County Galway, and the Mullet Peninsula in County Mayo, where there is little investment and limited employment opportunities at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the safety side, my Department has in recent years taken action on a range of issues to <Col N="785" /> improve safety for those who work at sea or engage in water-based leisure activities. On 1 July 2001 I introduced new regulations governing the safe use of personal watercraft, jet skis, fast power craft and other mechanically propelled pleasure craft. These are an initial phase of regulations which have been developed by my Department as a result of the recommendations made in the recent report of the ministerial action group on small powered recreational craft. Specifically, the new regulations now implement the recommendations which had been made in relation to the wearing of appropriate lifejackets, the minimum age under which persons should not be allowed to operate personal watercraft and fast power craft, and the need to view this in the context of an overall appreciation of water safety. In addition, the regulations provide that persons who operate personal watercraft, jet skis, and fast power craft in a dangerous or careless manner can be prosecuted for such behaviour.</P>
    <P>My Department has also, through the Adventure Activities Standards Authority Act, 2001, established a clear and effective statutory framework to promote and enhance the safety of all persons who engage in adventure activities at adventure centres in Ireland. The key provision of the Act is the establishment of an independent standards authority to regulate the safety of adventure activity centres and providers. In so far as commercial fishermen are concerned, it is assumed the Deputy is referring to the sea fisheries sector. I assure the Deputy that I continue to seek to enhance at all appropriate fora the fishing opportunities available to fishermen.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the new approach adopted by Denmark in its aid programme in cutting aid to such countries as Zimbabwe and Malawi due to the fact they do not wish to prop up dictators; and if such thinking will inform decisions in relation to Irish aid in the future.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the decisions made by Denmark referred to by the Deputy and of the fact that, for reasons to do with current economic pressures, there have been cuts in all areas of Danish Government expenditure, including development assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the thinking which lies behind these decisions is already part of the Government's own approach. Acceptable standards of governance are essential for the success of a programme of assistance to developing countries. While governance is a developing issue, Irish involvement in the form of a bilateral aid programme will be contemplated only if a country demon<Col N="786" /> strates a clear commitment to democratic values, to the building of transparent and responsible governmental institutions and to the protection of human rights. A clear commitment on the part of the country concerned to poverty reduction is also required. The trend of its policies must be towards the improvement of its governance and increased respect for human rights. Countries which do not satisfy these and other essential conditions will not be assisted at the government to government level. If the quality of governance in a country which we are supporting with a bilateral programme falls below required thresholds, we are ready to terminate the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is continuing. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies, including the Defence Forces, can react quickly <Col N="787" /> and efficiently to any large-scale emergency and that the necessary supports are in place to do so. The Defence Forces are prepared to aid the civil authorities when called upon for assistance in the event of a major emergency. This role is essentially a supporting role to the primary agencies, that is, the Garda Síochána, local authorities, including fire authorities, and the health services.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces maintain liaison with each of these authorities in relation to providing such support as deemed appropriate to the particular emergency. In addition, the Defence Forces maintain disaster stores throughout the country specifically for this eventuality. These contain a range of equipment, such as protective clothing, small plant, tools, sandbags, emergency lighting and generators. The Defence Forces resources, such as transport, heavy plant, communications equipment, ambulances, small rescue craft and limited air support can, subject to availability, be provided in support to the civil authority concerned.</P>
      <P>The numbers of personnel to be provided for these circumstances is determined by the nature of the request received from the responsible authority and the availability of personnel at any given time. When circumstances allow for some degree of warning, such as imminent severe weather, etc., personnel are placed on standby in keeping with the envisaged tasks requested by the relevant authorities. The review of existing emergency plans has been conducted in the light of current developments and initial review shows that there are sound arrangements within the relevant Government Departments and agencies, including the Defence Forces, for dealing with emergency issues.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with the varying nuclear, biological and chemical threats identified from time to time. A programme for the purchase of nuclear, biological and chemical, NBC, equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased to meet the changing requirements. The Defence Forces hold a range of modern NBC equipment, including a total of approximately 3,800 nuclear, biological and chemical, NBC, suits. A further delivery of 2,000 NBC suits is due in April 2002. In addition, there are approximately 13,500 respirators available to the Defence Forces at present. They also have 50 of the most technologically up-to-date chemical gas monitors and Defence Forces personnel are currently being trained in their use. There is an ongoing programme of training for personnel as NBC instructors. Some 38 personnel recently successfully completed such courses of instruction. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Reserve Defence Force provides a radiological monitoring service at 32 locations throughout the country. This service has been provided <Col N="788" /> as part of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents since 1987. The Defence Forces have responded to 123 separate suspect biological incidents since the events of 11 September last. An operational plan incorporating chemical and biological protocols was issued by the military authorities on 2 November to all relevant military personnel and, accordingly, the Defence Forces are in a position to respond to all such requests when requested to do so by the Garda authorities. This service is available on a 24 hour basis.</P>

    <P>The length of attachments to the Naval Service of these personnel vary, but most have been attached for lengthy periods. In accordance with Defence Force regulations, all attachments are under the command of the Naval Service. The future of these personnel is being dealt with in the context of the reorganisation of the Naval Service. Those for whom a suitable vacancy exists will be invited to apply for transfer into the Naval Service. As this involves a transfer from one service/corps to another, the provisions of section 61(2) of the Defence Act applies, that is, transfer <Col N="789" /> can only take place if the person concerned consents to such transfer.</P>
    <P>The methodology for dealing with this issue was a matter for discussion between all interested parties, including the representative associations during 2001. As a result of these discussions, the deputy chief of staff, support, issued a letter of instruction entitled Reorganisation of the Naval Service, Service Support Corps Arrangements, which lays down the principles and procedures to deal with the relationship between the various Army service support corps and the Naval Service and the future of the personnel of these corps current serving attached to the Naval Service. It is expected that these personnel will apply for transfer to the Naval Service and will be assigned to appointments with the Naval Service by the assignment board which has recently been set up to deal with such matters. The facilities which are available to Naval Service personnel at Haulbowline are also available to these Army personnel.</P>
    <P>Army personnel can only apply for Army promotional competitions. However, if these personnel transfer to the Naval Service, they will then become eligible to apply for Naval Service promotional competitions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 the Government moved quickly and decisively to respond to the evolving international situation. In replies to previous questions to the House on 4 December 2001, I outlined details in relation to the establishment of the Government task force on emergency planning and the office of emergency planning.</P>
      <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is continuing. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency. As chairman of the task force, I intend that such responses would be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.</P>
      <P>The task force has been meeting regularly to review the various emergency planning and response issues. The role of this task force is to ensure a co-ordinated and an effective response to large scale emergencies. I am pleased to report to this House that there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and agencies through the task force on emergency planning, the office of emergency planning and the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning.</P>
      <P>The office of emergency planning provides a key support to the task force and co-ordinates the work of the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning to meet the new threats arising from international terrorism. The existing lead role of Departments and agencies in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will, of course, continue.</P>
      <P>The review of existing emergency plans has been conducted in light of current developments and initial review shows that there are sound arrangements within the relevant Departments and agencies for dealing with emergency issues. The technical expertise and emergency planning skills that are required are available but there is a need to further the training and development of expertise in this important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" />Arrangements are in place in the various emergency plans for their activation. The resources of the State are grouped under the various national planning arrangements, directed by the relevant Departments and agencies. Each Department and agency maintains the necessary equipment, facilities and systems to provide an efficient organisation that can make the appropriate responses in quite different situations, ranging from daily bluelight emergency responses to 999 calls, to those major emergencies involving a much more detailed response and possibly the activation of major emergency plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's approach to participation in PfP was set out in our presentation document of 1 December 1999, which outlined our five priority areas of participation as: co-operation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment; and, co-operation in marine matters.</P>
      <P>Ireland's first individual partnership programme, IPP, covered the period up to 31 December 2001 and included some 89 activities, consisting mainly of training courses, seminars, conferences and table top exercises.</P>
      <P>Ireland's second IPP, covering the period 2002-2003 has been drawn up on the basis of experience gained with the initial IPP and it continues to give practical content to the overall priorities identified in the Presentation Document. This second IPP contains a total of 125 activities to be undertaken by the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, civil staffs from the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Participation in PfP activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation and therefore has no bearing on Ireland's commitment to the EU headline goal.</P>
      <P>In accordance with this fundamental principle, all decisions regarding the content and form of the IPP for 2002-2003 have been made by the Irish authorities. The details of the IPP activities for 2002-2003 will shortly be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" />Ireland joined PfP's planning and review process, PARP, in 2001 with a view to enhancing interoperability with our PfP partners in such areas as tactics, operational cohesion, logistics and language training in support of peace support operations generally, and also in relation to planning for the EU headline goal.</P>
    <P>The training opportunities provided by Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace will further enhance the development of the Defence Forces consistent with the objectives of the Government White Paper on Defence published in February, 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 to 136, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence published in February 2000 set out the overall strategic direction <Col N="793" /> for the development and management of Defence policy for the ten years to 2010. The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. In addition the chief of staff has discretion to have 250 recruits in training at any given time, over and above this figure of 10,500. This Permanent Defence Force establishment of 10,500 represents an optimal establishment on the basis of current and envisaged roles and taskings and the assessment of the contemporary security environment. The strengths including cadets and recruits, on 31 December, 2001 of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps respectively were 8,812, 951 and 912.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces in the year 2002 to fill vacancies as required. I launched the Defence Forces 2002 general service recruiting campaign yesterday and this will be followed by national and local media advertising.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces plan to spend &euro;41.9 million on defensive equipment in 2002. The major acquisitions planned relate to the following procurement programmes: completion of delivery of 40 armoured personnel carriers, APCs; initial procurement of 60 mm mortar; initial procurement of a medium range anti-armour guided weapon; delivery of battlefield surveillance equipment consisting of thermal imagers and ground surveillance radar; delivery of NBC detection, protective and decontamination equipment and ammunition purchases for training purposes and maintenance of minimum operational stock levels.</P>
    <P>In addition to these programmes the Defence Forces is considering the acquisition of an artillery weapon locating system for use in peacekeeping operations.</P>

      <P>The person named included a parcel on his 2001 area aid application on which an over-claim was determined. The applicant applied for a total of 23.71 hectares. The area determined was 22.01 hectares. This represents a difference of 1.7 hectares or 7.7 %. Under EU Regulation (EC) No. 2419/2001, the penalty is double the difference when the difference between the area claimed and the area found is between 3% and 20%. Therefore in this case a penalty of 3.4 hectares has to apply leaving the area determined for payment purposes at 20.31 hectares. Payment due under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme, suckler cow premium scheme and special beef premium scheme will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>The 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming included a requirement for the farmer taking over a holding to enlarge it and to farm the enlarged holding for the full period of the pension. Some transferees enlarged the holdings by leasing additional land for less than the full period of the pension and representations have been made to my Department that a number of these transferees are having difficulty in renewing these leases or finding alternative land. I have undertaken to raise the issue with the EU Commission, but the possibility of a change in the rules is very limited since the enlargement requirement is a provision of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2079/92, which governs the 1994 scheme. There is no enlargement requirement in the new scheme of early retirement from farming which was introduced in November 2000 and, indeed, I had raised the problems which the enlargement provision gave rise to on a number of occasions with the Commissioner. There is a viability criterion instead in the new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals at either national or EU level to bring the milk quota year in line with the calendar year. The milk quota review group, which is made up of representatives of the farming organisations, the dairy industry and technical advisers, has in the past reviewed all aspects of the operation of the quota regime in Ireland, but no recommendation has been made by the group to seek a change in the current quota year. The group considered the current quota year &ndash; 1 April to 31 March &ndash; to have certain advantages over a system based on the calendar year. Among these advantages are the following: since the volume of milk deliveries rises towards the end of the current quota year, a small percentage adjustment can have a significant effect in helping producers to remain within their quotas. The opposite is the case for 1 January-31 December quota year; there are many more calves born in February and March than in the autumn or winter, giving a good opportunity to dispose of surplus milk as feed; farmers trying to reduce deliveries towards the end of the calendar year would be more likely to dispose of surplus cows as cull cows, while in the current regime they are more likely to calve down in spring. A change could therefore have a negative impact on the beef sector; and fresh liquid milk required during the winter period could be adversely affected by a change in quota year.</P>

      <P>Following legal advice from the Attorney General, I revoked the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996 (S.I. No. 152 of 1996), which set out criteria and procedures for granting community pharmacy contracts. The effect of the revocation, for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts, is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapse with the regulations. Those concerned should contact the health board directly concerning re-applying.</P>
      <P>The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the Planning Act. The pharmacy review group, established by my Department to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland, is now being asked to report as quickly as possible, given the new circumstances. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports.</P>

There are no plans to amend the scheme to include Crohn's disease, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>

      <Col N="804" />Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme.

      <P>The Adoption Board is an independent statutory body with responsibility for the administration of the Adoption Acts, 1952-1998. The Deputy will appreciate that I am therefore not in a position to comment on specific cases. I have been advised by the Adoption Board that the approval to adopt abroad, i.e. the declarations of eligibility and suitability which are issued by the board are not country specific and do not lay down any restrictions in relation to the age of the child who may be adopted. However inter-country assessment reports usually include a recommendation with regard to the age of a child which prospective adopters would have the capacity to parent. These reports are sent with the declarations of eligibility and suitability and are used by the authorities in sending countries when matching a child with prospective adopters to ensure the best interests of the child are met. Questions concerning the adoption laws of the United Kingdom should be addressed to the appropriate Government authority there with responsibility for this area, which I understand is the Department of Health in most instances. Should the Deputy require any further assistance in this regard, I am sure the Adoption Board would be happy to help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The main features of the five years covered by the report Cancer in Ireland 1994-1998 can be summarised as follows. Almost 20,000 new cases of cancer and 7,500 cancer deaths occurred every year; the commonest cancers were those of skin, large bowel, lung, breast &ndash; in women &ndash; and <Col N="806" /> prostate &ndash; in men; overall, men and women had similar risks of developing cancer; between 1994 and 1998 there was no significant change in the risk of developing or dying from cancer; cancer incidence in Ireland was quite similar to that in neighbouring countries; and the majority of patients had their cancers removed surgically and overall survival from cancer was 43% and was generally better for women.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy has already been advised by the National Cancer Registry Board, on foot of parliamentary questions he asked on 28 February 2001, that there is not enough data to make meaningful comparisons on a county by county basis. The National Cancer Registry gives a detailed breakdown of all incident cases of the various forms of cancer in appendix 5 of its report. Given the amount of information that this covers, I am arranging that a copy of the report be furnished to the Deputy under separate cover.</P>
      <P>Overall, and for most common cancers, cancer rates in Ireland for the five years covered by the report were lower than in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, higher than in England and close to EU averages. Exceptions were breast cancer, where our risk was lower than that of the neighbouring countries and lung cancer in women, for which our risk was well above EU average. As the Deputy has already been advised on 4 April 2001, comparisons with US data are less reliable than with European figures because of the limited coverage of cancer registration in the US until recently. I have also been advised by the National Cancer Registry Board that cancer registration in Japan only covers a minority of the population and as such cannot be used as a reliable comparison.</P>

      <P>Three proposals from Kilkenny County Council for the provision of new fire stations at Freshford, Callan and Castlecomer are under consideration in my Department. The Freshford and Callan proposals are at contract document stage and Castlecomer is at approval-in-principle stage. Many applications for funding for the provision of fire stations, fire appliances, the computer aided mobilisation project and emergency or rescue equipment have been received in my Department and these will be considered in the context of the 2002 fire services capital programme, which I expect to announce shortly. I have provided a record level of funding of &euro;19.568 million for the programme this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" />In accordance with Government policy and EU requirements on the application of the polluter pays principle to water services provision, local authorities are required to recover from all non-domestic users the operational and marginal capital costs of providing such users with water and waste water services. The method by which water services infrastructure is procured has no direct relevance to this policy other than that innovative procurement options such as by way of public private partnerships may be expected to generate efficiencies which may result in lower end user charges than would otherwise apply. Where local authority water services costs are recovered directly from non-domestic end users, this should be reflected in an appropriate adjustment to the commercial rate.</P>

The report concluded that this form of procurement would provide the most favourable solution in terms of cost, performance, time and risk.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of options are available to assist lower income households and elderly persons especially to secure necessary improvement works to their houses, including the provision of <Col N="809" /> heating systems. These include the task force on special housing aid for the elderly, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes, the local authority house improvement loan scheme and the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme.</P>
      <P>The task force on special housing aid for the elderly provides funding to the health boards to undertake necessary basic repairs and improvements to the houses of elderly persons. In the interests of elderly persons, the scheme has, since its inception, sought to minimise formal procedural and other requirements. Works are, in appropriate circumstances, carried out at no cost to the applicant. The terms of the scheme were extended last year to include, where appropriate, the provision of heating systems. I have allocated funding of &euro;11.903 million to the task force in 2002.</P>
      <P>I have also introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes since coming into office. The effective maximum grant available under the disabled persons grant scheme was increased from &euro;10,158 to &euro;20,320 with the grant covering up to 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds previously. In addition, I have increased the maximum grant available under the essential repairs grant from &euro;2,285 to &euro;9,530. These improvements have allowed local authorities and health boards to extend the type of work that can be undertaken in individual cases, including the provision of heating systems.</P>
      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of existing local authority dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. However, where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated estates, the installation of central heating in dwellings may form part of the works undertaken. In addition to the funding available under the remedial works scheme, local authorities may seek my Department's approval to the use of their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of their local authority housing programme and remedial works scheme for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings. A number of local authorities have used and continue to use this approach to provide central heating in their rented dwellings.</P>

      <P>Preliminary proposals for this scheme were submitted to my Department by the local authority in February 1991 but have not been approved. The scheme was included as a 2004-05 objective in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme for 2000-02, announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it has not been possible to include the scheme in the programme. A revised <Col N="811" /> proposal has recently been submitted to my Department by the council. This will be considered in the context of the next phase of the water service investment programme in light of the prevailing priorities identified by the council at that time.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, provides for the continued payment of child benefit up to age 19 years in respect of children aged 16 or over who are still receiving full-time education. The circumstances which determine whether a child may be regarded as receiving full-time education are specified in regulation. These regulations stipulate that a child attending a course of instruction by day on a full-time basis at an institution of education may be regarded as receiving full-time education.</P>
      <P>In the case of children who are being educated at home, the legislative requirement in regard to receiving full-time education can be fulfilled by the provision of confirmation from the Department of Education and Science that the child has registered and been accepted to sit State examinations, including the junior certificate or leaving certificate examination. This, together with a declaration from the parent that his or her child is receiving full-time education from a suitably qualified person, would suffice to allow the payment of child benefit in the case of a child being educated at home. In reaching a determination on this matter, each case is decided on its own merits.</P>
      <P>The legislative requirement in regard to receiving full-time education applies equally where a child is attending an institution of education or being educated at home. Some 137,612 children aged 16 or over receive child benefit. There are no data on the number of children in this age group being educated at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of the immigration registration office in Harcourt Square has already been the subject of a review by the Garda commissioner in consultation with officials from the immigration and citizenship division of my Department with a view to responding to the dramatic and unprecedented increase in the number of non-nationals seeking to register or renew their permission to remain. The extent of that increase is illustrated by the figures for persons processed at that office in the years 2000 and 2001 &ndash; 26,641 and 56,510 respectively. Initiatives already undertaken include: very significant additional resources; longer opening hours; computerisation of the registration process, and; streamlining of operating procedures.</P>
      <P>The streamlining of operating procedures includes less frequent attendance by certain spouses of Irish nationals for the purpose of registration or permission to remain in the State. In many cases such persons are now only required to register or renew their permission to remain every five years. It should be borne in mind however that a non-EEA national does not enjoy an automatic entitlement to reside in the State simply by virtue of his or her marriage to an Irish national. Different considerations may apply for example where such a non-EEA national entered Ireland illegally, overstayed his or her original permission to enter the State or has been involved in criminal activity.</P>
      <P>Further additional resources are currently being deployed to the immigration registration office in Harcourt Square and negotiations are taking place with the relevant trade union representatives with a view to introducing a shift system for civilian staff. This will facilitate a further extension of opening hours and will eliminate the need for queuing at the immigration registration office.</P>
      <P>Work is already underway in relation to further initiatives. The Office of Public Works has purchased new and far larger accommodation for the registration office, which will be ready for occupation later this year. The intention is that the new accommodation will provide a one stop shop for legally resident non nationals in the Dublin area as it will also accommodate the immigration and citizenship division of my Department together with the visa office in the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is intended that this initiative will further facilitate the streamlining of operating procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" />It should also be borne in mind that, as a result of the introduction of computerisation, customers attending the immigration registration office get a better quality service at the counter. Under the old system, the manually prepared Garda registration certificate was posted out to the person in question several weeks after his or her visit to the Harcourt Square office. The position now is that the new computer generated certificate is handed to the customer on the date of his or her visit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has agreed to a set of proposals which provides for the making of a contribution of &euro;128 million by religious congregations to the scheme of compensation for people who suffered abuse while in institutional care. The agreement with the congregations has come after a lengthy period of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussions on this issue opened over a year ago the congregations stated that they wished to make a meaningful contribution to any scheme of redress for people who spent large parts of their childhood in institutional care. The <Col N="818" /> terms that have now been agreed represent a reasonable outcome, which will allow all relevant parts of Irish society to make meaningful redress for past wrongs through which children were injured.</P>
    <P>The terms of the agreement include: a cash payment of &euro;38 million, of which &euro;12.7 million will be placed in an education trust for former residents of the institutions and their families; property transfers totalling &euro;80 million. This amount will include property transfers which have been, or are being, made since the Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, made an apology in May 1999 to victims of institutional child abuse, with further transfers up to the total amount taking place within the next three to five years; &euro;10 million in counselling, record retrieval and pastoral services for people in need; the religious congregations have stated that they will also continue their co-operation with State and voluntary bodies in relation to property transfers for services to people in need.</P>
    <P>The agreement with the congregations is at present an outline agreement in principle and will require further discussion to finalise all the issues, including the exact terms of the indemnity which will be given to the participating congregations. While the precise form and extent of the indemnity is still to be finalised it will cover all claims in respect of which an award is made by the Residential Institutions Redress Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department makes a grant available to each local authority on an annual basis to enable local authority librarians select, purchase, and deliver books to the primary schools. The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each local authority area. The total value of the grant in 2001 was approximately &euro;1.32 million. It is a matter, for each local authority as to whether it provides a mobile library service for the schools in its area. My Department has no involvement in the operation or financing of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In implementation of Branching Out, the comprehensive review of public library policy that was published in October 1998, a working group was established in May 2000 to explore all of the issues relating to the schools library service. My Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, An Comhairle Leabhar<Col N="819" /> lanna and the library authorities are represented on the group. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to proper library facilities and resources. In this regard, in addition to the funding that my Department provides to local authorities on an annual basis, two grants have issued in recent years from my Department directly to primary and post primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received £3,170 each. The grant that issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to £2,500, while disadvantaged schools received £5,320.</P>

    <P>A detailed breakdown of the funding provided to individual local authorities during the years 1998-<Col N="820" /> 2001 is being compiled within my Department and will be sent to the Deputy shortly. It is a matter, however, for each local authority to provide a library service for the schools in its area. My Department has no involvement in the operation of this service.</P>
    <P>In implementation of branching out, the comprehensive review of public library policy that was published in October 1998, a working group was established in May 2000 to explore all of the issues relating to the schools library service. My Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, An Comhairle Leabharlanna and the library authorities are represented on the group. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to proper library facilities and resources. In this regard, in addition to the funding that my Department provides to local authorities on an annual basis, two grants have issued in recent years from my Department directly to primary and post-primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of approximately &euro;1,269 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received &euro;4,025 each. The grant that issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to &euro;3,174 while disadvantaged schools received &euro;6,755.</P>
    <P>A second grant issued to all primary and post-primary schools in December 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant primary schools received a payment of &euro;9.78 per pupil, while a minimum grant of &euro;586.62 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or less. Post-primary schools also received &euro;9.78 per pupil, while a minimum grant of &euro;1955.40 was paid to all schools with less than 200 recognised pupils. At primary level the total value of these two grants was approximately &euro;9.78 million, while at second level the two grants amounted to &euro;6.60 million.</P>

      <P>The role of a single manager is analogous to that of a board of management in that that person is responsible for the direct governance of the school. In the circumstances, the difficulties referred to by the Deputy are essentially issues that need to be resolved at local level. Nevertheless, since his appointment, my officials have maintained close contact with the single manager with a view to providing assistance to him in carrying out his duties. However, in view of ongoing efforts at local level to attempt to resolve this matter, I do not consider that any public comment from me at this stage in relation to this issue would be appropriate.</P>
