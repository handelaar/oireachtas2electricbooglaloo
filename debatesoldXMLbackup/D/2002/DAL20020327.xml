      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to this and the following proposal which is related. We are rushing legislation through the House in a very unwise manner. There is plenty of precedent in this House to show that rushed law is bad law. One has only to think of the rod licence legislation. This is very serious legislation that will affect one category of people and turn them into criminals. They are people who live in temporary dwellings and because we do not make provision for them&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but the two proposals are very closely related. We are proposing to do something in one and use a guillotine in the other.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>The third proposal concerns No. 68, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No 2) Bill, 2001. Is that agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal to guillotine the Report and Final Stages of this Bill is not agreed. The Government is introducing an amendment today which is not an amendment to housing legislation but proposes to amend the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. It was introduced yesterday and is seven pages long. It is, in effect, entirely new legislation which purports to deal with encampments of Travellers, but there has been no consultation with any Traveller organisation or the Government's own committees that deal with Traveller accommodation. It has wider implications for industrial relations, the conduct of industrial disputes, protests and ordinary trespass, which it criminalises for the first time. It is a major change in our law.</P>
      <P>It was circulated yesterday to be debated today in a restricted debate which will be guillotined at 1.30 p.m. and so will not get the attention it deserves. This is part of a series of such legislation from the Government, including a Bill passed last week dealing with mobile phones, that cannot be implemented. Legislation should not be enacted in this way. We oppose the guillotine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the Government in general hope the Campus Stadium Ireland issue will now fade away. Arising from the Attorney General's report into the aquatic centre, which sets out in forensic clarity what happens when the Taoiseach breaks the rules, has the Tánaiste raised with the Taoiseach his breaking of Government and EU procurement rules and even his own Government's published instructions? Is the Tánaiste certain that the current estimate of the cost of the whole stadium Ireland project, which is now double what the Taoiseach said, is the final word, or does she believe that it may go higher? Finally, will she agree that it is time to have a fundamental examination of the whole project on cost grounds alone at a time when public expenditure is galloping ahead at 22%?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, the Taoiseach told the Dáil that Mr. Paddy Teahon was not sacked from his position as chairman and chief executive of <Col N="571" /> Campus and Stadium Ireland Development. In his evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts last night, Mr. Teahon said he received a call from the secretary to the Cabinet who read to him the text of the agreed Government statement announcing his removal from office. Does the Tánaiste accept that does not amount to anything other than sacking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Noonan's query, the Taoiseach was operating on the basis of the same information I and every other member of the Government had, and that was unsatisfactory. Key information was not provided to the Government either in December 2000 or when we put the matter under close scrutiny a few months ago, and I regret that very much. When the Minister, Deputy McDaid, wrote to the chairman of CSID two weeks ago after <i>The Irish Times</i> article, the information on the status of Waterworld UK was not forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Government appointed High Point Rendel to do a cost analysis of the project. That report has now been published. To the best of my memory, it speculates that excluding the cost of the land, which is not inconsiderable, we are talking about something in the order of £700 million. The Government has resolved that that stadium will not proceed at the moment. It will be a matter for the next Government to decide, on the basis of a mandate from the people, its choices and priorities in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Tánaiste has acknowledged that the negligence of the Government was due to the fact that information was withheld from it but I put it to the Tánaiste that the reason information was withheld was because Government instructions were not followed. The memorandum that went to Government was written by Mr. Paddy Teahon. The initials &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;, meaning Campus Stadium Ireland, were at the top of the memorandum so the origin of the memorandum should have been clear to the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the people who were around the table. The memorandum was forwarded for circulation from the Taoiseach's private office, not from the Department of the Taoiseach. The information which was concealed from the Tánaiste and her colleagues was available because it was published in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and if Government instructions and procedures had been followed, the Secretary and officials of the Department of the Taoiseach would have produced the memorandum and provided the information the Tánaiste did not get, whereby she would have been in a position to make a realistic decision. It is not enough for the Tánaiste to say she was misled. She was misled because it suited the Taoiseach's purposes for her to be misled. That is what happened. Not only was the memorandum written by Mr. Paddy Teahon, as chairman of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development, it was presented in Cabinet by Mr. Teahon rather than the Taoiseach. A decision was made on the basis of a memorandum brought in from outside by a former public servant who is now a businessman in the private sector. That is totally in breach <Col N="573" /> of Cabinet instructions and the Tánaiste should be ashamed of herself to have sat there and presided over that with the Taoiseach, but it is principally the Taoiseach who is negligent.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the flawed information, the Government made a decision that a contract to design, build, finance and operate the aquatic centre would be given to Rohcon, Waterworld UK and Dublin Waterworld. After all the brouhaha, does that contract still stand, even though it was given on the basis of incomplete information?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach brought the memorandum to Government under his authority. The memorandum was not proposed by anybody other than a member of the Government, as the Deputy is well aware. It was brought by the Taoiseach in good faith. At no stage, even when this matter was under close scrutiny three or four months ago in December of last year and January of this year, was the Government told the reason UK Waterworld had given away 90% of the contract it had got to operate this facility to Dublin Waterworld, a company that was incorporated after the tender had closed.</P>

In light of the comprehensive rejection of all the information and the data on which this important multi-million pound deal was done, will the Tánaiste accept that the line Minister responsible, in this case the Taoiseach, was absolutely derelict in his duty, if the basis for this important contract was entirely fraudulent, as now seems to be the case and seems to be acknowledged by the answers given by the Tánaiste this morning?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste:</NameTxt>
      <P>The executive services contract is a contract between CSID and the company in question. In the first instance, therefore, it is a matter for CSID to look at that contract. Now that there will be a chief executive, I imagine it would want to review that contract in any event, but even if there were not one, I do not think it is ever satisfactory that somebody should get a percentage of the cost of the project because there is no incentive in that kind of arrangement to minimise costs. It is clearly not a matter for me and it is not a matter for the Government, but it is a matter for the board of CSID. Given that the Government is the only shareholder&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank my colleagues across the floor of the House for their co-operation in the recommittal to Committee Stage of this Bill in respect of this amendment for the purpose of dealing with the very important issue of unauthorised temporary dwellings. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, indicated on Committee Stage that a further Government amendment would be introduced on Report Stage in relation to unauthorised encampments. Having given detailed consideration to the issues involved, the Government has decided that the most appropriate approach is to provide, by way of amendments to <Col N="583" /> this Bill, for the insertion of new provisions in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, to deal with such incidents. Amendment No. 1 relates to the Long Title of the Bill, which is being changed to take account of Report Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and to take account of the withdrawal on Committee Stage of an amendment to the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>Official amendment No. 16 provides for the insertion of a new part in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, to provide for a prohibition on any person's entering and occupying land without the owner's consent where such entry or occupation is likely to damage the land substantially, with associated offences and penalties. The new provisions prohibit any person, without the consent of the owner of the land, to enter or occupy the land or to bring any object onto such land where it is likely to damage the land substantially or prejudicially affect any amenity to do with the land or prevent anyone entitled to use the land or any amenity associated with it from making reasonable use of the land or the amenity or otherwise render the land or amenity or the lawful use of the land or amenity unsanitary or unsafe or substantially interfere with the land or amenity or the lawful use of the land or amenity.</P>
    <P>There is also provision that where a member of the Garda Síochána has reason to believe that a person is committing or has committed an offence under this section, the member may demand of the person his or her name and address and may direct the person to leave the land and to remove any object from the land which is owned or under the control of the person. The member of the Garda Síochána will be required to inform the person of the nature of the offence in which the person is suspected of having been involved and the statutory consequences of failing to comply with a demand or direction.</P>
    <P>It will be an offence, under the new part, for a person to fail to give his or her name and address to a garda or give a false or misleading name or address or fail to comply with a direction from a garda. Provision is also made for a member of An Garda Síochána to arrest, without warrant, a person committing an offence under the new provision. In the event of the owner of a temporary dwelling or other object not removing that object from the land at the request of a garda, the member concerned may remove or cause to be removed the object from the land in question and arrange for its storage. Any object removed by a garda under this provision will be returned to the person claiming it upon his or her making a declaration in writing that he or she is the owner of the object or is authorised by the owner to claim it or is otherwise entitled to claim it for a reason specified by the person.</P>
    <P>At the discretion of the Garda Commissioner, the person claiming possession of the object may be required to pay the amount of any expenditure reasonably incurred in removing and storing the <Col N="584" /> object. The commissioner will be entitled to sell or dispose of an object removed and stored under this provision if it is not claimed and removed within one month of the date on which a notice was served on the owner. The net proceeds of the sale, having deducted the expenditure incurred for its removal, storage and sale, may be returned to the owner. The penalties for a person on summary conviction of offences under this section are a fine of up to &euro;3,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to one month or both.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to accept this amendment which provides an effective mechanism to deal with the type of large-scale unauthorised encampments which have emerged in the past year or two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose these amendments on a number of grounds. I oppose the way they are being introduced and the manner in which it is proposed to rush them through the House today.</P>
      <P>Problems are being encountered, particularly during the summer months, with very large encampments of what are called &ldquo;Traveller traders&rdquo; and the occupation of public spaces, football fields and so on. There are also problems regarding the occupation, in some cases, of private land and payments being demanded before people leave that land. In fairness to everybody concerned, those problems must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises as to whether we should address those problems by way of additional legislation. Many of the difficulties arise because insufficient accommodation has been provided for Travellers. The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, provided for the adoption by local authorities of five year plans to accommodate Travellers within their catchment area. There was such a degree of urgency about that legislation that special provision was made that if elected members of local authorities did not agree, within six months, to the adoption of a Traveller accommodation plan, the plan could be made by the county manager. A plan was, in all cases, made by elected members of local authorities. That legislation was to provide for sufficient Traveller accommodation within a five year timeframe. The Act was passed in 1998. We have now reached the latter end of that timeframe. Of the 2,200 purpose provided Traveller accommodation places on halting sites or group housing schemes, only a little over 100 have been provided to date. The principal problem of illegal or unauthorised Traveller encampments remains due to the provision of insufficient accommodation, notwithstanding the passing of the required legislation and the fact that local authorities adopted the Traveller accommodation plans. That, if anything, should demonstrate the difference between passing legislation, adopting plans on paper and implementing them. We can pass all the legislation we like &ndash; it may look very well politically for the Government sponsoring the legislation &ndash; but how are we to enforce it? <Col N="585" /> Legislation exists to deal with unauthorised encampments but it is not being enforced as will be the case with this legislation. It is sad, at a time when we have the worst housing crisis in the history of this State, that the biggest amendment being made to this legislation deals with unauthorised Traveller encampments.</P>
    <P>Where is the Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal who authored this amendment? Why is he not in the House to take this Bill? Perhaps there is a good reason for his absence but the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, did not inform the House of it. This is the second time in two weeks that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has not turned up in the House to take this Bill for which he is responsible. I would like to hear why he is not present.</P>
    <P>What we have before us is effectively new legislation. Amendment No. 1, which is, purportedly, an amendment to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2001, will amend the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. The amendment runs to seven pages, complete with definitions, offences and so on. It is new legislation and should have been introduced separately. If this amendment is to amend the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2001, it should have been circulated before yesterday. This Bill was published last December. If the Government was so exercised about this issue, it had three months within which to circulate its intention to introduce this amending legislation. It is remarkable and unacceptable that an amendment to introduce a major change in our law as proposed today was not circulated to Members until the eleventh hour. It is also remarkable that this proposal was not considered by the consultative committees set up by this Government to deal with Traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>I would like to read into the record comments made jointly by Pavee Point, the Irish Travellers' Movement and the National Traveller Women's Forum in a document circulated to us today:</P>
    <P>Traveller organisations have worked with the State and other social partners on the monitoring committee for the report of the task force on the Travelling community. As part of this work, and at the request of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a sub-committee was established to look at the issues raised by illegal encampments and the desire by members of the settled community to introduce tougher laws to deal with these issues. This committee met seven times and is scheduled to present its report shortly. Yet the committee itself was not informed of the inclusion of any changes to the '98 Act in the current Bill, while Traveller representatives were not informed and then misinformed of this development.</P>
    <P>I spoke yesterday to representatives of Traveller organisations who told me they had no knowledge this proposal was to be introduced. They were not consulted or informed about it and when they raised questions as to whether some<Col N="586" /> thing like this was contemplated they were, I am told, misinformed. There was no discussion or consultation on this amendment with representative organisations or the national Traveller consultative committee, which met last week and was not informed about it. There was also no consultation with the monitoring group established under the report of the task force on Traveller accommodation, which has met several times.</P>
    <P>Was the Garda consulted about the introduction of this legislation, because the amendment provides for arrest without warrant in certain circumstances? What discussions took place with the Garda about the likely effect of this measure in circumstances where a large number of caravans pull into a public park? Will gardaí be instructed to arrest without warrant everybody in that encampment? What are the implications of that provision?</P>
    <P>The amendment has been tabled to address a specific problem related to Traveller encampments but it has wider implications because for the first time it will criminalise trespass, which had previously been a civil matter. For example, let us take an industrial dispute which results in a factory closure. If the workers decide to occupy the factory and its grounds, the amendment will criminalise that activity. Was it discussed with the social partners? Were trade unions consulted about the implications of the amendment in regard to industrial disputes?</P>
    <P>The amendment has implications, for example, in disputes about fishing rights. One definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo; in the amendment describes it as &ldquo;land covered by water&rdquo;. There have been, and continue to be, disputes between angling clubs and landowners about access to fishing rights. On a previous occasion, which was referred to by Deputy Stagg on the Order of Business, legislation was rushed through the House which generated considerable anger among angling clubs. Angling clubs and individual anglers are being denied access to rivers and lakes by landowners who believe that if they prevent them from crossing their land, they can claim ownership to the fishing rights. This legislation will be in the eye of a storm. Were angling clubs consulted about the implications of the amendment for them?</P>
    <P>What is being proposed has enormous implications. I recall the discussions we had in the House in regard to occupiers' liability and the question of entry onto property owned by somebody else and whether one is entitled to be on property or whether trespass applies. It is a broad issue, which should not be dealt with by rushing legislation through the House by way of guillotine during the last few days of the Dáil before an election.</P>
    <P>I accept there is a problem and I do not stand over or support the occupation of public grounds or amenities by anybody nor do I, or will I, support destruction of and damage to public amenities. I also accept that arising from incidents that have been experienced in recent summers, there is a need to address this issue but that must be <Col N="587" /> done in a considered way, not through rushed legislation which has wide implications and which will blow up in the Government's face.</P>
    <P>This legislation is being introduced with May in mind rather than June, July and August, when this problem arises in practice. The Government can pass the legislation today and flog it around the country in May on the basis that it has done something to address the problem but when it comes to July and August when this problem is a reality in whatever public park, the legislation will not be enforceable. The people and communities who reside in those areas will have been misled by a Government which is introducing legislation more with an eye on the general election than addressing the real problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing legislation which will have a potentially significant impact on the Traveller community. I am disappointed the legislation is being introduced without corresponding progress on accommodation for the Traveller community, which is unfortunate. I accept, as Deputy Gilmore said, that there have been incidents over the past year and prior to that, where certain lands have been the subject of unauthorised entry but one must understand the Traveller community in order to investigate the reasons for these incidents.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for increasingly large unauthorised encampments in different locations, as happened last summer, is the Traveller community feels more oppressed and threatened and this comes back to the old story of protection in numbers. Travellers have been subject to various negative actions in the past on the part of the settled community. For example, there have been marches by large numbers of settled people on Traveller encampments. When such a march takes place against three or four families, they feel threatened by the numbers protesting. That is a reason for the increase in the size of encampments.</P>
      <P>The other reason is locations that were traditionally available to the Traveller community such as road reservations and so on are no longer available because the roads have been developed or the sites have been sealed off using monstrous boulders which have signs on them reading &ldquo;Travellers, Keep out&rdquo;. The space available to the Traveller community to exercise its nomadism is increasingly drying up and Travellers are compelled to take action which they never took previously. Travellers never occupied public amenities. This is a new phenomenon for the reasons I outlined.</P>
      <P>This issue can be set against the background of what was set out in the excellent report on the Traveller community. It is sad that many of the recommendations, though not all, have not been implemented. A glaring example of this is in the area of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As legislators, we have a duty to seek to ensure the provision of accommodation for the Traveller <Col N="588" /> community because we agreed to that when we accepted the report. There are still 1,200 Traveller families on the side of the road today with nowhere to go and no facilities. Only 100 additional units of accommodation have been provided since the report was published in 1995. This legislation appears to deal with an issue that was of concern to people in the recent past but it neglects the crucial issue of the provision of proper accommodation.</P>
    <P>In local authorities throughout the State, with some honourable exceptions, the responsibilities that should have been discharged by now in the provision of significant numbers of proper accommodation for the Travelling community have not been met. One of the many reasons for that is the reluctance of local authorities, which include elected members of all political parties, to get behind accommodation programmes in their respective areas and take decisions that will ultimately do away with the necessity to introduce legislation of this nature.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is this more apparent than south County Dublin, especially in Tallaght and Clondalkin. Many programmes have been introduced for the provision of accommodation but their implementation has been very slow. In 1985-86, there was a programme to provide two lots of accommodation in each of 15 electoral areas, with one five family unit along the Greenhills Road leading to Tallaght. Only now, 17 years later, has the construction of the accommodation commenced. If we look at the programmes that were adopted with a great deal of media attention, and then look at what was implemented, it is deeply disappointing because so little progress has been made. Until we provide proper levels of accommodation we will always be confronted with the unfortunate necessity for members of the Travelling community to occupy whatever space is available to them. They cannot disappear into thin air. That is what we expect them to do if we cut off the traditional sites they have used for accommodation in the past while waiting for permanent accommodation to be provided.</P>
    <P>Many of the sufferings of the Traveller community are a result of the failure to provide accommodation. There is a 12 year differential in the life expectancy of Traveller adults compared with members of the settled community, with many not living beyond 50. Travellers are committed to their way of life; this is not ideological, it is the tradition they have inherited down through the generations. There is an arrogance on the part of the settled community in saying that we can deal with this issue by putting Travellers into houses. It would be comparable to saying to every Member of this House that he or she must live in a tent or caravan. Most of us would find such a prospect appalling. We, however, in the settled community are inclined to say to the Travelling community at public meetings that we will give them houses. It does not suit their way of life, and they do not pursue that for ideological reasons, but because it is who they are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" />Everyone presenting themselves for election in the general election should be warned that if they get on the anti-Traveller bandwagon, they will get very little support at the ballot box. In the early 1980s in Tallaght, there were horrific marches against members of the Travelling community, and terrible things were said and done to Travellers. Two candidates stood in a general election on an anti-Traveller ticket and Nan Joyce, a Traveller, also stood. Nan Joyce received more first preferences than both the anti-Traveller candidates combined. Articulate people at public meetings who speak out against Travellers and give reasons why they cannot be accommodated in a particular place might give the impression that everyone in the hall takes that position. In the privacy of their own homes, however, people make a different choice. Any public representative climbing on the bandwagon of anti-Traveller sentiment will be sorely disappointed if they are looking for a reward at the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The legislation we are discussing contains issues that are in doubt. The definition of land refers to open space, car parks, playing fields or other spaces provided for recreational, community or conservation purposes. It does not say the lands have to be developed and already available. In the growing urban landscape, lands can be reserved for many years for an ultimate purpose, such as the provision of playing fields, open space or car parks. In the meantime they lie fallow, unused and unprotected, and have frequently been used in the past by the Travelling community because nothing else was available to them. Does this legislation apply if an area has not been developed for its intended purpose? </P>
    <P>This legislation, taken separately from the accommodation issue, will not help matters. Travellers still have to occupy some space because there are 1,200 families on the side of the road with nowhere to go. There are also several hundred families on what we loosely describe as temporary halting sites. These sites deteriorate and frequently do not receive the attention they should from the local authority in terms of upkeep and maintenance. Travellers reach a point where they can no longer live on them and must take to the road. This group must be added when trying to estimate the total number of Travellers on the move.</P>
    <P>Many other issues and difficulties affecting Travellers, including poor health and poor access to health care and education at all levels, emanate from the failure to provide accommodation. Very few Traveller children are engaged in second level education and to the best of my knowledge fewer than three of them are in third level education. The inability of Travellers to avail of their entitlement to be involved in local communities also stems from the lack of accommodation. The difficulty with the amendment is that it would have been more appropriate for the Minister to wait until the other half of the accommodation issue had been addressed before introducing this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" />We need to keep faith with the rights of Travellers with regard to accommodation. This can be done only by ensuring it is provided in the numbers required. The background to the amendment is that the transient sites have not been provided in the numbers the 1995 task force report suggested were required to meet the needs of Travellers. Had this occurred, the legislation would be unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party supports the legislation. I listened very carefully to the comments of the three speakers, particularly those of Deputy Flood, whose approach to this issue I have always admired. He is very brave and genuinely motivated by the best interests of Travellers. However, the matters he raised and the issue the legislation tries to address are two different matters. One of the reasons it has taken the Government so long to accept there is a problem is it did not want to be seen to oppose the accommodation of Travellers. The legislation is not about the accommodation of Travellers, but addresses a practical problem, the relatively new phenomenon of Travellers who have accommodation moving elsewhere to carry out business and, for the most part, engaging in appalling degradation of the environment by dumping the detritus of their businesses on public land and amenities.</P>
      <P>I wish to address a number of issues, particularly those raised by Deputy Gilmore. While I disagree with much of what he said, I agree we should not be passing very important legislation in what is, essentially, two hours. I saw the legislation for the first time this morning. As Deputy Gilmore stated, it is possible that unforeseen problems will arise as a result of flaws in it and we will either rue its introduction or at least be forced to revisit it. As a general principle, we should not introduce and enact legislation on the same day except in extraordinary circumstances.</P>
      <P>This may be a crisis in many areas, but the reality is that it has been a crisis for a very long time and we had considerable notice of the problem. For example, I published legislation on the issue last October, which offered us many opportunities to address the matter in recent months. I regret the way in which we are going about it. Without rehashing the discussions in which we all participated over the airwaves and in various public meetings in recent years, I believe the legislation is absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that consultation is necessary. The legislation specifically deals with trespass on private and public land. If I &ndash; or any member of the public &ndash; was to set up a business on another person's land or front garden or the local football pitch, I would not be entitled to have a committee established to consult on whether it is acceptable to legislate against my actions. It is completely unacceptable that anybody, no matter how deprived, can move onto someone else's land, destroy it and use it as a location for his or her business or move on to football pitches which <Col N="591" /> have been provided either at public expense or, more often, at great local expense and into which the local community has put an enormous amount of work and effort.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore questioned the need for additional legislation given that we already have legislation on this matter. This is not the case and the fact that certain legislation is not enforced is not the root of the problem. If there was legislation to deal with the circumstances on the River Dodder and the many other circumstances which have arisen, it would have been used. This legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>On enforcement, while I accept Deputy Gilmore's point that it would be extremely difficult to equip the Garda to move in against 200 caravans, move them on and arrest all 200 families, this is not what is envisaged. If one takes action against one family, it will act as a deterrent. The purpose of introducing this legislation and all other legislation that seeks to control behaviour is to change public behaviour. While I do not look forward to or anticipate Traveller families being deprived of their homes or thrown in jail, a balance must be struck between the tolerance we must all show to a totally deprived section of the community and the respect that must be shown to the rest of the community, which is entitled to the use of amenities. It is extraordinary to argue that the legislation is not enforceable. If that is the case, what are we doing here? We might as well throw up our hands and leave on the basis that the country is ungovernable because laws cannot be enforced against one section of the community which is outside the law. This is not a valid argument. I would be very worried if one could not enforce reasonable laws to protect public amenities and private land.</P>
    <P>The Deputy described these sites as a summer problem and, as such, it will not become obvious that the legislation cannot be enforced until then. They are a year round problem. The notion that Travellers travel only in summer just as the rest of us like to holiday in summer does not apply in this case. This year-round trading is happening in three locations in my constituency. In one case a public open space which was reinstated at the expense of the residents some weeks ago has now been ploughed up and occupied by Travellers trading in the area. The other two areas are roadside locations which will not be covered by this legislation but which are being used by Travellers to dump rubbish &ndash; not domestic rubbish but rubbish from their businesses, which are in competition with legitimate business people.</P>
    <P>Several things are happening. One is the complete destruction of the urban environment by a series of unauthorised encampments by trader Travellers who seem to have absolutely no regard for the rights of others or the peace of mind or sensitivities of local populations, no matter what the age or vulnerability of those populations. We are also being forced ourselves to destroy the few areas of open space and greenery which are left <Col N="592" /> by piling mounds of soil and building bollards. Why would we do that to our environment when simple legislation such as this could protect those spaces for the public?</P>

      <P>This legislation is not aimed at Travellers in genuine need of accommodation. It is aimed at a particular problem which is relatively new but which is growing and causing huge distress in communities it affects. This never happened in the past. I agree with Deputy Flood when he says that in many areas where Travellers traditionally camped they caused no great annoyance to local communities for the most part. There might have been a minor public health problem for a while but then they would move on and, while it might be going a bit far to say they were welcomed, they were tolerated and not interfered with. There was no huge outcry. This new phenomenon is caused by people who are at least as well off as the public on whom they are visiting their abominations. There is no justification for suggesting we continue to tolerate this. I seek clarification as to whether the legislation applies to encampments on privately owned land and that it is not just a matter of public open spaces.</P>
      <P>I note the legislation does not apply to public roads and I understand why. As my colleague, Deputy Higgins, pointed out, of course Travellers must have somewhere to live if permanent accommodation has not been provided for them. It is perfectly reasonable that until such accommodation has been provided they must have somewhere they can park legally. Members of the public will regret that such areas are not included because this legislation will make no difference to two situations involving Travellers in my area but I can see why the roadside is excluded until permanent accommodation is provided for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flood referred to people assuming there is electoral advantage in taking an anti-Traveller approach. I agree with him that there are no votes in it and anyone taking such a position would be very stupid. In spite of the many fiery meetings I have attended about Travellers, the vast majority of decent people want to see Travellers accommodated. They might not be terribly excited about having Travellers accommodated right next door but that is as much the fault <Col N="593" /> of the local authority as that of the residents. Local authorities have failed in many cases to provide quality accommodation, if they provided it at all, or to enforce the litter laws or provide the cleaning services they would to other communities. I agree with Deputy Flood that the vast majority of people want Travellers accommodated.</P>
    <P>One of the tragedies we have seen over the last few years is that public attitudes have definitely hardened against the Traveller community as a whole. It is getting more and more difficult to persuade even the most well-disposed communities that permanent, decent Traveller accommodation is absolutely essential and that we must all play our part in ensuring such accommodation is provided.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a new moral imperative for all of us &ndash; councillors, local authorities and so on &ndash; now we have been given protection by this strengthened legislation, although I have some problems with the protection of the one mile zone. This amendment will strengthen the hand of the gardaí in dealing with the kinds of problems we have seen. We can offer certain guarantees to the public &ndash; that there are enforceable laws which can protect their amenities and will ensure that saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to five or ten bays will not mean they also have to be subjected to problems. That is happening in Dublin, particularly around the Dodder, where a very successful halting site was accepted by the community. They still had their football pitches and parks destroyed. Now that we can give this sort of protection to the public, I hope councils and councillors will recognise their responsibility to acknowledge that those hundreds of Travellers in genuine need of accommodation will now stand a better chance of being accommodated. Controls are absolutely necessary to stop those Travellers who are not in need of accommodation and who are not deprived in any way from destroying the environment for everyone, including other Travellers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very taken by the sincerity of the last two contributions, which is not to criticise other speakers. I was not present for all of Deputy Gilmore's contribution although I did hear the latter part and will be disagreeing with some points. If ever a matter needed to be debated urgently and in a sincere and focused way, this is it. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, for introducing this legislation.</P>
      <P>I am particularly happy with this amendment for a variety of reasons. Many of the constituents who call to my clinics are Travellers and I agree with Deputy Mitchell that they have suffered incredibly because of the actions of a very small number. Deputies Flood and Gilmore referred to rights and of course they are correct. The members of any minority in our society must have rights and those rights must be vindicated and supported in every way by our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is a hallmark of democracy that <Col N="594" /> rights are balanced with responsibilities. We cannot gainsay that there is a small minority of that minority who are behaving, as Deputy Mitchell correctly said, in a way which is reckless and careless of the rights of society as a whole. As it happens, this amendment follows the precise lines I suggested last October when Deputy Olivia Mitchell introduced her Bill in correspondence with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Although Deputy Gilmore is correct in his statement that trespass has always been a civil matter, the reality, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out in her Private Members' Bill, is that our trespass laws are woefully inadequate.</P>
    <P>A young mother in the Woodlands area of Greystones, who I regard as liberal and tolerant, contacted me recently to express some concerns about a park and ride facility which cost £800,000. It has been invaded by a small group which has decided to make a statement about the superiority of its rights over those of the adjoining community. I do not suggest that Deputy Gilmore or his party condones the fact that the group has systematically destroyed a public amenity. I would blame the local authority if those involved were poor or homeless, but they are not. As Deputy Olivia Mitchell said, this relatively new problem has arisen, in many instances, when people have used public or private lands for private gain. They operate unlicensed businesses, which are not within the tax system, on these lands and dump waste material where they wish and how they wish.</P>
    <P>I was prompted to write to the Minister at some length on this issue last year following an ugly set of incidents in the Newcastle and Kilcoole areas of north east Wicklow. Deputy Gilmore may be aware of the events which were condemned by representatives of all political parties. A small group of people moved on to private property, including sites where homes were being built. When they were approached by the landowners, they said they had nowhere to go and pointed out that they could rent land elsewhere if they were given £1,000. They were simply trying to extract money with menaces. The Garda Síochána in the area, with whom I have had correspondence, were unable to deal with the problems, an experience shared by their colleagues in Greystones, Bray and Shankill. As we all know, the law on trespass places huge pressure on landowners to exert their legal rights, which should not be the case. I proposed to the Minister that the onus of proof should be reversed so that those who enter private property or public amenities have to demonstrate that they have a legal right to occupy the land, or else face being moved on. This proposal is, in effect, the basis of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is not a draconian anti-Traveller Bill and it should not be portrayed as such. Those who cause difficulties are a minority of a minority. I do not wish to be condemnatory of Traveller organisations, as I have a good relationship with them, but they have been too silent on this issue. They have failed to address what I believe has <Col N="595" /> been a betrayal. A single house on the Murrough, outside Wicklow town, has been surrounded by a small group for many years. Gardaí feel they cannot be moved on and the home owner has decided to live elsewhere in the town. Whatever the details behind this case, it should not happen that a home owner should have to move.</P>
    <P>I accept the sincerity of contributions, particularly that of Deputy Flood. The culture and lifestyles of Travellers are being challenged by a changing society, just as ways of life enjoyed by the settled community for many years are being challenged. The type of situations we have seen cannot be condoned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy about assimilation and the rights of a minority culture, but that does not give people rights which are superior to the rights of others. There has to be a balance of rights.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Gilmore's suggestion that this may cause industrial relations problems. He is correct in saying that it would be difficult to enforce the law if a sector of the community decided to invade a property <i>en masse</i>, but that cannot be used as an excuse for not legislating. The reality we have faced for some time is that a minority within the Traveller community, which itself is a minority, has behaved in a reckless manner without concern for the rights of others.</P>
      <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell was correct to say that something beneficial will come out of this if the issue of the invasion of private property, which has been a distraction in recent times, is removed from the political agenda. Perhaps Deputy Flood is correct to say that we could legislate in a different manner and that both sides of the issue could be addressed if we had more time, but as Deputy Mitchell pointed out, this Bill is focused on one item only, namely the deficiency in the operation of our trespass laws. It is a general Bill which applies to all and is not aimed at any particular social group. It will give powers to the Garda which it does not possess at present and a huge onus will be removed from the private individual landowner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know an elderly couple who returned to this country from Zimbabwe a number of years ago. They bought an idyllic property and received planning permission from Wicklow County Council, which is quite difficult to get, for the construction of a house for one of their children on an adjoining site. The property was invaded by a group of five people, however, as soon as the hedgerows were removed. Although the group is well known and has done this on many occasions, the Garda Síochána was incapable of taking any effective action. I cannot criticise the desire of gardaí to address the problem, but there was no effective action they could take. The retired couple had to take action if the trespassers were to <Col N="596" /> be removed, but they did not have the £4,000 or £8,000 it takes to get an injunction. We cannot allow law-abiding citizens and taxpayers who respect the rights of others to remain in such a powerless position, where all the pressure falls on them. I know the couple involved and I can say they are more than accepting of the rights of the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell adverted to a huge controversy some years ago at the halting site in Silverbridge, on the outskirts of Bray. When the facility, which is built to the highest standards, was under construction the local community was guaranteed that it would not face trespass problems. Such problems have arisen again and again, however, in the adjoining areas such as the Upper Dargle Road and Old Fassaroe. A great deal of damage has been done by the development of <i>ad hoc</i> halting sites near tolerant communities which were quite prepared to experiment and to live and let live. The residents of such areas feel they have been betrayed, an experience which has been shared elsewhere and which has been encountered by all Deputies in their communities.</P>
    <P>This is not a draconian Bill. I agree it may have been better if it had been introduced earlier, as I do not like legislation to be introduced on an emergency basis. Laws made in haste are often grieved afterwards. Deputy Olivia Mitchell said this problem has been accumulating in recent years and I feel it has reached crisis proportions in certain areas. This Bill responds modestly to the matter by transferring the onus of proof, in effect, from the small private land owner to the State. I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to make sure this Bill protects the individual private citizen, who has the least power. This changes the onus of action from the individual citizen to the State. Individuals like my constituents in Newcastle had their properties invaded &ndash; let us not be mealy-mouthed about it &ndash; by people who wanted to extract money from them. No Member would condone that nor would any of the Traveller organisations but they should have been more outspoken in their criticism. That was not happening. As one businessman said to me, he could either spend £8,000 and go to the courts not knowing what would happen or give these people £2,000 to get off his property. That is a dilemma that no society should afford to law-abiding citizens. That is what this measure is aimed at. It is not a draconian measure that has any focus outside people who wilfully break the law, wilfully trespass on property and wilfully damage public amenities. I cannot believe that the vast majority of members of the Travelling community would support the type of grievous action being taken by a minority.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome. I agree with the general view that it would be better if the legislation were introduced in more normal circumstances. This Dáil is not drawing its last gasp, it is drawing its penultimate gasp. We would betray those we are here to represent if we allowed the <Col N="597" /> current situation to continue into the summer. I hope the introduction of this legislation will not be seen as a cynical effort because it is not. I made these same proposals last October having been much impressed by the Private Members' legislation introduced by Deputy Mitchell. I would hope that, rather than criticise the issue, we will improve it.</P>
    <P>I commend this legislation, particularly this provision, and am grateful for the opportunity to acknowledge the role played by the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, in bringing the legislation forward.</P>

      <P>I oppose in the strongest terms amendments Nos. 11 to 15 in the name of Deputy Mitchell and amendments Nos. 1 and 16 in the name of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. We are being asked to pass very substantial amendments which amount to a major new Bill and which have far reaching implications for civil rights. None of this was in the original Bill, nor was it published, to my knowledge, to accommodate an informed debate. There had been no signalling of the Minister's amendments prior to this morning. Yet the Minister is asking the House, in its last days, to adopt a major change to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, tagged on in the form of an amendment to a Bill which is supposed to be about housing.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;Travellers&rdquo; is not mentioned in these amendments but we know it is against Travellers that they are directed. Outside the House today are representatives of the Irish Traveller Movement, the Travellers Cultural Centre, Pavee Point and the National Traveller Women's Forum. They are rightly outraged that this amendment has been tabled by the Minister without any consultation with Traveller representatives. Let me ask a question. Is this the best way to address the stated concerns of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and Deputies Mitchell and Roche, concerns which I acknowledge require addressing? The answer, in my opinion, is a categoric &ldquo;no&rdquo;. What is happening is that the oxygen that sustains the earnest address of Traveller needs is being poisoned by this measure.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the County Monaghan Traveller Accommodation Consultation Committee and I can only imagine the reaction of some other elected colleagues, dedicated and sincere council officials, and of the representatives of the Traveller community in County Monaghan who sit on that committee to this disgraceful piggyback exercise by the Government in its dying hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mary O'Donoghue of the National Traveller Women's Forum states that Traveller representatives on the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee will be considering their further participation on the committee and their engagement with the national Traveller accommodation strategy if these amendments are passed. She states that the Minister's failure to <Col N="598" /> inform them of the amendments makes a mockery of their work at all levels and I agree.</P>
    <P>Martin Collins of Pavee Point states that it is impossible for the Minister to expect Traveller organisations to work closely with his Department when he does not even inform them that he is about to increase local authority powers to evict Travellers and criminalise communities of Travellers because they have nowhere to live. The backdrop to today's debate is the failure of successive Governments to provide adequate accommodation of a sufficient standard to the Traveller community. There are only 111 units of Traveller specific accommodation when a promised 2,200 units were identified and are required. That is the backdrop to these amendments. The Government and the local authorities have failed to provide the promised accommodation, including halting sites. Now Travellers are to be subject to these new draconian laws so that local authorities and the Garda can remove them in a summary fashion. That is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendments also have wider implications for civil rights which have been alluded to by Deputy Gilmore. We will be asked within one hour of my speaking here to enact major new laws on trespass giving very wide new powers to the local authorities and the Garda. This has implications for the rights to peaceful protest. We received the amendment only yesterday and are being asked to enact it today. There is no proper scrutiny and no proper debate. Some people know the questions and believe they have a monopoly on the answers but, quite clearly, they do not. This is a cynical pre-election ploy by the Government which will do nothing to address the need of Traveller accommodation. It will, as I have already stated, poison the atmosphere in which we are trying to foster better relations between Travellers and the settled community.</P>
    <P>While I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for being here and presenting the case, I regret very much that the Minister with responsibility for housing is not present. It is an indication of the Minister's own attitude to the issue and the focus of the debate and is completely unacceptable. I call on the Minister of State, and on the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and his colleagues in Government even at this late stage to withdraw these amendments.</P>

        <b>: </b>This is an incredible way to attempt to progress legislation in Dáil Éireann. It is highly insulting to the elected representatives of all the Irish people to present such a far-reaching measure that most of us received a few hours before the debate and to attempt to ram it through the Dáil, after a few hours of discussion. The biggest party in Opposition stands condemned for its willingness to go along with this treatment of Dáil Éireann. That party might as well be part of the Government as far as this measure is concerned. If the members of the main Opposition party were to put the manner in which the business of Dáil Éireann is conducted <Col N="599" /> and the minute scrutiny of legislation to the head of its considerations, they would clamour in opposition to what the Government is trying to do. It is shameful that they are colluding with Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the shameful treatment of this very complex subject and in treating Dáil Éireann in this fashion.</P>
      <P>The evident lack of consultation on this measure with those who represent Travelling people is also shameful in the extreme. This is the Government, joined by Fine Gael on all occasions, which claims that partnership is the way forward. They have used the concept of partnership, in a fraudulent way as far as the trade union movement is concerned, to say bosses, Government and workers are in this together and that is why wages must be kept down.</P>
      <P>The same concept was, supposedly, in play with regard to social issues, with the members of the Travelling community and their support groups being consulted in so-called partnership with Government and with other agencies responsible for the accommodation and other needs of that community. However, without so much as a reference to any of them, this draconian legislation has landed in front of the national Parliament with a direction that it be rammed through in a few hours. It is absolutely shameful.</P>
      <P>This is entirely the wrong way to deal with a problem. Everyone accepts that a problem is created when a group of Travelling people or traders pull onto public amenity land, but the Government is approaching the problem from the wrong direction. To start with oppressive legislation, which will not work, as a means of solving serious social problems is wrong and will be shown to be counter-productive. This proposed legislation is before us because of the lamentable failure of this Government in the past five years and of successive Governments before that to deal with the genuine accommodation needs of the Travelling community. It is an admission of the most abject failure of this and previous Governments to resolve this problem, that we have this legislation before us today.</P>
      <P>It is incredible that in 2002, in the land of the so-called Celtic tiger, when we speak of information highways and the last word in technology with regard to most areas of life, more than 1,000 Irish families live in squalor on the sides of our roads. That is a shameful affront to the Irish people and a shameful failure by successive Governments whose responsibility it is to deal with the accommodation needs of Travelling people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell from her comfortable affluent home in suburbia has spoken many times on this issue. I have never heard her and others like her championing the urgent need for emergency measures to provide accommodation for Travelling people. If members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were in Brazil they would be on the side of the ranchers who are evicting native people from their lands to make way for cattle <Col N="600" /> and other enterprises. Property and the interests of the wealthy come first with the establishment politicians, whether here or in Brazil.</P>
    <P>The clear solution to the accommodation needs of the Travelling people is a combination of Travelling people being given homes in settled communities, group housing schemes or halting sites, whichever is their wish. It is incredible that in 2002 we still do not have a Government which can pilot through the proposals and measures of local authorities and various agencies to offer that combination of accommodation which would cater for the needs of just over 1,000 homeless families.</P>
    <P>The solution to the question of that section of the Travelling community who engage in trades of different kinds is obvious, but not a finger has been raised to take the obvious action. The answer to the problem is the provision of transient sites around the major trading or population centres so that supervised provision can be made for those who engage in this type of trade at various times of the year. The energies of those politicians who have been holding forth at their local parish pumps against Travellers who are involved in trading would have been better applied in seeing how such transient sites could have been successfully installed, particularly around the capital city. That would have removed the problem of people with no place to carry on their trade.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is clear that an ethnic group which has been marginalised in our society for centuries needs special assistance with regard to the provision of resources to enable them to go forward commercially and establish, for their communities, employment in successful, environmentally friendly, small commercial enterprises. Such assistance would lift the entire Travelling community through the employment and extra wealth it would generate.</P>
    <P>The establishment politicians are utterly blind to the needs of this section of our people in real terms. The Minister for Finance, backed by Fine Gael, a few months ago slashed corporation tax to 16%, giving back &euro;329 million in tax cuts to big business in this year alone and further cuts every year thereafter. The business sector cannot believe the profitability it has enjoyed in the recent years of the so-called Celtic tiger. We see this type of treatment for the big corporations and a failure even to see how a section of our society which has been brutalised for so long could be given a lift. Why do establishment parties not have the same appreciation of the necessity for this as they have of the need to cater for big business and millionaire industrialists?</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for about 11 years. Before I was on the local authority, a major controversy erupted in the area in which I live in Mulhuddart in 1990 when the local authority came up with an insane scheme of taking a barren field and proposing to put anything up to 80 to 100 Traveller families on it. The only resources were earthen mounds and cold water. Of course, we opposed it. It would have been a <Col N="601" /> social wound of incredible proportions if that had been inflicted on the Traveller people and on the local settled people. However, we opposed it in a particular way. We engaged in dialogue with the Traveller people concerned, set up a united committee and came up with a united approach. We said we did not want that but wanted smaller, well resourced sites or group housing schemes. As a result of that joint approach, we stopped the madness being proposed and achieved a very well designed group housing scheme and a lot of good. I am sorry to say that has not been carried forward sufficiently throughout the local authority area. However, it shows how problems can be resolved and that partnership, a joint approach between Traveller people and the local settled community and mutual understanding are necessary if we are to resolve the accommodation issue.</P>
    <P>The problems that have arisen need to be addressed. They will be addressed primarily by providing the type of resources needed. Repressive legislation is not the answer. Let us be quite clear about that. Deputies who have stood up here and who are, effectively, voting to have caravans, maybe with families still inside them, towed away and to have entire families arrested stand condemned for their support for such a measure.</P>
    <P>Bringing families to the District Courts on foot of injunctions was not a constructive way to resolve the disputes that arose. However, one could say that if such a dispute came before a judge, at least people would have the chance to make the arguments. One could outline the desperate conditions of the family. If there are millionaire traders in the Traveller community, which I hear right-wing politicians occasionally say &ndash; I would say there are very few &ndash; they will not end up in front of the District Court because they will be gone. However, a destitute family at least would have the right to come before the court and perhaps with their support groups and lawyers explain the situation to the judge, that is, that they have absolutely nowhere to go. If this Bill is passed, gardaí, probably armed with batons and so on, will arrive on sites at dawn to drag people off. That is the solution being proposed here, which is absolutely unbelievable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche spoke about the problem of dumping in Wicklow. There has been an incredible problem with dumping in Wicklow. Hundreds of tonnes of the most horrific rubbish, probably toxic and other materials, have been dumped around Wicklow but it has not been the Traveller community that has been dumping it &ndash; it is big business and the construction industry. We do not yet know the role the local authority or individuals on the local authority played. That remains to be seen. Let us have balance on these matters and try to puncture the prejudices of those who stand here for the major parties.</P>
    <P>I with to refer to land, the sanctity of private ownership, business land and so on. Again, here we have the sickening double standards of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. There has been a grotesque <Col N="602" /> abuse of land in the Dublin area but not a voice of opposition has been raised by those parties to that abuse. I speak of wealthy landowners who have taken this valuable resource and who profiteered and speculated shamelessly with land so that the price of a home for ordinary people, including young people, is two, three or four times what it was four or five years ago. That is the most grotesque abuse of land I know in the greater Dublin area but I did not see emergency legislation before the Dáil from the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government or demands from Fine Gael that that type of grotesque abuse be restrained. What we have here is a one-sided and hypocritical approach which will not be successful in resolving the problems.</P>
    <P>For over ten years I have listened to and have never ceased to be amazed by the assumptions of the establishment politicians. Some time ago I heard politicians in my local authority demand that there be a provision in the planning law, the county development plan or wherever that if a legal, prescribed Traveller site is located in a certain area, that no other such site be located within a mile or two of the original site. I am amazed by this type of assumption. I find millionaire mansions quite offensive but if I suggested that in Howth or Foxrock, where a millionaire has his or her mansion, no further mansion be allowed within a mile of that &ndash; if I stood up and seriously proclaimed that as a policy &ndash; I can imagine the type of drubbing I would get from those on the benches in front of me. I would be dismissed as a madman and so on. That is precisely the inverse of what the establishment politicians are saying in regard to the Traveller community.</P>
    <P>What we have here is a continuation of the same old story, prejudices and failures. I want to see the problems of the Traveller community and their accommodation needs resolved. It is in the resolution of those needs and the resourcing of the needs, in a commercial sense, of sections of that community that the problem will be solved and not by this type of measure.</P>
    <P>Mar chríoch, tá an Rialtas ag teacht isteach anseo inniu agus ag tabhairt isteach reachtaíochta a bhaineann le daoine atá faoi chois sa tír seo leis na cianta &ndash; seanslíocht na nGael, daoine atá ceangailte don dtaobh amuigh leis na blianta.

      <P>Considerable progress has been made in the provision of Traveller accommodation in recent years. The Government has enacted the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, set up a dedicated Traveller accommodation unit in my Department and provided funds for local authorities to increase the provision of Traveller accommodation. Local authorities have adopted five year programmes under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, and are in the process of implementing them. These programmes identify a need for the provision for 3,785 units of all kinds of accommodation to meet Traveller's needs in the period of the programme, 2000-04. A total of 550 families have been accommodated in the first two years of the programme. They are accommodated in standard local authority housing, Traveller specific accommodation and housing provided by voluntary bodies. Traveller specific accommodation includes group housing and halting sites. In addition to providing accommodation directly, local authorities provide new house grants and special Traveller grants to assist Travellers in the purchase of their own houses. Local authorities also provide assistance under the rental subsidy scheme to voluntary bodies in the provision of accommodation to Travellers.</P>
      <P>It is pleasing to see these improvements arising in the first and second years of the programme. That is not to say we should be entirely satisfied with progress. An increased level of provision is required to meet the current and future needs of Travellers. Expenditure on Traveller accommodation arises under a number of headings. Travellers are accommodated in standard local authority houses. In the past two years 299 Traveller families were accommodated in this way. Expenditure on Traveller specific accommodation such as group housing, permanent, temporary and emergency halting sites has also increased. The total capital expenditure since the Government came into power amounts to &euro;72.5 million. In 2000 alone, &euro;23.1 million was spent on providing new and refurbishing existing Traveller specific accommodation. Expenditure is also incurred in the management and maintenance of such accommodation, recouping the costs of social workers as well as from the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee. These costs amount to a further &euro;15.7 million and give rise to a total spend of &euro;98.2 million. This is a significant investment in Traveller accommodation and is a measure of the Government's commitment to meet Traveller needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accommodation provided reduces the numbers on the roadside. The past two years have seen the number of families living on the roadside reduced by 190. This is the first time in a number of years that this has happened. The reduction is welcome when taken in the context <Col N="604" /> of the increase in the overall number of Traveller families by 360. These figure clearly show the Government's commitment to Traveller accommodation.</P>
    <P>Travellers have always been engaged in a nomadic way of life. It is part of their culture and it is expected that this will continue. There have been many cases where there has been little or no difficulty attached to such movement in what were in effect unauthorised encampments. Circumstances have changed in recent years. There has been an increase in the scale of such encampments. The large scale of such encampments, in some cases numbering more than 100 caravans, has exacerbated the situation. The nature of such encampments has also changed. Many Travellers in unauthorised encampments are there to engage in commercial or trading activities. Many of them have permanent accommodation elsewhere, either in this State or outside it. The length of such stays has also increased. In a much publicised incident in south Dublin last year, some Travellers stayed for up to seven months. While some who stayed for this length of time were awaiting permanent accommodation, others were engaged in commercial activity. We have seen indications of this again this year.</P>
    <P>The amendment is primarily aimed at land used for recreational and amenity purposes and private lands. This arises from the entry on to lands such as public parks and playing fields of large scale unauthorised encampments. In some cases they remain there for several months. We have also seen incursions on private land and not all of those incidents received headline publicity. Many of these were on such lands while the occupants were in the area engaging in commercial or trading activities, sometimes at the camp location. The presence of such encampments degraded the amenities which were provided for the use and enjoyment of the public. We have seen the effect of these encampments in the indiscriminate dumping, sometimes in rivers or streams, of debris associated with the occupational activities of the owners of the temporary dwellings. I am not speaking about families on short visits to relatives or on the move for short periods as part of their annual patterns of movement. Neither am I speaking of families on the roadside or other public lands with whom the local authorities are acquainted, pending the provision of permanent accommodation. While local authorities must provide transient sites, it has not been envisaged that such facilities would cater for the type of long-term stay which has been a feature of the large scale unauthorised encampments we have experienced in recent years.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee on the implementation of the recommendations of the task force was asked by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the Private Members' Bill and advise, among other matters, on issues relating to the enforcement and adequacy of existing laws dealing with unauthorised temporary dwellings, trespass and public <Col N="605" /> order. The sub-committee that considered the issues is representative of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment and Local Government, local authorities, Traveller support groups, the Garda and business interests. Its brief was to seek consensus on the issues before it. While the committee has not yet finalised its report, indications are that there will be no general agreement on making changes to existing legislation. The issue of trespass was discussed and the Garda are on the sub-committee. The draft report of the sub-committee recommended that trespass not be criminalised. While the amendment will apply to trespass generally, it will apply only where a person enters land without the owner's consent and where the presence of the person or his vehicle could substantially damage the land or associated amenities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell raised a question about the delay in bringing legislation before the House. I can assure the House that we have not let the dust settle on this issue. Since the publication of Deputy Mitchell's private Members' Bill, my officials have given very serious consideration to this issue. We have obtained legal advice on the various aspects of it. The House will realise that this amendment raised very serious and fundamental questions relating to unauthorised dwellings and the appropriate mechanism to deal with them. Our priority was to develop an appropriate response to deal with this issue. The provision explicitly provides that land, for the purpose of the new powers, includes lands provided or maintained by statutory bodies primarily for the amenity or recreation of the public or any class of persons and land within the curtilage of a public building. It specifies that this includes any park, open space, car park, playing field or other space provided for recreational, community or conservation purposes. &ldquo;Land&rdquo; is also deemed to include land held by trustees for the benefit of the public or any class of the public, and would include schools, for example. The provision makes it clear that entry onto any land, including private land, will be subject to the new powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's response is disappointing. He has not addressed the issues put to him. He gave many figures about the Traveller accommodation programme, but did not address my point that the Traveller specific accommodation was to have been about 2,200 units, of which only around 100 have been provided to date, leaving a serious shortfall. He also effectively confirmed the existence of a draft report from the sub-committee which addressed this. We have not seen this draft report that did not deliver what the Government wanted and so was ignored. In fairness to the committee, it should at least be allowed to complete the report, have it published and considered in the normal way. It is arrogant of the Government, having established a committee to examine a particular problem, to do the opposite to what the commit<Col N="606" /> tee recommends because it does not like its findings.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State did not answer my question about the Garda. Was the Garda consulted about this legislation and what is its view of it? It is irresponsible of the Oireachtas to enact legislation about the enforcement of which doubts exist. It is not a question, as Deputy Mitchell appeared to imply, of it being our job to legislate and someone else's to enforce the legislation. We have a responsibility, when enacting legislation, to take account of its capacity to be enforced. Deputy Mitchell made the point that we cannot expect gardaí to arrest everyone in a place where 100 caravans are parked, but that they could arrest one family. That suggests that this legislation will not be used in the type of circumstance for which it has purportedly been introduced. We all agree that the huge convoy of trader Travellers, which appears on an open space, is a problem, but this legislation will not be used in this circumstance as we do not expect gardaí to intervene.</P>

      <P>Let us consider this carefully because this is where the issue of enforceability will come into play. This legislation fundamentally changes the responsibility for the enforcement of the law in relation to Traveller encampments. Until now, as we all know from experience, where such an encampment caused a problem, both the Garda and the local authority had roles to play, and usually the situation was resolved. However, this changes dramatically under this legislation because as soon as a caravan appears on a piece of open or public ground it will be up to the Garda to remove it. The legislation says that a member of the Garda, who has reason to believe that a person is committing an offence under this legislation, may demand that person's name and address, may direct him or her to leave the land, and so on. Gardaí will be under pressure from local communities to move encampments on. Has the Minister discussed this with the Garda to ascertain if it believes it will be able to implement it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This island has, unfortunately, experienced many instances of legislation being passed which pitched the police force against sections of the community. If this legislation is enacted, I will encourage people to comply and abide with it, but it does not take a genius to envisage the type of situation which this legislation is teeing up, namely conflict between the Garda and groups of <Col N="607" /> Travellers, and also, as I stated previously, with others such as protesters demonstrating in a field against GMO foods. With 15 minutes to go, will the Minister tell us if there was discussion with the Garda and what is its view on the enforceability? Has he received observations from the Garda Commissioner, and, if so, will he put them on the record before the debate is over?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to say that I hold Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, in high personal and political regard and thank him for coming here to take this legislation. However, there are some areas that have not been satisfactorily addressed.</P>
      <P>The first is the lack of consultation. Representatives of the Traveller community are aggrieved that they were not consulted and that this legislation was introduced in parallel to work they were doing. Many were suspicious of becoming involved at a central level with statutory agencies because of recent negative experiences. They felt that their contributions were not highly regarded and they had great difficulty in meeting agencies and local authorities. It was a major step for them to become involved with central planning. Therefore, they are aggrieved that they were locked out of the process on this important issue, and this may impact adversely on their willingness to work with State agencies.</P>
      <P>When I, as a Minister, had to make a difficult decision, I met with organisations working in the field, even if they disagreed with me, to explain why I was taking a particular course of action. I may even have been influenced by them on occasion and adopted another approach. The level of consultation which occurred on this issue does not appear to have been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Some Members, such as Deputies Joe Higgins and Ó Caoláin, felt it necessary to lash this and previous Governments on the accommodation issue, but this is not a simple matter. Various Governments have taken different decisions with regard to providing proper accommodation.</P>
      <P>The real problem at local authority level is that elected members of all parties, including my own, do not co-operate in the implementation of the accommodation plans. Travellers are disappointed with the lack of proper treatment of and status for the local Traveller consultative committees and, in most cases, they find them a waste of time. If the operational responsibility to provide accommodation rests with local authorities, as is currently the case, it is for the elected members of all political parties, including my own, to take the necessary decisions. The issue of accommodation could then be dealt with properly and we would no longer be in conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conflict at local community level is a serious matter. Deputy Gilmore referred to it in his contribution. I am greatly concerned that local gardaí will be dragooned or forced, almost as an element of the State, into becoming anti-Traveller. That is the last thing the gardaí I know would wish for <Col N="608" /> but because of this significant change they will be drawn into conflict. I can picture in my mind large numbers of gardaí with batons drawn, large numbers of caravans, children frightened and women upset. That will do nothing for a community which might feel aggrieved, the Travellers or the image of this State.</P>
    <P>This is not the correct way to deal with the problem. The correct way to deal with it is to provide the accommodation, as outlined in 1995. Having worked with the representative organisations and agreed that the issue is now complete in terms of accommodation provision, there may then be room to tighten up the law, as the Travellers representative organisations have said. Unfortunately, whether we like it or not this provision will lead to conflict, and that is not good at community level where bitterness, hatred and racism will rear their ugly heads because of what will be seen as a heavy-handed response to Travellers occupying a piece of ground, for whatever reason, which others believe they should not occupy. That is the reason I am disappointed with this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond to the question of people not being consulted. I understand from what the Minister of State said that a number of issues were referred for consultation by the group of the various interests, including Travellers, the Garda Síochána, his own Department and so on, and I assume the report of that group will be accepted and considered by the Minister. There are a number of issues surrounding the way in which Travellers and their culture can be accommodated in our society and I agree with Deputy Higgins, although I do not often agree with him, that there is a need to find a way in which Travellers can find employment for themselves and their community, and examine the way transient sites might operate. It was not envisaged that transient sites would be occupied for seven or eight months of the year in the way that some of the illegal transient sites are operated for the purposes of trading. There are various issues, therefore, that this legislation does not even attempt to address but which need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>This proposal is not the total answer to dealing with a problem which is related to the accommodation of Travellers and the way their economy, if it can be described that way, can be facilitated in a non-confrontational way. We talk about consulting people on whether someone has a right to break into private property. I received letters from two unfortunate people in Deputy Flood's constituency who are trying to carry on a business in an industrial estate but whose business premises are occupied by Travellers. Their business is effectively gone. Who has the right to be consulted about whether that is right or wrong? It is either right or wrong, and I believe it is wrong.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said there will be confrontation. There will be no more confrontation than there is with any legislation we pass to prevent activity that this society considers wrong. If there is confrontation it will be because someone is trying to break the law. Why is that different from any other type of legislation? Deputy Flood said it would create bitterness. I do not know if there is anything I have experienced in all my years as a public representative that has created more bitterness and disillusionment among the public than the kind of incursions we have seen in recent times. There is a real sense among the public that they are helpless and that the law does nothing to protect them. Elderly people are being terrorised for months at a time and are left with a sense that other sections of the community have rights that they do not have and that they can vindicate their perceived rights at the expense of the rest of the community. That is causing greater bitterness than any attempt to enforce laws we are passing now.</P>
      <P>This type of legislation is necessary. I do not foresee it resulting in confrontational scenes, unless they are staged. Behaviour will change. There will be a moral imperative on local authorities, county managers, elected representatives and the community as a whole, which now has this protection, to ensure that accommodation is provided for Travellers. I agree with Deputy Higgins on the need for the development of a Traveller economy in a way that is not an affront to the rest of the community but which allows Travellers to provide employment not only for themselves but for other members of the community. I support the amendment.</P>

        <b>: </b>This legislation has serious implications for trade unionists and for environmental activists but, unfortunately, there is not enough time to go into that aspect. I will deal briefly with points raised by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Flood. Let us take the case of a family of four living in the location being objected to which has nowhere else to go. The recourse now is to send the gardaí to the location but what will happen then? If the family has nowhere to go, <Col N="610" /> how can the gardaí deal with the problem? They can deal with it by drawing batons and driving them off the land. They can impound the caravan, but where will the family go? What will happen to the children? Until now, the local authority intervened and some form of mediation took place with perhaps some kind of alternative accommodation being found. What we have here is a problem not unlike the apartheid South Africa squatter situation, where the state moved in with a heavy hand to deal with what was also a social problem.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing the last minute of the debate with me. There are two ways of approaching all problems, either by carrot or stick or a combination of both but all I see employed in relation to the issue of Traveller accommodation and the &ldquo;move-on&rdquo; mentality is stick, stick, stick, and we are seeing more of it here today. It is a disgrace. As Deputy Higgins said, the housing authorities, our county authorities, have prime responsibility for providing housing accommodation. To where will the Garda redirect people in situations where they force them to move-on? Unless we address the need to provide essential accommodation opportunities in a range of different ways, ways identified by Travellers, we will never find a solution to this matter. We certainly will not find one by way of the type of proposition that has been put before this House at this sad moment in the dying hours of this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to receive Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg during his recent visit to Ireland &ndash; his second official visit to an EU member state since he succeeded his father.</P>
      <P>During our meeting we reviewed the excellent bilateral relations between Ireland and Luxembourg. The Grand Duke expressed his admiration for Ireland's recent economic success and I thanked him for agreeing to lend the Riesen Bibel to Trinity College.</P>
      <P>On my plans for forthcoming official visits, I have already informed the House that I have been invited to attend the EU-Latin America Caribbean Summit to be held in Madrid on 17-18 May. This summit affords an opportunity for EU member states and Latin American and Caribbean states to discuss a broad range of political, economic and cultural issues. In common with several EU partners, my attendance has not yet been confirmed. I am also scheduled to attend the Seville European Council on 21 and 22 June.</P>
      <P>The Forum on Europe, an independent body, has taken extensive steps to promote public awareness of its work generally and, in particular, its recent report. I referred to the work of the Forum when updating other leaders at the Barcelona European Council on the position regarding the Nice treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my attendance at the Barcelona European Council, I refer the Deputy to my statement to the House on Wednesday last, 20 <Col N="614" /> March. I did not have any formal bilateral meetings at the Council, although I did have informal discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on the margins of the Council. As I informed the House last week, we discussed a number of current issues and the continued implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I have no plans to meet the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In my Dáil statement on the Barcelona European Council, I indicated I had informed my EU colleagues that the Government would seek a Declaration from the Seville European Council confirming that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality was not affected by the treaties. The Council welcomed this approach and reiterated its willingness to contribute in every way possible to supporting the Irish Government in this process and agreed to come back to this issue at its next meeting in Seville.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions arise from the Taoiseach's reply. Why is the Taoiseach in a position to reply to questions regarding the Grand Duke of Luxembourg when he was unable to answer questions regarding his recent meeting with Prince Charles? Is there discrimination within the republican party between one kind of royalty and another? Perhaps it relates to the fact that the Taoiseach's photo opportunity with Prince Charles was better than the one he had with the Grand Duke.</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach had time to reflect on the discussions which took place in this House in recent days regarding the content of the draft declaration, a copy of which he now admits he has seen? I am referring to the draft declaration that will emerge from Barcelona following consultation in Ireland. Can the Taoiseach confirm that a draft declaration exists, that it is available and that he intends publishing it so that those who failed to vote in the Nice referendum may come out on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs are working on a draft declaration. It is merely a draft and is not yet ready for circulation. I am open to agreement on any form of communication decided upon by this House in that regard. I plan to consult widely on the issue. I hope to be in a position to do so soon although I have not worked out how best to do it. The matter is also being considered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am ready to listen to any suggestions on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that this Oireachtas may not return after Easter. If it does, it will be for a very short time. It is absolutely incumbent that the current Government, including the Taoiseach, initiates an immediate debate &ndash; the election is to take place during the second fortnight in May and negotiations on the formation of a Government will leave little time available for a debate before the Spanish Presidency &ndash; on the <Col N="615" /> terms of any declaration which may emerge from Seville so that such a declaration receives acceptance from the Irish people in terms of removing some of the reservations they have about Ireland's participation in European reaction force measures. It is important such a debate takes place now so that whoever is Taoiseach in the next Government will be in a position to go to Seville in the third week in June and say, authoritatively, to the other heads of Government that such a declaration will be acceptable if granted as part of and parcel of the conclusion of the Spanish Presidency. It is a matter of urgency that the Taoiseach publish a draft declaration, in the clear understanding that that is what it is, so that those who have reservations or who want to see progress made can respond in a way that will assist in the completion of this essential document so we can have the Nice treaty ratified and proceed to enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn's remarks. The declaration, which is political, is crystal clear on the existing position &ndash; Ireland's military neutrality is not affected by membership of the European Union. Some people have suggested there should be a meeting of the Forum in this regard but that does not include everybody, others said we should consult with party leaders or that it should be a matter for the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I will await completion of the draft by the Department of Foreign Affairs at which time I will consult the relevant parties. I will then consider publishing it. I note, having watched the ritualistic games at the Forum last week, that people tend to move quickly from one point to another. I accept the point made by Deputy Quinn. I have made that point also. I accept that this matter must be cleared up within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if I would call the debate on the crisis on the future of Europe a game, it is still worth debating. Will the Taoiseach agree that Mr. Prodi has a more philosophical view of the matter based on the fact that enlargement can proceed &ndash; there is nothing legally preventing it from proceeding &ndash; regardless of whether we endorse the Nice treaty? With regard to improving and amending the treaty, when will the wording of the proposed neutrality declaration be available? Did the Taoiseach examine the wording of the Danish declaration given that similar considerations were occupying the minds of the Danish electorate? What is his view of the Danish wording? Could a great deal of trouble be saved if it were adopted? Why did the Taoiseach state in a newspaper article that a declaration to the Nice treaty would be legally binding given that my legal advice is that it would not? If the treaty is so badly desired by all the other member states, even though none of them held a referendum, could he convince them to agree a protocol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="616" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has been examining what happened in regard to the Danish decision for a considerable time. I believe a declaration is required. The important issue is not the legality of the declaration but that all member state colleagues agree a political declaration that makes clear the existing position, which is that Ireland's military neutrality is in no way affected by its membership of the European Union and is covered in the treaties.</P>
      <P>A protocol to the treaty must be agreed and ratified by all member states and, as both myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have stated during Question Time previously, the treaty negotiations have concluded. A number of member states have completed the process of ratification, which varies from parliament to parliament, but it has been concluded. Others have chosen to finalise the process in a different way but most have ratified the treaty. In any event, my advice is that a protocol is unnecessary as the treaty recognises Irish military neutrality.</P>
      <P>Following the defeat of the first referendum on the Maastricht treaty, Denmark sought to obtain clarification first at the Edinburgh European Council and this provided the basis for its second successful referendum. However, it took another four years before Denmark negotiated a protocol to the Amsterdam treaty, which is one of the sorrier things the Danes did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I am not sure where the Taoiseach is coming from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe if a declaration is fully negotiated along the lines he has mentioned it will be sufficient to ensure the passing of the Nice treaty in the next referendum or will he propose other measures to ensure the decision making process in Europe is seen by the electorate to be open and transparent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three or four issues when one examines the research that has been undertaken by different groups, including the Government research unit. The biggest issue was a lack of understanding of the treaty but the second one was neutrality and sovereignty. There is also the issue of how we conduct our business in the House, which all of us have identified, and we spoke about that yesterday in the context of the contents of the European Union Bill. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Séamus Brennan, made a statement to the forum recently on how we conduct our business. Then there is the communicating Europe issue, in which everybody has a role. The Government and I certainly have a role in trying to sell the bigger picture because the debate is not just on the Nice treaty but also on the greater European model, the benefits of membership of the Union and how it helps us socially, economically and regionally. All these issues are challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many smaller issues fed into the research but <Col N="617" /> enlargement is not one. Certain groups worry about enlargement. That is not a major issue. It has not been borne out by research or by the leadership of these groups. While it might be a concern to some people, it is not the big issue. The big issue is addressing sovereignty and neutrality. Due to the way issues were put across, mothers, in particular, were concerned that they overlapped with European security and defence issues in a way they did not understand.</P>
    <P>We all know the treaty refers only in two instances to European security and defence and neither is earth shattering. The first mention deletes a reference to the Western European Union, which was welcomed in the House during the debate. The second reference is to a political and security committee made up of Brussels-based officials representing national governments, which replaces a committee served by officials travelling from capitals. There is nothing in the area of European security and defence about which we should be concerned but I was the first to accept that we lost on that one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government surely did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not convince the people that was the position. They believed that European armies and conscription were involved. No part of the Nice treaty could conceivably impact on or threaten our traditional policy of neutrality. All the claims about the treaty threatening our neutrality are empty scaremongering by those who do not want Ireland to have an involvement in Europe and that was quite clear from the transcripts of the last three or four sessions of the forum.</P>
      <P>However, we have to put a crystal clear declaration before the Seville Council and get it passed. I would like to do that sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Former commissioner Ray MacSharry is one of the people the Taoiseach has appointed to the European convention. Has he had a briefing from him about the early discussions at the convention? I reiterate a question which the Taoiseach was unable to answer on a previous occasion. Will the Government put forward specific Irish proposals on the future development of Europe at the convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We will ultimately but the initial stage of the convention is a listening exercise. It will go through all the issues that have been thrown up. Mr. MacSharry was one of the first speakers at the first meeting and he put forward a number of issues. Other representatives, including Bobby McDonagh, Department of Foreign Affairs, are working closely with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and my Department on how we will handle the forum. It will not be until the session after the summer that we will get into detailed proposals following the German election. That is the political reality. The early discussions will be on all the four issues that have <Col N="618" /> been put forward and a number of other issues that people wish to raise, including a European constitution, subsidiarity and so on. We will not get down to a hard, factual position until the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a possibility that discussions at the European convention in the autumn could raise issues which might make it even more difficult to ratify the Nice treaty at home? Has the Taoiseach thought about this and does he have a strategy in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did think about that and that is why I wanted to deal with the Treaty of Nice earlier. In the last week of the campaign, a number of European leaders set out their ideas on issues unrelated to the treaty. Although everyone in the House understands, we must keep emphasising that the Treaty of Nice deals with enlargement and must be dealt with to allow the process to continue. The Forum for Europe deals with wider issues and some contributions go into broader concerns where it is unlikely there will ever be agreement. It is a system where people put forward their views about issues that concern not just the next five years but the long-term. We cannot do much about that. An appeal could be made to governments not to confuse issues but, with the forum consisting of 100 people, it is difficult to stop them from making presentations. The parties in favour of Nice must continue to tell people that the Treaty of Nice deals with European enlargement, regardless of what Deputy Sargent said President Prodi said in the past. It has been made clear at all levels that Nice is absolutely essential in order that enlargement can go ahead next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage the preparations for a declaration that might emerge from the Seville Council leading to a constitutional referendum that will make an appropriate reference to neutrality in the Constitution, in so far as that measure is within his control? </P>
      <P>It is not clear from the Taoiseach's statement following the Barcelona meeting where he stands on liberalised labour markets. Many commentators asked if the Taoiseach has a vision of social Europe or if he follows a US model of the economy that demands liberalised labour markets. That development would seriously detract from support for the Nice treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the side of a social Europe, as I always have been. I was on the Social Affairs Council, the ECOFIN Council and the European Council. At the Barcelona Council, I followed the Lisbon strategy &ndash; I was in the camp of Antonio Guterres on the social model. I see difficulties with the other models. I was fortunate enough to be president of the council in 1990 when the Social Charter was formulated and was around in 2001 when it ended. It took 11 years to pass it through the system. Compared to 15 years <Col N="619" /> ago, employers and unions at European level work far more closely together.</P>
      <P>I have said what I want to see in the declaration. I do not accept all of the reasons why it is necessary but it is inevitable that we have it. The declaration the Government will agree at Seville will reassure the public that our traditional stance on neutrality is not in conflict with any EU treaties. Our policy of military neutrality is not a matter for the Constitution because, as has long been argued by various Ministers for Foreign Affairs, the Constitution invests responsibility for decisions in relation to the defence of the State in the Oireachtas and the Government. It would not be in the best interests of the defence of the State to put terms such as neutrality and alliance into the Constitution. It is unnecessary because in order for a troop contingent to be sent abroad, the law requires that it must be part of an operation endorsed by the UN and it must be approved by the Government and the Dáil. Those measures have worked well for 40 years. I cannot remember a contentious debate in the last 25 years about the involvement of troops. We need a declaration to allay public fears on an issue where they have considerable doubts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In any situation where war has to be dealt with, authority is vested in the Government of the day. I could not imagine a difficulty arising from that, even if someone declared war on us. Existing provisions have not been contentious since the foundation of the State and I see no need to include neutrality in the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fascinating to listen to the Taoiseach saying that he does not think neutrality should be in the Constitution when he was adamant about the need for a referendum on Partnership for Peace when in Opposition. It is interesting to reflect on the two positions coming from the same person. Does the Taoiseach accept that any re-running of the Nice treaty referendum will be defeated again if he believes the three points in his reply? Does he stand over those points? </P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the outcome of the last referendum was decided by a lack of understanding. Whatever about the people who did not vote having that position, those who did vote should be given credit for going to the trouble of deciding how to vote. I would not accuse them of a lack of understanding, even if the Taoiseach does not agree with that understanding.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach stand over his statement that the legality of the declaration is not important? That will ring hollow in the ears of people who feel an attempt is being made to address their well founded fears of Ireland's military involvement in the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" />Is the Taoiseach saying that article 1.2 of the Nice treaty, setting out integration of the Western European Union, sweeping away references to it, and integrating defence into the EU, is inconsequential? That is a major issue for many people, particularly because we were not members of the Western European Union although we have since become <i>de facto</i> members because of our EU membership.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach stand over those three points? Are they arguments for the endorsement of the Nice treaty or will it be defeated again? If those are his arguments, it will be defeated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a political declaration and it is not under threat. Under Article 17 of the treaty, any decision to move to a common defence has to be approved by each member state according to its own constitutional requirements. Our constitutional requirements would involve a referendum if we were to go down that road but we are not doing that.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is going to quote me, he should quote me correctly. What I said was that if there is a political or legal imperative, there should be a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">

      <P>The advice was that there should be a referendum. When we were in Government the advice from the Attorney General was that it was not necessary just as the advice on the Nice treaty was that there should be a referendum and we held one. Deputy Quinn stated at the time that we should do it anyway and as I agreed with him at the time, I will not disagree now.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Article 17 also specifies that the security and defence policy union shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states. This includes Ireland and other neutral countries. These are both safeguards which are clearly confirmed in the Nice treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the truth and we should be fair about these matters.</P>
      <P>On the question of the research, the results show that people were confused. They did not know all the details and many became confused when they examined the texts of the Nice treaty. This is what they said to three different research groups, only one of which was the Government. The people said they required more information, which is the reason many did not vote. They were either confused, did not have sufficient information or did not fully understand. Given that we look at and accept the findings of polls every day, we must accept the opinions expressed by the people in the research.</P>
      <P>The declaration is a political declaration which makes crystal clear the existing position that Ireland's military neutrality is in no way affected by membership of the European Union. That has been the position for a long time &ndash; 30 years &ndash; and the declaration will spell that out and frame it in the best way we can put it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get one issue off the table as a lawyer and politician. Any notion of putting neutrality into the Constitution would be utter madness. It would leave every decision taken by the Government in the years ahead open to referral to the Supreme Court and we have plenty of people prepared to go to the Supreme Court at the drop of a hat. That is not the answer to our difficulties.</P>
      <P>I turn to the main issue which is the Treaty of Nice. My concern is that everything is being left to the last minute again. It is more than nine months since the failure of the referendum on the treaty and less than three months to the Seville European Council. In the next three months we will have the recess, the election and the period required to form a new Government. As of now, we have no new procedures in place in relation to the committees, including resources, no draft declaration and no domestic underpinning of the declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that because the time has not been used properly there is a huge danger we will leave ourselves exposed to a further defeat? Will he accept now that the draft declaration, which I proposed last October, should have been debated at the Committee on <Col N="622" /> European Affairs or in plenary session of the House and consideration should be given to underpinning it? I proposed as useful a White Paper on neutrality because I am totally against a constitutional change.</P>
    <P>It would also be useful to have the Defence Act amended to make it clear that involvement in the Rapid Reaction Force would require Dáil approval. One could claim this is unnecessary but only in the same way one could describe the EU declaration as unnecessary. It would clarify the issues which obviously concerned people during the last referendum. Will the Taoiseach, even at this late stage, agree that before the fall of the Government the draft declaration should be debated here or in one of the committees? Will he not at least consider the possibility of underpinning the declaration with an amendment to the Defence Act? I will circulate a copy of the Bill tomorrow to make matters easier for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not take very long to deal with this aspect. While I welcome any points of a helpful nature made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I ask him not to pretend that nothing has happened. The forum has proved to be enormously useful. It was well attended and successful and has received much interest not only in Dublin, but also at the sessions in other parts of the country and from the regional newspapers. All the deputations which appeared before it put in a great deal of effort.</P>
      <P>It is well known in the European Council and the applicant countries, many of whose ambassadors attended. The forum has been operating for six months. It has published and widely circulated its first report and the second is being prepared. It is not true, therefore, to claim nothing has happened. The European Movement and Institute of European Affairs spent the entire winter on this and invested an enormous amount of energy in it. I have seen some of the IEA's excellent booklets and papers on a range of issues for which I congratulate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union movement also produced a paper on Europe, the employers, the chambers of commerce and the farmers spent time on it this winter and many of the spring conferences devoted a section to it. It is not, therefore, just an issue in the political system. People have woken up to the fact that there is a difficulty and are taking action, which is not to say that more could not be done in terms of the issues the Deputy raises. The Government is prepared to do this. We also examined the proposals made by Deputy Quinn last year and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, responded to them <Col N="623" /> through the parliamentary procedure. An enormous amount has been done and whatever else we do, we should not create confusion which would suggest that the political system, which is in favour of Europe, is not totally behind seeing through this matter.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to make this a contentious issue, Deputy O'Keeffe's view and that of his party was that we should go straight back to the people and not bother with the Forum for Europe or a delay. The Deputy now appears to acknowledge that we need to build up this process, which is what we are endeavouring to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach hold discussions at the Barcelona meeting with the British Prime Minister on Sellafield, a matter of great concern here? My concern in this context is that there has been considerable huff and puff and talk, yet there has been an expansion of the facilities in Sellafield in recent years. Did the Taoiseach make the issue a central part of his discussion with Prime Minister Blair at Barcelona and did he receive a commitment of any kind as to its future?</P>

      <P>This is not the subject of these questions. We did not have a summit in Barcelona on Sellafield, but we did have one a few weeks earlier in 10 Downing Street where we raised the subject. We raise the matter at all our official meetings. The legal process is taking its course, arbitration is under way, the law of the sea conference and many other activities are taking place. The Deputy will be aware that the British Government's position has not moved or changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it appears unlikely to change. That is why the Attorney General, his staff and outside advisers here and in the UK have taken on an expensive, time consuming legal case. I have not got responses on this question but I assure the Deputy that on every formal occasion we will bring it up and go through it at some length. The British Government is aware of our views as are those of the Nordic countries such as Iceland and Norway, which have taken a pro-active stance in the Law of the Sea Conference. We have also made those views clear to legal sections in Europe and we will continue with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being slightly repetitious, does the Taoiseach agree that a defeat <Col N="624" /> second time round for the Nice treaty in Ireland would create an enormous impediment to enlargement as we understand it? Enlargement in some shape or form would probably proceed anyway but as a consequence Ireland would find itself politically and diplomatically isolated within the EU, with all the negative consequences that would flow from that.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is absolutely essential that the Irish people understand in a deep, comprehensive way the necessity to endorse the Nice treaty on the path to an enlarged and consolidated European Union. For any Government to achieve that objective &ndash; if it agrees with the objective &ndash; it is necessary to spell out in a comprehensive way the steps the Government will take to address the associated fears and worries; there are fears and worries as distinct from sustained political critiques. However, they are none the less real for all of that and manifest themselves as votes in ballot boxes, as we know.</P>
      <P>Against that background, does the Taoiseach recognise that as the convention in Europe starts to debate the future end shape of the European Union in terms of shared sovereignty, greater pooling of sovereignty or the loss of further levels of national autonomy currently held by states under existing treaties, an additional set of fears may well be generated between now and the autumn, when a referendum takes place on Nice? If one accepts that scenario it is important that this Administration, in the last four or five weeks before polling day, sets out clearly the steps it intends to take in relation to publishing the draft declaration and a holding statement as to what it regards as the end position of the constitutional settlement that will be the European Union after the convention has concluded and the Intergovernmental Conference comes into play. Then people will know the position of the Government and will not be fearful of pronouncements from other European heads of state. The Taoiseach should clearly indicate what the draft declaration is and whether he wants to follow that declaration with a protocol to be attached to the subsequent treaty following the intergovernmental conference. He should indicate when he will publish the legislation to give statutory obligations to the House to have a form of accountability for Ministers making decisions at Council meetings rather than a set of Standing Orders, as is proposed at present by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>A fear is a fear whether or not it is rational. These fears are impediments to enabling people to endorse the Nice treaty and they must be recognised, respected and addressed in as far as they can be. Does the Taoiseach recognise he has a unique leadership responsibility now, in the next two to three weeks, to address this in a concrete way? He may not have the opportunity over the summer and it may be too late by the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that last autumn after the failure to ratify the Nice treaty. It was <Col N="625" /> for that reason we put so much commitment and effort into the forum over the winter, as did Deputy Quinn's party. We put forward papers, we gave people time and we had speakers address a range of conferences, community organisations and other activist groups throughout the country to help sell that message. A good job has been done there.</P>
      <P>In the period of reflection we called for, we looked at the issues that concerned people. As Deputy Quinn said, there was some scaremongering to arouse fears but those fears still have to be dealt with. Three or four such issues clearly showed how we do our business here and frankly, people on the outside will not worry whether we do this by legislation or in Standing Orders once it is done. We could spend a long time preparing legislation but we could put Standing Orders in place quickly and we have already started doing that. There is far more involvement now with the Committee on European Affairs, though the Minister had already been involved long before the Nice treaty referendum, attending the committee before and since. I am not sure if that affected the vote one way or the other but we have started that process and will continue it. Across Departments we have increased resources to communicate about Europe. All those measures are in place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn said we must put some effort into this and we should try to get agreement on the declaration. I have some reservations. As soon as I mention the declaration, to go back to Deputy Sargent's point, things immediately changed. People called for a declaration but as soon as I said we would have a declaration&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has provided this House with a comprehensive account of the context in which this issue arose at the Barcelona European Council meeting.</P>
      <P>In summary, and in the context of the Government's commitment to EU enlargement and to the ratification of the Nice treaty by the end of the year, the Taoiseach signalled to his European counterparts that the Government would seek a declaration from the Seville European Council which will confirm that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is not affected by the treaties.</P>
      <P>Our EU partners responded positively to the Taoiseach's statement. The conclusions of the European Council welcomed the approach outlined and reiterated the Council's willingness to contribute in every possible way to supporting the Government. Work will proceed on the drafting of a declaration with a view to consideration by the incoming Government.</P>
      <P>I echo the Taoiseach's statement that the declaration forms only part of the Government's overall strategy towards addressing the factors which lay behind the defeat of the Nice treaty referendum. Steps have also been taken to provide for better Oireachtas scrutiny of EU matters and, through the Forum on Europe, to have a national debate on: &ldquo;issues relevant to Ireland's membership of an enlarging Union and to consider the range of topics arising in the context of the debate on the Future of Europe.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, we have already spoken about the Nice treaty. The Minister should be specific on a number of issues. Is it the right approach to go off to Barcelona and talk about a draft that has not even been discussed here or seen by the Committee on European Affairs? Does he accept that there is a need to underpin measures for the draft? These should not be written off as unnecessary in the same way the draft was by some people when I proposed it last October. We are dealing with perceptions <Col N="627" /> here and from that point of view does he not see the need for underpinning measures like an amendment to the Defence Act?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the procedures in relation to the democratic deficit and the use of the committees should now be in place? They are not in place and the extra resources needed are not in place. Is it correct that the Minister for Finance has drawn a line and refused to make any extra resources available? The committees could have been beefed up in the meantime and could be seen as operational. Does the Minister not see my frustration on this issue? I want to see these changes in place and working when we go to the people in the autumn. I hope the Government will be led by Fine Gael, but we will support the next referendum even if we are not in power. Would we not have a much better chance of success if we went to the people with the package in place and fully operational, having being discussed and debated? The delays in the Government's approach mean that too much is being left to chance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of the Taoiseach referring to a draft at the European Council in Barcelona. He set out his thinking and the Government's approach so he could obtain a broad measure of agreement from his counterparts before proceeding along the lines indicated. It was a prudent, proper and correct course of action. While some preliminary work has been done, as the Taoiseach said, the process needs to be taken further. The chairman of the forum provided useful guidance on future work on the declaration in his summing up last Thursday. It is not correct to suggest that the Taoiseach went to Barcelona with a draft which had not been referred to the Dáil. He explained his broad approach and sought approval and consensus among the Heads of Government so he could proceed with an agreed approach with the full support of the European Council in Seville in June.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed among the Whips that the new committee arrangements should be in place when the new Dáil convenes after the general election. This is a sensible proposal, as we know what the new arrangements are and will be ready to implement them a few weeks after the election. The detailed work of the Whips needs to be acknowledged and it is good that there is broad recognition among Members of the need to improve working arrangements and increase public awareness and ownership of parliamentary proceedings. The question of proper committee scrutiny of European Union matters is important in the context of the overall Oireachtas reform package. Certain decisions on reform which have been taken will be implemented when the House reconvenes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a contentious or party political point to say that we are all anxious to monitor and prioritise the work of the EU. Committees need to be properly informed by Departments when <Col N="628" /> proposals emanate from the European Commission, Council or Parliament on issues which have a direct bearing on or relevance to this country. The timescale of a measure can vary depending on its subject matter. We will be able to monitor measures in a manner which compares favourably with arrangements in other EU parliaments, while not limiting the Executive's capacity to negotiate. The sensible, accountable and transparent arrangements which have been reached by the Whips will incorporate Union matters as an integral part of national debate, which is what is required. We can put the Treaty of Nice to the people before the end of the year with greater confidence if we have ensured that citizens recognise the day to day importance of European issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Security Council, Ireland has taken an active part in attempts to resolve the crisis in Iraq and to promote peace in the Middle East. Our contact with the US Administration has not led to an indication that the US is considering military action in Iraq in the near future. In his meeting with the Taoiseach, President Bush expressed grave concern at Iraq's defiance of Security Council resolutions, the threat posed by Iraqi efforts to develop chemical and biological weapons and its refusal to co-operate with the UN disarmament mission. Mr. Bush indicated, however, that the US has no immediate plans for military action.</P>
      <P>The US has indicated that it is reviewing its policy on Iraq, but its efforts will continue to be focused on achieving Security Council agreement on the reform of sanctions and the return of UN arms inspectors. The Taoiseach made the general point that diplomatic options should be fully exhausted before engaging in an extension of the use of military force and that the primary responsibility for resolving international issues lies with the United Nations. Following the meeting, the Taoiseach said that President Bush wants to ensure that the justice, peace and well-being of the world is protected and that he is prepared to make every necessary effort to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government continues to insist that Iraq abides by Security Council resolutions and allows the return of UN weapons inspectors as the <Col N="629" /> quickest and most appropriate way of achieving a resolution of the current situation. The Government believes that diplomatic options have not been exhausted and is seriously concerned by the possible use of military force. Primary responsibility for resolving international crises rests with the United Nations and in this regard I welcome the resumption of its dialogue with Iraq. The Government considers that multilateral co-operation in the UN on the application of sanctions remains the best approach in tackling the threat from Iraq.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian situation in Iraq continues to be of deep concern. In addition to seeking Iraq's full co-operation with the United Nations, the Government will continue its efforts in the Security Council to bring about a reform of sanctions to address suffering and to eliminate restrictions on humanitarian and essential infrastructural goods entering Iraq. Ireland will work with its EU partners and others in the international community to ensure that tensions are resolved without recourse to military action.</P>
    <P>Ireland was among the countries which voted in favour of Security Council Resolution 1397, which for the first time referred to a Palestinian state alongside Israel. We shall continue to work for an active role in promoting a just and lasting solution. The position of the European Union was stated most recently by the European Council at Barcelona on 16 March. The declaration sets out clearly the EU's expectations of both parties, outlines the steps necessary to achieve peace and expresses support for recent initiatives, including Resolution 1397, the ideas of Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and the renewed engagement of the US special envoy, General Zinni.</P>
    <P>The EU continues to engage actively with the relevant major parties. It is disturbing that there is violence in the Middle East at a time when new initiatives are being considered by the UN, the EU and the Arab League, which is holding a summit meeting in Beirut today. I hold out hope for progress, however, and do not accept that the region is drifting towards war. I regret that the Israeli authorities have imposed conditions which resulted in President Arafat being unable to attend today's meeting. I assure the House that all efforts towards peace in the UN, the EU or other international fora will have Ireland's full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only put a few brief questions to the Minister, as my time is limited. I used the phrase &ldquo;the drift to war&rdquo; in my question, as I believe that such a drift is evident. In his reply, the Minister made reference to Mr. Bush's suggestion during a meeting with the Taoiseach that the US is not contemplating military action in the short-term. Is the Minister aware that this was contradicted by senior spokespersons within 24 hours of the meeting? Is he familiar with Mr. Rumsfeld's statement that the inspectorate which will visit Iraq should be allowed open and uncon<Col N="630" /> ditional access to all installations, including palaces? The conditions are almost impossible to fulfil. Has the Government offered to compose the inspectorate in a manner that may be acceptable to all concerned, as a net contribution to Kofi Annan's talks with the Iraqi authorities? The Minister made detailed reference in his reply to the Taoiseach's discussions with Mr. Bush. Was the nuclear posture review raised at the meeting, bearing in mind that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is one of the hallmarks of Irish foreign policy? What has happened to Javier Solana's initiative in the Middle East? Where has he gone? Is the Minister aware that there is a feeling in the Middle East that the European Union has deserted it yet again and left it to the United States to recover its interests?</P>

      <P>On the Iraqi case, unfortunately I did not attend the meeting with the Taoiseach and President Bush on the day, but my recollection from the reports of the meeting were that it concentrated mainly on Northern Ireland and on the war against terrorism. I do not recall in the reports, a reference to our well-established position on disarmament and our views on nuclear proliferation and the concerns we would have about any moves that would seek to modify the ABM treaty as a basis upon which we can ensure a strategic reduction in these weapons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. I am making the point that while there was a short time for these discussions there was only a short time for those discussions also and it was not possible to raise that issue. The US will be well aware of the Irish position on these matters and our traditional position on disarmament. In regard to the situation in Iraq, the Deputy referred to the fact that senior spokespersons contradicted what their own president had said. That is a matter to be taken up with the US Administration. We are reporting faithfully the conversation the Taoiseach had with the US President. We are satisfied from official contacts and others that there is not an imminent threat of military action on Iraq by the United States. There is a preparedness to allow the efforts of UN Secretary General to continue where the Iraqis have renewed contact with the Secretary General in relation to arms inspections. There will be a meeting of the Security Council in relation to these contacts before the UN Secretary General meets them again in April. We support this initiative by the Secretary General We will support any recommendation from him which he believes would help advance the issue, once it does not affect the independence of Hans Blix and his team. What we will seek is that the Iraqis comply with the resolution. That is the basis upon which the inspections must take place. A resolution of this matter, consistent with Security Council resolutions is the requirement of <Col N="631" /> international law regardless of anyone else's interpretation of it. If Hans Blix can satisfy the Security Council that he can complete his mandate, based on what one would hope would be a successful outcome to discussions between the Secretary General and the Iraqi regime, the Irish Government would be happy with that. From our point of view it is important that the initiative by the Secretary General has the full support of everyone and that he is given time and space in which to successfully conclude discussions with them. He has our support and I hope he is successful in his efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Iraq, I accept there is no imminent military action planned by the Americans. They are obviously putting a strategy in place, establishing bases, looking at the situation in relation to the Kurds in the North and the Shi'ites in the South and how they can best put together a package to overthrow Saddam Hussein for whom I have no sympathy whatever. He is one of the worst tyrants the world has seen. I am concerned about where we stand in all of this. I do not believe we should mislead the Americans. If action is taken against Iraq will our support for any such action be based on whether such action is under a resolution of the United Nations? If that is so, did the Taoiseach make that clear to President Bush when he spoke with him? I have been trying to get an answer to that question and with all due respect to the Taoiseach, he seems to have evaded answering it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Middle East &ndash; this is linked because the Americans may have some interest in having a resolution of the Middle East problem before it actually moves on Iraq &ndash; where do we stand from the point of view of wholesale slaughter from the forces of Israel? Is there a danger that, because of historic and other reasons, the Prime Minister is being treated with kid gloves? That is not to say President Arafat and his people are angels either but certainly one expects from a State some adherence to international law. I do not see any such adherence by the forces of Israel at present. Is there any move to have the EU adopt a stronger role? This could be done from the point of view of the diplomatic and political level and, if necessary, by a threat of trade sanctions. Given that Mr. Sharon does not listen to reason from anybody, if there were trade sanctions against the country it might affect the issue. Will there be a tougher and stronger role to try to bring him to his senses and, in particular, in relation to disgraceful incidents such as refusing to allow President Arafat to go to the Arab League Summit. It is outrageous that they should carry on in that fashion.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the special relationship between Israel and the United States precludes the US from playing an important and effective role in the region.

      <P>I welcome the return of presidential envoy, Mr. Anthony Zinni to the region to seek ways to bring the violence to an end and to restart negotiations. Mr. Javier Solana is in Beirut today. The objective reality is that while we are in a very difficult situation in the Middle East there is no doubt that in the past 12 to 18 months, particularly since his involvement on the Mitchell Commission which came forward with the Mitchell report &ndash; there were three Europeans on that commission &ndash;  the European Union is seen as an important player in trying to help these two parties resolve this historic problem. The basic issue is that if there is no basis of trust between the Palestinians and the Israelis then no amount of outside facilitation will resolve that problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards sanctions, there is an issue in relation to disputes and arbitration which is taking place between the European Union and Israel in regard to products coming out of the settlements which are not in accordance with the rules of origin procedures. Commissioner Patten is pursuing that issue vigorously within existing regulations. In relation to Iraq, none of the existing UN Security Council regulations explicitly permits military action in the event that Iraq is considered to be in breach of the Gulf War ceasefire arrangements. In the view of the Government it would be desirable that the Security Council decide whether Iraq's continued non-compliance with the Security Council resolutions would permit the use of military action against Iraq. As regards any US action that would be taken, in the leader position there, it would be up to the United States Government to provide its own justification under international law for taking any military action. From our point of view, the European Union position on Iraq is that we are concerned at Iraq's non-compliance. At the meeting between the EU and the Gulf Co-operation Council on 28 February, the EU called for Iraq to implement fully and immediately all UN Security Council resolutions and to co-operate in all respects with the UN and its subsidiary bodies in order to allow for the suspension and, in due course, the lifting of sanctions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware Mrs. Robinson announced on 18 March that she will leave the Office of the High Commissioner at the end of her current term. The Taoiseach issued a statement on behalf of the Government praising Mrs. Robinson's achievements as High Commissioner. Mrs. Robinson has expressed warm appreciation for this statement.</P>
      <P>Ireland backed Mrs. Robinson when she sought the post of High Commissioner in 1997 and she would have been confident of receiving our renewed support had she decided to let her name go forward again.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Robinson's term of office as High Commissioner has been marked with distinction. She pursued the promotion and protection of human rights with the utmost vigour. She saw those rights as universal and indivisible and did not flinch from drawing attention to and condemning violations wherever they occurred.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Robinson was the driving force behind the World Conference Against Racism, held in Durban, South Africa last year. For the first time, on this issue of crucial importance to societies throughout the world, agreement was reached on an outcome document. This document, the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, will provide a solid basis for work on a global scale to combat the scourges of racism and xenophobia. It was not easy to achieve this outcome and the success of the conference was due in large part to Mrs. Robinson's tenacity and clear vision in looking beyond particular grievances to the wider picture. Mrs. Robinson has demonstrated strict independence in the execution of her responsibilities. The Government has respected that independence and regarded any decision on whether Mrs. Robinson would seek a further term of office as a matter between her and the Secretary General. The Government, therefore, had no discussions with Mrs. Robinson on this matter, neither did the Government seek to raise the issue with other countries.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Robinson's tireless advocacy of human rights has enhanced the prestige of the office of the High Commissioner and, of course, has reflected well on her own country. I want to place on record today the Government's appreciation of her work. I also wish her well for the future. We may be sure that her voice will continue to be heard and will not be lost to the victims, the marginalised and the vulnerable, on whose behalf she has spoken so effectively.</P>

I appreciate that there could be no question of the Government's interfering in the performance of her duties. She is absolutely independent, and rightly so.

      <P>It is totally unwarranted, without substantiation or evidence and contrary to the facts for Deputy O'Keeffe to suggest the Government would not, did not and does not support the High Commissioner in her job.

      <P>The constitutional balance struck in the Good Friday Agreement is a careful and sensitive one. In enshrining the principle of consent, and in recognising it is the current wish of a majority of people in Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom, the Agreement also puts in place a mechanism through which, when the time is right, support for a united Ireland can be measured and through which effect can be given to any resulting vote in favour of change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, Mr. David Trimble has recently proposed that a poll on the constitutional question should be held at an early date. In doing <Col N="636" /> so, he has suggested that it might be timed to coincide with the Assembly elections due to be held on 1 May 2003.</P>
    <P>While the Agreement enables the Secretary of State to direct the holding of a such a poll, it leaves him with discretion as to its timing. Specifically, it states that he shall use his power &ldquo;if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a United Ireland&rdquo;. I do not believe such an outcome is likely at present. Furthermore, I share fully the concern, as expressed by the Taoiseach, that a decision to hold a poll in the short-term would be a serious distraction from our efforts to achieve implementation in full of the Good Friday Agreement. This must continue to be our highest priority in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>The institutions are working effectively and a new beginning in policing is under way. Important steps have been taken on decommissioning and demilitarisation. Progress is being made across the range of issues. However, even the most optimistic observer will acknowledge that it will take us years, not months, to ensure the new arrangements under the Agreement are firmly rooted and can grow and flourish as its authors envisaged.</P>
    <P>To continue to advance towards our goal, we need a sustained period of stability and calm. The precipitate holding of a poll would, inevitably, be divisive and polarising at a time when we are trying to consolidate support for the principles the Agreement enshrines &ndash; partnership, equality, reconciliation and mutual respect.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is easy to understand why Mr. David Trimble would want a referendum coinciding with elections next year? He probably has in mind a chapel gate election like that called by Lord Brookeborough in 1949. Does the Minister agree that any such suggestion is a recipe for instability and would raise the political temperature to a dangerously high level? I agree with the Minister that what is required is a bedding down of the new partnership institutions in the North and between North and South and that the leaders of the Northern Ireland Executive can prove their capacity to work together in Government and cope with the political, social, economic, cultural and other problems of Northern Ireland and thereby bringing about reconciliation. Does the Minister agree this is the way forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister join with me in condemning those who talk irresponsibly of a sort of rabbit solution to the problem whereby nationalists would outbreed unionists? Such suggestions are dangerously irresponsible and will he join me in <Col N="637" /> disowning people who make them? While the Minister, like myself, believes in a united Ireland brought about by agreement some time in the future, does he agree that no outcome is inevitable? The future depends on people within the North and in the North and South working together in partnership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the sentiments Deputy Currie has expressed and with all he has had to say. The Good Friday Agreement is the culmination of a huge amount of work over many years by many people. The thinking that came into it was to try to break out of this unfortunate prison in which Northern Ireland politics has been locked for too long, namely the zero-sum mentality in which there are either winners or losers, and move towards a creative, modern and pluralist solution to counter this majoritarian type of thinking which has served, and will serve, both communities very poorly.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in regard to the fascination with demographic analysis. The question of referring to the possibility of how a nationalist majority may emerge is politically primitive and in no way should be regarded as providing the basis for stability, peace and prosperity on the island. I also agree with the Deputy that the focus of the work at hand &ndash; we have plenty of work to do &ndash; is on the need to effect reconciliation between a deeply divided society and on the recognition that all must and can play their part. We have agreed to the route map by which we can achieve peace and reconciliation without determining the ultimate destination or outcome. That will be a matter based on the principles of self-determination and consent on which we are all agreed. Therefore, trying to reiterate, redefine or re-engage on that particular question, which is an unusual principle, serves no useful purpose and would, as the Deputy said from his experience and knowledge of the situation, lead only to an unnecessary heightening of tensions and a reversion, in pure psychological terms as well as everything else, to a tribal siege mentality which has no part to play in the outworking of the Good Friday Agreement which provides us all with the opportunity to move beyond the zero-sum mentality and find a winner in all situations, rather than a winner takes all situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 34, 67 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned at the conduct of the presidential election in Zimbabwe in which the incumbent President, Robert Mugabe, secured victory.</P>
      <P>I condemn unreservedly the widespread political violence and intimidation which preceded the election. While acts of violence were perpetrated by both sides, it was clear that the majority of incidents were directed at members of the MDC opposition party. The conduct of the Government in the run-up to the election was unacceptable. There is strong evidence of collusion between the Government, the security forces and Zanu-PF youth brigades in the harassment and assault of opposition officials, supporters, and indeed, potential supporters.</P>
      <P>I am further concerned at the manner in which the polling process itself was conducted. There were too few polling stations in densely populated urban areas where people had to queue for hours to vote. This problem was most prevalent in areas where the opposition is known to have strong support. In spite of the High Court decision to allow polling stations to remain open for a third day of voting, many voters were denied their right to vote. There were many other instances where the electoral process was manipulated to favour the incumbent candidate, Robert Mugabe, and I condemn all such acts.</P>
      <P>In short, it is impossible to conclude that the election in Zimbabwe was free and fair. Under such frustrating circumstances, the citizens of Zimbabwe are to be commended for their peaceful conduct during polling and the civil and democratic will displayed through the large voter turnout. It is highly regrettable that President Mugabe has continued his campaign of vilification against the opposition party candidate following his recent inauguration, with formal charges of treason now being brought against MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has always taken a strong forward position in the formation of EU policy in relation to the actions of the Government of Zimbabwe. As <Col N="639" /> Deputies will be aware, in February 2001 the EU decided to enter into a dialogue with the Zimbabwean Government. During that dialogue we appealed to the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure an end to the violence and intimidation and to ensure full respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law. Regrettably, by the February 2002 meeting of the General Affairs Council, it was clear that the approach of the Zimbabwean Government to consultations with the EU was unproductive and political violence in Zimbabwe was continuing. Therefore, on 18 February 2002, the Council decided to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe under Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement, as a result of its failure, <i>inter alia</i>, to end political violence and protect human rights. The targeted sanctions include an asset freeze and travel ban on senior Zimbabwean officials, a ban on arms exports to Zimbabwe and a ban on the export of equipment that could be used for repressive purposes in Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Council, in the face of persistent efforts by the Zimbabwean Government to obstruct EU election observers, decided to withdraw that part of the observer team which it had been able to deploy in Zimbabwe. At the European Council meeting in Barcelona earlier this month, it was agreed that we would continue to monitor closely events in Zimbabwe following the election which we agreed was neither free nor fair. The EU will send a high level troika to confer with countries of the Southern Africa Development Community about our concerns regarding Zimbabwe. I welcome the decision of the Commonwealth to suspend Zimbabwe for one year based on the damning conclusions of its election observer team.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>Mugabe is a tyrant and a fraud and I think that is accepted internationally at this stage. His election was clearly unacceptable, undemocratic and fraudulent. I understand the Minister's position. He said Ireland condemns the election but the question is, what can we do about it? I am cognisant of the fact that thousands of our citizens are, to some degree, hostages in that unfortunate country. Realistically, what can we do to bring home to Mugabe that he cannot be allowed to continue in power on the basis of this fraudulent election? What can we do through the European Union, in particular, and the United Nations in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken prompt action in the Department to ensure that Ireland is in compliance with the EU regulation and the Council common position regarding sanctions against Zimbabwe. Targeted sanctions include an asset freeze, as I have said, and a travel ban on named Zimbabwean officials as well as a ban on arms exports and the export of equipment. We have brought the list of named individuals to the attention of the Central Bank and requested that it <Col N="640" /> inform all financial institutions to freeze any funds held by those listed.</P>
      <P>We have also brought the EU regulations to the attention of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the licensing authority for the export of military goods, and requested that the Department ensure that Ireland is in compliance with the relevant measures. Measures have been taken by the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to put in place the necessary statutory instruments to enable Ireland to impose penalties where the EU regulation has been infringed. Our own consular section is aware of the travel ban provisions in the Council common position and is taking the appropriate steps to ensure it is given effect in this State. While all licensed financial institutions have not yet reported to the Central Bank, no accounts have been identified to date.</P>
      <P>On what further possible measures are being considered by the European Union, we will be open to considering any constructive suggestions for further measures which may emerge at EU meetings. One possibility is to extend the list of individuals targeted by the asset freeze and visa ban adopted at the GAC on 18 February. Beyond this, it is difficult to know at present what further sanctions can be applied. It is generally agreed that economic sanctions would hurt the ordinary people of Zimbabwe. It is too early to predict the long-term effects of the election result and the EU sanctions already imposed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the efforts of President Mbeki of South Africa to mediate in the current political conflict. It is possible that an acceptable solution to the crisis could be found. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor the situation very carefully.</P>
      <P>Regarding our own people there, we are aware that people with dual Irish and Zimbabwean nationality have recently been obliged to rescind their Irish citizenship in order to retain their citizenship of Zimbabwe. Deputies can be assured that Irish people who have rescinded their citizenship of Ireland will be treated with the utmost understanding by my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the last part of the Minister's reply. Does he have a view on whether there is a role for the UN Security Council in relation to what is happening in Zimbabwe and does he believe that, in the medium-term, what is happening there could lead to instability in southern Africa? Is the Minister willing to promote the idea of an open and frank debate in the UN Security Council on the issue of President Mugabe and the potential instability in southern Africa as a result of elections which were clearly unfair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Security Council is limited in its considerations to matters where there are <Col N="641" /> threats to international peace and security, existing conflicts or imminent conflicts. The issue raised is that of a fraudulent election. We need to ensure the international community brings all possible authority and pressure to bear on Mr. Mugabe to recognise that the democratic will of the people has not been established because the elections were not free or fair. Discussions led by President Mbeki continue to take place and we wish him well in his efforts. He may be in a position to influence and shape events. We hope that he can, but one would not be overly optimistic based on the inauguration speech of President Mugabe and his reaction to the opposition. He has threatened the opposition and charged the main opposition leader with treason. I am not aware that this issue is being considered by the presidency of the Security Council, or if it is regarded as a matter that is at a stage which would enable the council to deal with it. I will inquire of our UN ambassador as to what the up to date position is. We can then see what efforts can be made or what existing efforts can be supplemented under the sanctions issue. There is a travel ban on members of that Government.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister share the concerns that attitudes towards Mr. Mugabe seem to have polarised along black and white lines? If, in response to my colleague, the Minister proceeds through the Security Council, could the prime objective be to ensure that this polarisation does not occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there was a semblance of that. The Commonwealth, in so far as it has any bearing on events, expelled Zimbabwe from the organisation for one year. The Commonwealth comprises countries of differing racial compositions. That was a counter balance to indications that other African leaders were taking Mr. Mugabe's propagandist view of this being a neo-colonial conspiracy against him rather than the absence of free and fair elections. It was a good means of killing that notion. There is evidence that opposition to him does not break down along racial lines and that is good. All Governments who are committed to democratic values, regardless of their racial composition, are consistent in acknowledging reports from election observers that this was not a free and fair election and that Mr. Mugabe must bear the consequences.</P>

      <P>The Government is not aware of any proposal to seek a Security Council mandate to extend the military action in Afghanistan to other countries. The Government very much hopes that there will be no extension of military action beyond that undertaken in Afghanistan. We regard the use of military force as a matter of absolute last resort and will make every effort to ensure that any further effort to eradicate international terrorism is achieved through peaceful means. As the Deputy will be aware, the UN has primary responsibility for resolving international crises. We consider that multilateral co-operation remains the best approach in tackling international terrorism and the root causes of conflict and terrorism including poverty, injustice, abuse of human rights and the proliferation of small arms. Ireland will continue to work to this end.</P>

The Minister will be aware that in both cases there have been unilateral statements from the United States about what it hopes to do. Somalia is the most urgent case. I want to be generous to our officials who managed to have Somalia brought to the top of the agenda during the Irish presidency of the Security Council. Ordinary Somali citizens are currently suffering in near famine conditions in expectation of a strike against their country. Such a strike is not covered by any UN resolution.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The core point of the Deputy's question dealt with the remit and existing legal basis of the Security Council resolutions in respect of possible military action against countries other than Afghanistan. Security Council Resolution 1368 of 12 September 2001 recognised the attacks as a threat to international peace and security. The resolution called &ldquo;on all States to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks and stresses that those responsible for <Col N="643" /> aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these acts will be held accountable&rdquo;. If evidence were forthcoming that the Governments of one or more states were involved in harbouring those involved in the atrocities of 11 September 2001, then those Governments would also be held accountable under the terms of Resolution 1368. If they were to refuse to remove the threat to international peace and security posed by their support for international terrorism, they would find themselves potentially liable to international action. As I said, we regard the use of military force as a matter of absolute last resort and will make every effort to ensure that any further effort to eradicate international terrorism is achieved through peaceful means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now come to the nub of the matter. Resolution 1368 was quoted by the Minister. The construction of that resolution is such that it is open-ended and permits action anywhere a threat is perceived. What demonstration of a willingness to provide evidence has been shown to the Minister? What evidence is forthcoming? If the evidence requirement is removed from Resolution 1368, it is an open-ended permission to strike anywhere in the world. The only restraint in it is the requirement for evidence to be forthcoming. Has the evidence been forthcoming? Who has seen the evidence? Has Ireland, as a member of the Security Council, been offered convincing evidence? I gave examples of threats being made against Somalia and Yemen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no military action against those states. Were action to be taken, it would have to be taken against states &ldquo;responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these acts [of 11 September]&rdquo;. If Governments were involved in harbouring those involved in the atrocities &ndash; and evidence would have to be produced to satisfy the international community &ndash; they would be held accountable under the terms of the resolution. If they were found to be so harbouring, they must be given the opportunity to hand over those involved. The Taliban refused to hand over members of the al-Qaeda network and the action taken was within the terms of the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of my interpretation providing a <i>carte blanche</i> for action without evidence. Under the terms of the resolution, those who harbour, support, aid or abet those responsible for the 11 September attacks find themselves open to the possible threat of military action. That would be within international law and the evidence to be provided would be to confirm that the legal basis exists for military action. We would hope, of course, not to get to that point. I am aware of statements that were made. We talk of the primacy of the United Nations and those are the <Col N="644" /> terms on which we expect the evidence to be provided for any military action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the UN Security Council presidency prioritising this issue? Does the Minister agree that if ever there was an example of an issue on which the Security Council should be leading from the front, it is the war on terrorism internationally? Is Ireland, as a member of the council, pushing for an open ended debate on this issue so that we can lead the way in policy instead of allowing the United States to act first and then seek a mandate from the Security Council? It should be the other way round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The United States is not determining the council's policy, which is set out in its unanimous resolutions. They relate to the circumstances in which military action can be taken and the financing of terrorism. That work is carried on through a United Nations committee which is ensuring that all countries comply and it provides assistance to those who do not have the innate capacity to comply with resolutions regarding the financing of terrorism.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to an open ended debate, and we can have all the debates we want, but the legal basis for military action was grounded in international law in Resolution 1368 and those are the circumstances in which any further military action can be taken. I have clearly expressed the Government's view of what those circumstances have to be and the evidential basis for it. It is not a question of being dictated to by any individual state, but of adhering to the legal basis for the fight against terrorism provided by the two resolutions which we fully support, subscribe to and are working to implement, as all members of the international community are obliged to under the UN charter.</P>

      <P>In May 2000, Deloitte &amp; Touche was requested by my Department to undertake a review of procurement practices within Ireland Aid. While this report dealt mainly with controls over procurement, which it found are adequate, properly applied in accordance with the relevant guidelines and directives and effective in practice, it referred in passing to the issue of staffing arrangements in the context of the expanding aid programme. The consultants said their discussions pointed to a need for significant changes in the manner in which Ireland Aid is managed and staffed. The lack of long-term career paths for development professionals under the current arrangements seemed to them to undermine the capacity of Ireland Aid to develop structures required to meet the challenges posed by pro<Col N="645" /> jected future growth in funding. While recommendations as to appropriate structural changes were outside the scope of their assignment, the consultants saw urgent implementation of necessary change as a priority.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid is fully seized of the importance of creating long-term career paths for development professionals and has been engaged in discussions on this subject with the Department of Finance. The objective is to achieve arrangements under which professional staff would be given, <i>inter alia</i>, longer contracts and a new grading structure. Some progress is being made in this respect. This is also one of the issues with which the review of Ireland Aid has concerned itself. The committee's report, which has been published this morning, makes a number of recommendations in relation to the management of the programme which I commend to the Deputy's attention. The Government accepts these recommendations and steps will be taken to implement them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 38 to 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks the removal of the subsection dealing with the application for a PRSA product containing the phrase &ldquo;have any duty to any contributor regarding the investment performance of a PRSA product.&rdquo;  This refers to the provider of a personal retirement savings account, in relation to the preparation that is made and the management of a product, having a duty regarding investment. Amendment No. 16 refers to &ldquo;an investment profile consistent with equalling the best known market indices which measure growth in value of equities, property and other investment products.&rdquo;  The other amendments to be discussed here, and mostly in my <Col N="647" /> name, refer to the investment performance of a PRSA product.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental issue because from the outset we should be putting down a marker for providers of these products. It is not a question, as was said on Committee Stage and as the Bill states, of a provider simply mismanaging the details of the administration of a product, but the placing of a prudential duty on providers towards contributors in relation to the performance of investments by reference to the highest possible standards. We are all familiar with recent investment history, particularly over the past two years. We saw the downturn in the United States in late 2000, which accelerated after the inauguration of President Bush, and there was a devastating setback in many IT and high-tech stocks and equities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman:</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that we are on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there are seven amendments in this grouping.</P>
      <P>Certain fund managers saw it as part of their duty to make changes to a portfolio early in the developments to which I have just referred, particularly the downturn sparked by the problems in the United States and which accelerated greatly after the devastating events of 11 September. Many fund managers saw it as their duty to try to change funds distribution on that basis and this is an area in which pensioners and contributors to PRSAs will have tremendous interest as the years pass. They will want their savings to be managed in accordance with the highest possible standards in markets. The other amendments make the same point and one of them also refers to growth in national income.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not accept any of these amendments on Committee Stage but it is a reasonable requirement that we have reference to the highest standards of performance, whether it is the ISEQ or the NASDAQ, and the best performing investment managers in terms of savings products.</P>
      <P>I do not normally agree with Senator Shane Ross. His economic views and mine are at opposite ends of the spectrum but he made some telling points about the management of funds and the way people have been bitterly let down. We have all had constituents coming to us complaining about endowment products in particular on which they were guaranteed &euro;11,000 but which are at a miserable &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000, with little time remaining. I am trying to guard against that and I ask the Minister to take a strong stance on behalf of workers and pensioners and include a reference, at least in one key part of the Bill, to measuring the performance of funds according to the highest standards in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled amendment No. 39. I come at this issue in a slightly different <Col N="648" /> way to Deputy Broughan. One of the functions of the board set out in the new section 117 should include some reference to performance. The board is the competent authority to examine in an independent and objective way the performance of PRSA providers and other companies which provide similar pension cover because they represent all the players in the industry and those who obtain this cover. Notwithstanding any difficulties that may arise in terms of legal challenges to the board's ruling, all I ask in my amendment is to give the board, as an additional function, power to publish an annual report on the investment performance of the different providers in such a way as to allow some kind of comparative study of the performance.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage and in our discussions last week in committee, companies frequently compete against each other on the basis of their own figures. The first time I was asked to buy a particular product I was told by the provider that this particular company had achieved an excellent performance over the past five years, and that it was at the top of the pile. Some authority or body should examine the performance over a period of time and come to a conclusion as to who did and did not do well because of the nature of the investment portfolio. If the Pensions Board gave the public that information rather than the companies, it would greatly enhance the level of accountability in this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister raised an interesting point on Committee Stage. A case could arise where another company could challenge the findings of the report of the Pensions Board. I do not believe that would happen if the facts of the matter were set out in terms of the performance of each of the providers. That would be a useful way to proceed in terms of giving information to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a good discussion on this issue on Committee Stage and for the reasons I outlined then, I cannot accept the amendments. The same thread runs through the various amendments. One of the reasons we have included strict disclosure requirements is to put an onus on the PRSA provider to give the contributor regular updates on his or her pension investment. They came mainly through the statement of reasonable projection and also statements on the actual value of the investment. We are trying to put the duty of care on the PRSA provider and the strong advice to me is that is the correct procedure. We want to make clear that it would not be appropriate for either the Pensions Board or the Revenue Commissioners to give a guarantee in relation to the PRSA investment. That is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agreed on Committee Stage that this area merits further examination and it is on the agenda of the Pensions Board to examine the issue of protecting the contributor in relation to investments generally, not just in PRSAs. This issue is currently being examined at EU level in the con<Col N="649" /> text of a draft directive on the activities of institutions for occupational or retirement provisions. Any future policy we might implement here would be very much influenced by developments and experience at EU level, and we will closely examine that particular issue. Future arrangements which we have to examine include the responsibility of the trustees in the case of occupational pension schemes, and of PRSA providers in the context of PRSAs. It is their responsibility and we should not undermine that in any way.</P>
    <P>It is the strong view of the Department that we must have more transparency in this area through, for instance, the introduction of investment principles relating to the level of risk, portfolio diversification and charging structures. We will ensure this is formalised through investment mandates or contracts between the trustees and the investment managers.</P>
    <P>At the core of what we are doing is putting the duty of care on the PRSA provider, not on the Pensions Board or the Revenue Commissioners because, in effect, we would be underwriting a guarantee. The Deputy may say he is not proposing that we go that far but the strong advice given to us is that would be the net result of what he is proposing which would, in effect, give some succour to people in terms of their investment. That is not the way it operates. If we were to do that, we would defeat the purpose of this legislation and not bring more people into this market. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>&mdash;in accepting all the amendments related to the introduction of a new system, PRSAs, and the putting in place of a pensions ombudsman, which are at the core of this Bill. It would be reasonable, however, for the Minister to accept amendment No. 38 in my name and amendment No. 39 in the name of Deputy Hayes. All we propose in those amendments is that the board would be obliged to publish ongoing reviews. Such reviews would enable a <Col N="650" /> young person setting out in life to compare a PRSA product from a service provider with a recent review of such products by the Pensions Board to ascertain who are the best providers of such products, who have the highest standards, who gets the best results, which fund managers perform the best and which providers' products match the best performing market indices such as the FTSE or ISEQ. This is a reasonable demand sought by myself and Deputy Hayes. I put the case for the provision of such a review by the Pensions Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a point about guarantees, but no guarantee is sought in respect of my amendment No. 39 or Deputy Broughan's amendment No. 38. It would be a natural follow on for the board, which grants the licences, in consultation with the Revenue which gives an element of guarantee in respect of the people who end up with these licences, to ensure that some work could be published which would set out the performances of the different companies. Deputy Broughan is right.</P>
      <P>Where does a person in his or her late 20s or early 30s, who decides to put aside part of his or her salary for a rainy day, go? That is what we are trying to provide for in the Bill, a new culture of savings among a cohort of people in the labour force who currently do not make any provision for savings. At present they can only go to the different providers. They cannot go to an independent body which would set out the performances of the different providers.</P>
      <P>I do not think there will be a major difference in performance from one provider to the next. Much of the regulations we are putting into the Bill will ensure a level playing pitch for the different providers. I do not think there will be great variety in the profitability of any of these products. We are not looking for guarantees but for a statement of performance. The body to do that, acting as an independent voice outside the industry and representing the different elements that make up pension policy, is the Pensions Board. I put the point again to the Minister, that the person in his or her late 20s or early 30s to whom I referred needs to know such information from an independent source. From reading the various legislative initiatives in this area, that source should be the Pensions Board. </P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy effectively is asking that the Pensions Board publish a league table of the performance of the PRSAs. It could not do that because it could potentially involve itself in protracted discussions, even litigation, with the PRSA providers in what, in effect, is an open market. PRSA providers may well have legitimate reasons for one provider's product being higher than another's. Putting an onus on the board to publish an annual league table every year would do a disservice to some PRSA providers who might be at the end of such a league table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" />The Deputies may say that all they are trying to do is to protect individuals, but they are protected on an individual basis by way of the statement of reasonable value which, under the legislation, must be given on a yearly basis and also by way of the statement of the current actual value of the investment. I relented on Committee Stage to exhortations from the far side of the House that such a statement must be delivered to a contributor every six months, but a contributor can ask for and must be given such a statement at any time, apart from the bi-annual requirement.</P>
    <P>I accept the issues raised by the Deputies are valid. They are being considered at policy level in the Pensions Board and, hopefully, with some experience in this area we might be able to bring something forward in the future. This is primarily PRSA legislation and bringing such a measure forward at this time in terms of the enactment of the PRSA vehicle is not considered the correct way to proceed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7) The Board shall prepare, amend from time to time as it considers appropriate and publish widely a Charter of Pension Consumers Rights to include all PRSA products.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment deals with the procedures governing the board's role in the granting of PRSA products. On foot of his discussions and the lengthy gestation of this Bill, the Minister has included a code of conduct in respect of producing, marketing and selling of PRSA products by providers. That will ensure a basic standard will be in place for the PRSA product. The Minister rejects the idea that the board could produce, even in a general way, a performance related table to show the performance of different products. I seek something less in this amendment, a widely published charter of pension consumers rights to include all PRSA products.</P>

      <P>We are discussing this legislation on the ultimate or penultimate day of this Dáil. It has taken a long time for it to reach this stage. I commend the staff in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister who has put a great deal of work into this area, particularly over the past year and a half. We were able to get the information on the PRSAs published separately, which we were able to distribute.</P>
      <P>Legislation in this area is complex. Having saved to buy a house, pension provision is probably the next most important area for which a family must provide. A clearly set out charter of rights for contributors and people who take out personal retirement savings accounts should be in place which, despite the complexity of this area and the legislation, would enable people to have at least a reasonable idea of what to expect in terms of such provision and how to proceed. I ask the Minister again to include a basic charter of rights such as this. We are familiar in local Government and in many areas of business life with having charters of basic rights for patients or consumers or directed at local authority services. In this area it is important that we have something similar. I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Board has a very important role generally, and especially in this legislation, in relation to awareness and the dissemination of information. Its remit includes the production of information booklets and after the passing of this Bill it will begin work on a booklet on PRSAs which will be distributed widely. It also undertakes many seminars and conferences about pensions. We are not convinced in the Department that a charter of consumer pension rights would be appropriate in relation to the code of conduct which is being introduced. This code of conduct will be drawn up by the Pensions Board for the PRSA providers and will set down the basic issues involved.</P>
      <P>I have added, since the legislation was introduced, provision for a consumer representative on the board. His or her role would be to look after the rights of consumers. Before the Bill was introduced there was provision for a consumer representative on the board but after Second Stage I introduced a similar amendment in order to provide for representation by a pensioner. We believe that the balance is correct and that a charter of rights is not required.</P>

      <P>I withdraw the amendment but if the Pensions Board examines our discussions today it might decide to follow through on the idea on its own initiative. Pensions are important and the area is a very detailed one. It is an opportunity that needs to be taken as early as possible in life, even in student days and when people are very young workers. People should have the opportunity to understand the various options. As we saw during the debate on this issue, the <Col N="653" /> vast majority of people have no idea about, for example, the difference between deferred benefit and deferred contribution. This is why many people make no provisions for themselves. They tend to shy away from what they see as the complexity of predicting the future. I urge the Pensions Board to pursue the idea of a charter. I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 arise from a discussion on Committee Stage and relate to the code entered into, before the licence is granted, between the PRSA provider and the board. The aim of the first amendment is to clarify that the board may consider the previous investment performance of the PRSA applicant before deciding upon its application. The second amendment provides for the board to consider the compliance record of the PRSA provider. These are two important issues. The Minister may tell me that before the granting of the approval of the PRSA product these two issues will be taken into consideration in terms of the code of conduct set out in section 94 but I have not read it in the Bill as clearly and as explicitly as it is set out in amendments Nos. 4 and 5.</P>
      <P>We do not want companies or individuals with poor records on investment performance or compliance with company law to become providers. It is important to state explicitly that these are two grounds on which the Pensions Board, as the regulator in this area, can refuse to grant a licence. The Minister may tell me that these criteria already exist but they are not as explicit as they are in my amendments. It would be useful if they were established in the legislation.</P>

      <P>The board will be overseeing the product and not regulating the provider. The provider will be authorised to provide services by the existing regulatory authority, such as the Central Bank or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is the responsibility of these authorities to supervise the entities they authorise when it comes to business conduct generally. In relation to product approval, a code of conduct will be drawn up by the Pensions Board for PRSA providers relating to the approval of the product. In this the product perspective addresses <Col N="654" /> the issues raised by the Deputy. When a provider is being approved previous performance must be taken into consideration and compliance must also be considered as the process continues. Two different bodies oversee the provider and the product. Their remits are explained well in the Bill and I do not think that the Deputy's proposal could improve matters any further.</P>

However, an efficient transfer of information between all sources is required to ensure these products are of the highest standard. It is necessary to state this explicitly in respect of the approval of products and the code of conduct. This would not be required if we ensured the information flow as set out in the legislation occurred, and I hope this will happen, but explicit references such as the ones in these amendments will be required.</P>

      <P>I am seeking to have the level of charges on contributions reduced to 3%. I know the Minister made a cogent argument on providing more flexibility. It is, however, fair to say that we have had a great deal of controversy down through the years about the types of charges levelled on insurance products. Many people feel the practice of front-loading charges, in particular, has often removed some of the value which the product would have reached if that had not occurred.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, by reference to different performances in the past, that it was felt a figure of 5% would be more encouraging to providers. Nonetheless, it appears to give a good deal of scope in that regard. It could be keener. Likewise, I argued on Committee Stage for a keener limit on charges in relation to 1% of assets. One needs to look at the history of the insurance industry and the fact that people have felt that the front-loading of charges on different products has been antithetical to the kind of results which contributors wanted to achieve when they invested in projects. I urge the Minister to reconsider these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>We looked quite closely at this issue when drafting the Bill. Most of the industry felt the charges incorporated in the legislation were too low. The view was expressed that providers would not bother going into the market because charges were so low. We had to strike a balance in this regard. I stress that the 1% and 5% levels are maximum levels. If, as time moves on, all the charges are bunched at the higher limit, we will have to look at that issue again.</P>
      <P>The maximum charge on the stakeholder pension in the UK is 1% of the assets only but the Deputy must take into account that there is a greater volume of pensions in that market and a number of companies have said they may not survive. I would err on the side of caution in terms of adjusting the charges. While all of us would like to see low charges, a balance must be struck. The charges provided for in the legislation are reasonably low to protect the consumer. I do not accept the amendment but the charges will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 26, to delete lines 18 and 19 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) An employer shall pay, at his own expense, contributions into the employee's PRSA which at least equal the employee's contributions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a key amendment in the area of PRSA accounts. The Minister referred to this issue at length on Second and Committee Stages. The issue of occupational pensions was examined in the famous NPPI report a few years ago and it was felt that there was a major problem in Ireland because the bulk of private sector workers did not have such pensions. The opportunity arose through PRSAs to remedy this and increase the numbers of people who would hold second tier pensions.</P>
      <P>I have urged the Minister to go one step further. An employee has the right to consider taking out such a pension but the employer should also make mandatory contributions. It should be a requirement in legislation that both employers and employees should contribute to a fund. That is a reasonable demand. Management contracts refer to pension emoluments and compensation and very often they comprise a significant portion of an employee's future income. We have an opportunity to require employers to give real support to PRSAs by asking them to contribute as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a provision would be underpinned by section 787J of the Principal Act because the contributions would be tax exempt. Employers would be able to provide significant future remuneration to their employees by making a mandatory contribution together with the employee to the PRSA. I urge the Minister, on behalf of workers, particularly those who are young and hope to <Col N="660" /> provide for their futures through occupational pensions, to give the PRSA a further kick start and accept the amendment. The legislation states employers &ldquo;may&rdquo; contribute to PRSAs but I want it to state that they &ldquo;shall&rdquo; contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the key issues in respect of pensions policy as we go forward. A consensus was reached in the 1998 report on pensions between employers and employees. Union representatives and business interests agreed that a mandatory regime would not be implemented when the PRSA product was introduced. On reflection, that was probably the wrong position to take. We can draw on the experience of the UK stakeholder pensions, which have been a gigantic flop, and this issue must be dealt with sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister responded to a proposal I made regarding a review mechanism. He has inserted a new section that will give him the power to review this issue if the PRSAs are not taken up, as anticipated. This issue can be addressed only in the context of the next partnership agreement and, until it is addressed, the level of cover that is expected will not be achieved. We must move to a position where employee contributions are looked upon in the same way as contributions by many large companies to their employees, otherwise employers will wriggle out of their responsibilities and obligations.</P>
      <P>The Minister needs to outline his thinking behind the review mechanism. He will be aware that the next set of figures to be published regarding pension cover will show that less than 50% of the workforce has pension cover. While it is welcome that more people are working in the economy, the number of pensions has reduced since the last survey of pension cover. This is a key issue but whether it will be broached in the context of this legislation is another matter. It can be addressed in the long-term only when employers make contributions commensurate to those made by employees.</P>

      <P>The principle underlying the legislation is to implement the recommendations of the national pension policy initiative which, as Deputy Hayes said, resulted from a consensus reached among the social partners in this area. The trade unions, on behalf of workers, did not insist on a mandatory regime. They agreed to the voluntary arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a radical proposal which would be foisted on employers without discussion or negotiation and would not be in keeping with the spirit of social partnership. If social partnership is to work, there must be an acceptance on all sides that if an agreement is made, it must be adhered to and that is the posi<Col N="661" /> tion. In the section concerning pensions, the PPF stated that a survey would be carried out into the coverage in the first 15 months of the programme to monitor progress towards the target. There is an acknowledgement in the PPF that the situation was to be reviewed. The proposal to which I agreed, as prompted by Deputy Hayes, in the amendment we made on Committee Stage to implement the review will take that into account. The experience of the mandatory approach in Australia is that schemes are designed to provide the bare minimum and that is not the way to proceed. There has been a downside to the mandatory approach in Australia. I have asked the Pensions Board to look at this and now that we have put the review mechanism into the legislation, if the voluntary approach does not work, we will come back to the drawing board. We must give the position agreed with the social partners a chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's logic in the context of the new product but it is an issue that should be discussed at the negotiations for the next national partnership agreement. The Minister for Finance tried to encourage people to save through the SSIAs. There were other macro economic aims, for instance, to cool the economy, but it was a strategic decision. The Labour Party regretted that he did not put in place a scheme as Combat Poverty wanted, dedicated to those on the lowest incomes, including social welfare recipients and pensioners.</P>
      <P>In the context of the future increases in salary, set aside for pensions as part of a reward for work done is a clear and important way to go. We can only do that if the employers are involved and they are granted a major tax concession by this Bill where it amends the revenue sections. The Labour Party will revisit this idea in future.</P>

That will provide the benchmark by which we can judge what happens in future. That will feed into the discussions that take place. I take the Deputy's points but we are honour bound to implement the agreement made under the national pension policy initiative, an agreement that was unanimous on going the voluntary route. Employers, employees and the interests represented on the board agreed we should go the voluntary route. We will try it, but if it does not work we will go back to the drawing board.</P>

The PRSA provider has other obligations under this amended section but, with reference to the first amendments I tabled, it is important in relation to investment and insurance products to have a continuing report on their performance.

I wanted to include existing occupational pensions in the provision. However, the kind of information I seek in that context is not widely available. The issue at stake is the basic point that we need the fullest possible information before we can choose a particular pension product. This applies, in particular, to people who have reached the most expensive point in their lives, for example, young couples with major commitments who are trying to purchase a house and establish a family. It is incumbent on us to ensure that such persons are given the fullest information.</P>
      <P>I have commended the Minister in the past for the increases in contributory and non-contributory pensions, which have been one of the most important aspects of his administration. I hope the incoming Government will be determined to develop and uphold the kinds of increases for our pensioners he has introduced. The Labour Party is committed to doing so in Government. It is important that a young person considering the purchase of his or her first PRSA product is aware of the likely increases in first tier pensions.

      <P>&ldquo;(8)(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;Contributions shall be treated in the same manner for the purpose of relief from income tax, where the payment of the contribution is made by the contributor or is made on his behalf to the PRSA provider.</P>

      <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;Such relief from pay-related social insurance and health levy as applies to PRSA contributions shall apply to contributions in respect of existing personal pensions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment in respect of the treatment of tax relief on various contributions. We had a brief discussion of this on Committee Stage and this amendment seeks to provide a level playing field in respect of the contributions made by employees. As the Minister knows, PRSI relief currently is not given to employees who choose their own pension. There is a distinction between contribution payments made directly by the contributor and contributions made by the employer through their salary deduction, so there is a fundamental tax distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the underlying commitment to the introduction of PRSAs to introduce a flexible model of pensions. He has committed himself to that and I welcome the major thrust of this legislation but we must ensure there are no distinctions in taxation policy in respect of the treatment of various pensions. It seems unfair that this distinction should still exist between those who make their own pension provisions and contributions in their own way and those who have their pension provisions paid for through their employers. As the Minister knows, that distinction exists because of the PRSI differential. He may tell us that he has no power in respect of the Minister for Finance and that he is simply stitching in all of these sections from the Department of Finance but he is the Minister bringing the legislation to the House. It is essential that we try to iron out some of the existing anomalies in <Col N="668" /> our taxation law regarding pensions and I ask him to consider this amendment. It attempts to create a level playing field for all concerned and would be in the interests of contributors, employees and those who want to make contributions in their own way as opposed to those who do so through their employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be no harm to read my note as it will clarify the position from all points of view.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to have contributions made on behalf of the employee treated in the same manner as contributions made by the employee for tax, PRSI or health levy purposes. It also seeks to have all pension products put on an equal footing regarding PRSI and health levy charges.</P>
      <P>I must reject the amendment on the basis that the existing provisions both in this Bill, as passed on Committee Stage, and the Social Welfare Bill, 2002, already achieve the same objective. Under the tax provisions, as in section 4 of this Bill, PRSA contributions by an employer are treated as a benefit in kind in the hands of the employee. Such contributions are treated for tax purposes as having been made by the employee so that effectively the benefit in kind charge will arise only where the aggregate contributions made in a year exceed the relevant limits. Relief from PRSI and health levies will also be given in respect of such contributions. The Social Welfare Bill, 2002, provides for a relief from PRSI and health levies in respect of RAC and PRSA contributions where the contributor is an employee or a director. In the case of PRSA contributions from an employer, the contributions are treated as having been made by the employee or director for that purpose also.</P>
      <P>The overall effect of these measures is that subject to limits, relief from PRSI and health levies will apply in respect of all pension contributions by an employee, whether to an occupational pension scheme, a PRSA or RAC. Accordingly, I must reject the amendment on the basis that these matters are already in the Bill as drafted and the Social Welfare Act, which has hopefully passed at this stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general issue of taxation, it is a fact that the Minister for Finance has the primary responsibility regarding tax provisions but the tax provisions in relation to PRSAs are very generous, as a result of the agreement of the Minister for Finance in this respect.</P>

As I said on Second Stage, it was one of the reasons for reservations among some trade unionists about the public sector area.

      <P>&ldquo;(ii) by the substitution in section 772(3A) and (3B) of &lsquo;employee' for &lsquo;proprietary director';&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to fund-based retirement options. Ordinary employees cannot avail of the option to select an improved retirement fund instead of a fixed pension on retirement, but this amendment would allow maximum flexibility to employees. A provision giving the fund-based retirement option to company directors was introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act, 1999, but my reading of the legislation indicates that such a measure is not in place for others. In this amendment, I propose to give the option open to company directors to all employees, so they can determine their requirements without being directed by the State, as is currently the case. This Bill provides that they will not be entitled to such an option.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the 15 year rule which is part of this Bill and on which we had a discussion on Committee Stage. My party does not think the rule will be to the ultimate benefit of employees and those who want to move out of the arrangements they are in at present. Given the general principles of maximum flexibility and personal choice on which the Bill is based, we should ensure that employees can do what they like with their money and their savings schemes. It is not the responsibility of the State to tell people they cannot use their money for certain purposes. Amendment No. 47 attempts to give a legislative form to such flexibility.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. It is fair to say the changes made by the Minister for Finance in 1999 to the approved retirement fund <Col N="671" /> gave extra freedom to employees. He said at the time that he was not opposed to the principle of annuities and I think I heard him repeat that recently. Those who have put money away for pension plans deserve the maximum flexibility at the end of their period of contribution and should be trusted to manage their own money. My amendment No. 48 is based on the same general idea as the amendment under discussion. I would like workers to be given the freedom to manage the fruits of their PRSAs and, therefore, I support Deputy Hayes' amendment.</P>

The Minister said there is &ldquo;no better man&rdquo; than Deputy McCreevy, but it is not just that the rights that apply to company directors cannot be transferred to everyone else. The Minister may tell the House that this is nothing to do with him as it is a matter for the Finance Act, but he is the sponsoring Minister who is bringing this Bill through the House. This section of the Bill deals with PRSAs and we have an obligation to highlight some of the inconsistencies in pensions policy by proposing amendments on Committee and Report Stages. It is unfair to restrict the options for ordinary employees, given that liberating amendments were brought in during the debate on the Finance Bill, 1999, offering unbelievable pension options to the self-employed and company directors. It is a mistake not to offer these choices to ordinary employees.</P>

I propose that the committee vet the various candidates seeking the position of ombudsman. On Committee Stage, the Minister did not accept these amendments. However, in parliamentary terms, we are moving to a situation where many of these high profile appointments should be made by committees. There should be some vetting by the committee system of all those appointed. It would also involve the House in a more direct way with the legislation. Given that the House is setting up this new office of ombudsman, it has a responsibility to monitor the work of the ombudsman. The direct control of the Minister and the Minister for Finance on all the ombudsmen who have been appointed is too <Col N="674" /> much. The committee could have a role in this matter.</P>

The Deputy referred to the examination of the ombudsman's work by an Oireachtas committee, and that is provided for. It is possible that the ombudsman could be summoned to the Oireachtas committee. I do not see these amendments as necessary. In effect the Deputy is trying to give the say-so as to appointments to an Oireachtas committee but that would not be acceptable.</P>

I made the point on Second Stage that the ageing directive is expected from the European Union in 2006. Under that directive it will be illegal to have specific ages for certain jobs. We have to get away from ageism. Recently the chief executive of the Equality Authority did some good work on cases brought before him of workers who applied for certain positions or sought to enter certain premises and so on. Where any ageist criteria was used he was able to show it was illegal. This is an area about which we have to be careful. Obviously there cannot be discrimination against older people.</P>

These criteria would also be areas to which the ombudsman might refer. At the start of the debate today there was a series of amendments in which I sought to include reference to the best possible indicators of market performance. I ask that the ombudsman would have that type of accountability. Clearly, the Minister disagrees.</P>

      <P>In page 68, line 9, to delete &ldquo;Ombudsman&mdash;&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ombudsman. It shall be a matter for the Pensions Ombudsman to determine what complaints or references under this section shall be investigated and a determination made thereupon.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a long discussion on Committee Stage on this issue. Deputy Broughan and I are agreed that we want the pensions ombudsman to investigate any complaints which come before him or her, without time limits.</P>
      <P>The Office of the pensions ombudsman is the first real legislative vehicle by which ordinary pensioners can put complaints where they feel they have a grievance. In objecting to this amendment, the Minister argued that he does not want to have the office flooded with complaints. I do not think that will happen. Amendment No. 55 and others give sufficient discretion to allow the ombudsman to determine what he wants to investigate. The Minister made some effort in the Seanad to move from three years to six years the length of time in which an investigation must take place. He has also tabled an amendment regarding the time when an act first came to the attention of a complainant. I believe this is confusing. A time limit is not needed and the ombudsman must be allowed the maximum flexibility. We do not wish to tie his hands in any way and we want him to use his discretion in investigations.</P>
      <P>The pensions ombudsman will be required to determine questions on the basis of fact. He will have to present a case and others will have to ensure they follow his recommendations to the letter. Many pensioners have questions to ask regarding pension schemes and many schemes must come under the ombudsman's microscope. It would be a disgrace to allow the Bill to pass while excluding some people from the kind of high profile investigation promised under this legislation.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage I implore the Minister to take the view of the Opposition in respect of this issue. He has gone some of the way. We are now asking him to go the last mile to ensure the best possible regime to investigate these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am dissatisfied that the Minister for Finance is given such a strong hand in this legislation. The ombudsman cannot appoint an additional member of staff to his office or seek additional revenues without the approval of the Minister for <Col N="677" /> Finance. This is not the way ombudsman legislation has been put in place by other Legislatures. We must remove the centralising focus of the Department of Finance from this legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this important set of amendments, even at this late stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is indeed the most significant series of amendments to the Bill and this is the last opportunity this Oireachtas will have to regulate pensions. All Deputies on all sides of the House have large files of references from employees who feel their pension schemes have been managed badly. Surpluses have not been distributed properly and schemes have been seriously underfunded by management. I mentioned some celebrated cases during the debate on Second Stage. I represented workers in the Irish Press Group, for example, who felt there was serious underfunding of the No. 2 fund, under which their pensions were being taken care of. I have received representations from a wide range of companies, such as the Ford Motor Company and the Guinness Group, in relation to the management of surpluses. On Second Stage I also mentioned the Tara Mines retired workers and the concerns of workers with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the three year and six year limits will be flexible and that the ombudsman might be able to take a long look-back as a result. Nevertheless, the legal basis must be clear and I strongly commend the amendments in the names of Deputy Hayes and myself, which seek to give the ombudsman the widest possible reference of a look-back into the past. The Minister said the average time for employees to enjoy a pension is nine years. On that basis a look-back of ten years would be fairer.</P>
      <P>This issue is fundamental. All 86,000 occupational pensions will not come to the ombudsman's desk but we are all aware of a significant number about which complaints have been made in the past and on which the ombudsman's hands should not be tied.</P>
      <P>It is important that the ramifications of this Bill ensure that a person such as Robert Maxwell, who allegedly placed some of his workers' pension funds in accounts and businesses which had nothing to do with their welfare, should not emerge in the future. We can do this by giving the ombudsman a free hand in this regard.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>: </b>I spoke on this issue during the debate on Second Stage and I support the amendments. It is strange that we appoint an ombudsman to deal with complaints while stipulating that only a certain number of complaints can be dealt with. Many pension funds have been set up longer than six years and these regulations could be very unfair to members of these funds, many of whom are advanced in years. Why are we making a distinction between two groups of people who have been wronged, <Col N="678" /> one group being lucky enough to have been wronged within the six year limit and the other not?</P>
      <P>I cannot see how the ombudsman's office will be flooded with complaints because he will, invariably, be dealing with principles which will affect a number of workers. I became aware of the difficulties which can beset pension funds when the sugar company workers in Carlow found that while there was a considerable amount of money in their pension fund their State retirement pensions were docked. The ombudsman should be asked to give his views on the matter. If a wrong has been done to pensioners it should be rectified. Why should a huge pension fund not be used to pay pensioners, the people who built up the fund originally? Many sugar company pensioners, some of whom are quite old, feel they have been wronged and deprived of money to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to let everyone have a fair crack of the whip. If the ombudsman is there to hear complaints, let him hear genuine complaints and, as Deputy Broughan said, weed out those that are frivolous and indefensible. We must avoid a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation, where some pensioners can make complaints to the ombudsman and some can not.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will recall how often over a number of years on the Order of Business I asked the Taoiseach and the Minister concerned about the CIE pensioners. I am speaking on amendments Nos. 55 to 60 regarding the time limit on the ombudsman's remit. CIE pensioners, for example, would be affected by this provision. Before CIE broke up into Iarnród Éireann and so on, it had approximately 15 pension schemes. The fund of non-salaried staff &ndash; put simply, all those in uniform &ndash; was in huge surplus. It was represented to some that they should take a small lump sum and some are now on £40 per week after 40 years service. The surplus from their fund was put into the amalgamated fund. They could not understand why the governing rules &ndash; exactly as Deputy Browne said &ndash; stopped them having access to the surplus even though a huge number of them were approaching pension age. This can be considered and the argument that it would open the floodgates does not apply. A case taken by a non-salaried member of CIE would solve the issue of all those who were in uniform and who are locked into a consequence of the amalgamation of their schemes in a particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People working for agencies and who have an agency relationship with the State point to anomalies, let us say, between non-established and established civil servants. I am thinking of those who work in health and safety, for example. If an anomaly is identified, it is the anomaly that would be for adjudication by the ombudsperson. In a reply to a written question today on the midland pensioners to whom I referred, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said if com<Col N="679" /> panies are no longer semi-State and are independent, she has no function in relation to their pensions. The difference is that these people had pension schemes for which the State had a responsibility. When the State shed its responsibility for many of the companies and, effectively, put them into a commercial relationship, these pensioners lost very significant rights.</P>
    <P>There are two other powerful reasons not to limit the remit of the ombudsman. We had this argument in relation to people who had been abused and child abuse when I was education spokesperson. We argued that this restriction should be removed because of the time it took people to discover that they had been wronged. In one case, a person who had an alcohol problem signed up to an arrangement for his early retirement. Many years later his widow, who was entitled to half of what he had settled for, had to go back and make a case to a particular body and try to suggest that her husband was not in a position to know all the facts when, effectively, he signed something that not only signed away his rights in a diminished sense but signed away his wife's rights which she did not discover until some years later. I could think of many more such cases.</P>
    <P>If the right of access to the pensions ombudsperson is a right rather than a commercial relationship, the time limit should not apply. We are not talking about the law of contract but about people's right to income. It could have been expressed that normally six years would apply but that in exceptional circumstances, the ombudsperson could take on these cases which would not be normal. By restricting it to a specified number of years, as amended in the Seanad, there is, effectively, an exclusion order on all those who are still suffering. If this is to be welcome legislation on pensions, the appropriate emphasis should be one based on rights rather than on a limitation in time. I support the amendments in the Deputy's name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputies that the functions of the pensions ombudsman primarily are in relation to issues of maladministration and disputes about fact or law on pensions. We had a long discussion on this. In the Bill as originally drafted there was a three year set limit. As a result of representations and the discussion we had in the Seanad, I agreed to consider the matter again and I went further than the three years, to six years. The Deputies acknowledged that. As I said earlier, given the way in which the legislation is drafted, it is not an absolute six years and I again stress this. We checked this with the Attorney General's office and the advice is that there is discretion. The ombudsman will have discretion in relation to the definition of when an act takes place. It states six years from the date of the act giving rise to the complaint. There is scope for the ombudsman to determine when that act kicks in which gives rise to the time limit. <Col N="680" /> There is flexibility of interpretation in the way it is drafted to allow the pensions ombudsman to determine when the clock starts to tick. That is something similar to changes made to the Civil Liability Act.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for Deputies to say the floodgates would not open. The reality is, if my memory serves me correctly, there are 85,000 existing schemes covering 650,000 people. The idea is to put in place a pensions ombudsman for the PRSA regime and the occupational pensions. The strong advice is that we have to strike a balance. Even if a tiny proportion of the people in those 85,000 schemes came forward with a complaint, there would be a deluge of work which the ombudsman's office would not be able to address while at the same time dealing with schemes which are beginning or which have been in place for the past six years. We have to draw the line somewhere.</P>
      <P>While it may be easy for Deputies to say we should extend it <i>ad infinitum</i>, the reality is that we have to have time limits. There are time limits in all legislation to provide some reality. If one was to leave it open-ended, schemes which date back decades could arise. A lot of the principal people involved in those schemes would not perhaps be alive today. Some of the Deputies and people outside may believe the six years is sacrosanct but it is not because there is flexibility in the interpretation of the act. The legislation states &ldquo;six years from the date of the act giving rise to the complaint&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If it was open-ended, I believe, and it is the strong advice of my Department, there would be a deluge of complaints retrospectively and that, in effect, the ombudsman might constantly end up in the High Court dealing with challenges to schemes on which the views of people would have long been ventilated. People would have had the opportunity over the years to challenge in court the documents on the framing of the pension schemes but would have chosen not to do so.</P>
      <P>I have gone a long way and have increased the period from three to six years. That is the standard time limit for civil and most other legal actions that can be taken in this State. There is flexibility and I suggest that it be left to the pensions ombudsman to determine when time started ticking. If legislation was to be more prescriptive than that, we would be doing the opposite to what we wish to do. It would withdraw some of the pensions ombudsman's flexibility. I ask Deputies to be realistic. They should listen to the advice, based on the experience and advice of my officials, I have outlined to both Houses which is reasonable in the circumstances. The issue of flexibility, as advised by the Attorney General, is built in and we believe this is the best way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument. He referred to 85,000 schemes which could potentially come before the ombudsman's office. The reality is that only a small number of <Col N="681" /> them are in dispute. If one of those cases were to come before the ombudsman and were to refer to the issues of surpluses or anything else, it would set a precedent for other cases. Pensioners would then find out if they were right or wrong. One case study could take away the grievance of others. That is the benefit of ensuring that we create the maximum opportunity for the ombudsman to look back. Many of the schemes which are in dispute relate to Irish companies. Some of them are large companies which are still trading and making large amounts of money. They have not given sufficient protection to their pensioners and that is shameful.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes the point about the floodgates opening. My amendment would give absolute discretion to the ombudsman. It reads:</P>
      <P>It shall be a matter for the Pensions Ombudsman to determine what complaints or references under this section shall be investigated and a determination made thereupon.</P>
      <P>It is not our job to give our view of discretion in the Bill. It is our job to give absolute discretion to the ombudsman so that his hands are not tied in investigating these matters. The acceptance of my amendment No. 55 and Deputy Broughan's amendment would give that discretion solely to the ombudsman. It is for us to give the ombudsman the power to give maximum effect to his office. If the ombudsman needs another ten staff to sort out this problem, then so be it. Nobody is suggesting that these historical problems will emerge in the future, but they may.</P>
      <P>The fingerprints of the Department of Finance are all over this legislation. There is a view within that Department that the ombudsman will be given the least rather than that maximum number of offices. Let us not tie the hands of the ombudsman. I ask the Minister to rethink his position even at this late stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister opposed the type of performance criteria I attempted to introduce for new products and PRSAs. In this case we are discussing difficulties that have arisen over the years in occupational pension schemes because of the restrictions of existing rules, maladministration or serious underfunding. The pensioners to whom Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred certainly have grievances. They have been waiting for the day when this Act becomes law and the Minister sets out the regulations governing the establishment of the office of the ombudsman. In the past, one could only make a case to the Pensions Board. Investigations often occurred but little or nothing transpired because the necessary resources were not in place. The Pensions Board did not have much power. The Minister has the chance to give absolute discretion to the ombudsman regarding problems with occupational pension schemes in the past. I urge him to support the amendments which allow for that discretion.</P>

        <b>: </b>But it is still six years. There could be many pension schemes going back six years that might have minor defects and some maladministration. There could be a major scheme that goes back eight years with such problems. It would be shocking if we were to introduce legislation which would prevent a major case just two years outside the limit being dealt with by the ombudsman. How could that be regarded as equitable?</P>
      <P>We heard a lot about floodgates in the recent referendum and it was a figment of people's imagination. We should not be thinking about floodgates opening. Surely not all pension schemes are wrong. I cannot accept the suggestion that floodgates will open. Even with that risk, which I do not accept exists, it is more important that we make sure that those with serious complaints about how their pension fund was administered can get satisfaction.</P>

Deputy Hayes is naive if he thinks legislation can pass through the Oireachtas without the imprimatur of the Department of Finance. It cannot. He was also wrong when he said one case could be a test case. That cannot happen. Trustees might not accept the ombudsman's determination in one case affecting all&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point arises in relation to my question about the CIE pensioners. They were in a relationship to the State under CIE. The company was then changed and the nature of the 12 or 15 pension funds changed also. The Minister responsible for transport has no function in relation to those pensioners. The Taoiseach gave an indication to me that he would consider the case sympathetically and asked the Minister for Public Enterprise to write to me, but she says I can do nothing now. Is the Minister's suggestion that she has no function in the matter, an act definable within the terms of the Act and so would allow the ombudsman to look at their case?</P>

      <P>It does not depend on my statement in the Dáil. It depends on the interpretation of the legislation and that is up to the courts. If the pensions ombudsman decides that he can take up a case, then he would have to prove that he is entitled to do so under the legislation. Other people could challenge his interpretation. What I say here does not determine what he is entitled to do. It is entirely up to the ombudsman to decide if he has discretion, although there is flexibility in the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went some way towards accepting the general thrust of the discussion we had on membership of the board. We were anxious on Second and Committee Stages to ensure that a member of a pensioners' representative body and consumer interests would be represented on the board. I was convinced by the arguments put in relation to the insurance broking industry. The reference to &ldquo;insurance banking industry&rdquo; in the amendment is incorrect and should read &ldquo;insurance broking industry&rdquo;.

      <P>When I came to deal with this Bill, we included a consumer representative. As the Bill proceeded through both Houses of the Oireachtas, I came of the view that a pensions board specifically should have a representative of pensioners on it. I have an open mind about a representative from a national organisation. That is probably the intention, but I do not want to be prescriptive in that respect.  With regard to having a representative from the insurance banking industry on the board, we had this argument on Committee Stage. Its interests are well represented. If different people were to be nominated to the board, I would be fearful that they would have more in mind the interests of the organisations they represent rather than the broad view in relation to pensions. I am not saying that about insurance brokers, but much of what they said related to their remit. In any event, the Insurance Federation is represented on the board and, to a certain extent, it would look after the interests of insurance brokers.</P>

I want to place on record my thanks to Opposition Members, both here and in the Seanad. They could have interfered with the progress of this Bill, given that time was of the essence in the run up to the general election, but they chose not to and I thank them for that, as do the officials in my Department.</P>
      <P>This is agreed legislation but I know people were put to the test in relation to its examination, both here and in the Seanad. In fact it was probably more difficult in the Seanad than in the Dáil. I thank my officials, who were absolutely excellent over the few years that this legislation has been in gestation. I thank all the people who made representations and also the staff of both Houses, who had difficulties introducing all the amendments at every Stage in both Houses.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">1. acknowledges the Government's achievement in relation to health care and in particular:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;commends the Government for its unparalleled increases in health funding;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;commends the Government's new Health Strategy which is firmly grounded in the principles of equity, accountability, fairness and people-centredness;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;commends the Government for extending eligibility for medical cards to all people over 70 years of age;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;welcomes the Government's commitment in the Strategy to extending medical card coverage to cover more people on low income including targeted increases to ensure more children, in particular, are covered;</P>

    <P Just="Center">&ndash;continues to endorse investment in initiatives such as the Waiting List Initiative and the Treatment Purchase Fund;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;commends the Government's commitment to the provision of an additional 3,000 Acute Hospital beds over the next ten years and to fund the commissioning of 709 beds in 2002 as a first step in increasing bed capacity in the acute hospital sector,</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="692" />2. notes with approval the unprecedented increase of 85% in funding for education to &euro;5.4 billion during the Government's term and the huge advances made in providing high quality, accessible and inclusive education, including:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;greatly improved pupil teacher ratios in schools;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the targeting of substantial extra resources and support services for disadvantaged children and children with learning difficulties, including specific measures to improve literacy levels;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;major progress in upgrading, modernising and providing new school accommodation as a result of a fourfold increase in capital funding for this purpose; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;looks forward to the continuation of these positive developments over the coming years,</P>
    <P Just="Center">3. welcomes the significant achievements by the Government in the housing area since 1997 and notes:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the comprehensive range of measures introduced to increase the supply of housing which have given rise to successive levels of record housing output in each of the last five years, culminating in the completion of 52,000 housing units in 2001, and the overall provision of 216,000 housing units in the Government's term;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the significant moderation in house price increases from a peak of 40% in 1998 to about 5-6% in the 12 months to end-September 2001;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;that first-time buyers have been afforded greater participation in the housing market; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the record level of funding of &euro;1.7 billion for housing in 2002 which is 3 times the amount provided in 1997,</P>
    <P Just="Center">4. welcomes the fact that good progress is being maintained with the development of the roads network as mandated in the National Development Plan and, in particular, notes that:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the total 2002 Exchequer provision for the national roads improvement programme is &euro;958 million, which represents an increase of &euro;50 million on the 2001 out-turn, is more than three times the 1997 level of expenditure;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the Exchequer investment of nearly &euro;2.5 billion which will have been made in national road improvements for the first 3 years of the NDP (to end 2002), is already more than &euro;260 million or some 10% in excess of the planned NDP profile;</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="693" />&ndash;the NRA programme will see over 20 major projects being taken forward during 2002;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;record funding of over &euro;438 million is being provided to maintain and improve the non-national road network,</P>
    <P Just="Center">5. welcomes the achievements of the Government in tackling traffic congestion in Dublin and other urban centres and, in particular:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;welcomes the progressive implementation of the NDP which provides for the investment of &euro;12 billion in transport over the 2002-06 period and the demonstrable progress made in 2000 and 2001 in implementing this investment programme;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;welcomes the significant increase in capital investment in public transport during the lifetime of the Government, including the provision of over &euro;400 million in Exchequer capital funding for public transport in 2002;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;welcomes the progress being made with regard to the Dart network, Luas and the Metro and the significant increase in bus numbers both in Dublin and provincial areas;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes that the DTI Strategy update &ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo; provides a comprehensive, updated framework for meeting Dublin's transport needs;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes the progress being made in the upgrading of the national road network in the Greater Dublin area where work has commenced on the Dublin Port Tunnel, the South-Eastern Motorway, the Cloghran/Balbriggan Motorway, Kildare bypass and Glen of the Downs project and in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford where major projects have either been completed in recent years, are under way or are well advanced in planning, and</P>
    <P Just="Center">6. congratulates the Government on five years of unprecedented economic and employment growth and the many successful steps taken during that period to tackle the underlying problems affecting the quality of people's lives.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support the motion tabled by Fine Gael dealing with public services. It is a highly appropriate motion for what is probably the last Private Members' business of this Dáil. The one area for which any Government has direct responsibility is public services. This Government seems very anxious to claim credit for things it did not do while neglect<Col N="694" /> ing the very services for which it has direct responsibility. As we debate this motion the election posters are appearing with the slogan &ldquo;Peace, prosperity, progress&rdquo;. The Government is attempting to claim credit for the peace for which many people on all sides of the House, outside the House and in other jurisdictions, have been working so hard. It attempts to claim the credit for our prosperity, the basis for which was laid by the last Government. It handed to this Administration a set of books in the black but as this Administration leaves office they are back in the red. The only progress this Government can report is that public services have become progressively worse under their administration.</P>
      <P>This Government has made a virtue of cutting tax but its undeclared policy has been, at best, to preside neutrally over a languishing public service and at worst, to see public services go into a serious decline. There is no doubt that public services are in worse shape now at the end of the five years of the current Administration than they were when it took charge. The effects can be seen everywhere: in our hospitals, with patients being treated in corridors or on trolleys or not being treated at all; in hostels bulging with the families of homeless people; and in the dilapidation of our towns and cities as local Government services and funding fail to keep up with the demands for adequate services. The serious condition of our public services is to be seen every evening and morning in our gridlocked towns, cities and transport arteries.</P>
      <P>This Government has brought the city of Dublin to a standstill. It failed to advance the Luas project or to invest in public transport. It presided over the provision of bus corridors by the Dublin Transportation Office and local authorities which ended up empty of buses. Even an administrative measure, the integration of ticketing between the different modes of transport, has not become a reality under this Government. The decline in our public services is to be seen in the inadequacy of our housing services. This is the Government that has made home ownership a luxury. When it came into office, the average price of a new house was &euro;87,000. Today it is &euro;187,000, as young working couples whose energy and work have contributed to the economic success story of this country are priced out of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has failed to provide adequate infrastructure. This can be seen in our roads. We have heard the criticisms of the Government's performance on the national development plan, particularly the criticisms of the Construction Industry Federation which has rightly pointed out that this Government is effectively holding up the road construction programme. The same can be said of the absence of waste infrastructure. In every county in there is a serious waste management and disposal problem. Landfill facilities are reaching the end of their lives and no alternative infrastructure has been put in place as the Government stumbles from <Col N="695" /> one paper plan to another without any real investment.</P>
    <P>It is no exaggeration that as investment in our public services has reached such a sorry point under this Government's administration, so too has the morale of many of our public servants. Morale among staff at the end of this Government's period of office is at an all-time low and the kind of industrial disputes emerging now in hospitals and schools have little to do with pay and material conditions &ndash; these are factors which must be negotiated &ndash; but have at their core a sense of demoralisation and demotivation. This is coming from the public servants whose job it is to deliver these services. They have seen the degree to which this Government has turned its back not only on the public service in general but also on the concept and value of public service. This is the decline which has been allowed to happen. The sooner this Government is rooted from office, the better for public services, for those who work in the public service and for the general public which consumes public services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Haughey, McGuinness, Keaveney and Kitt.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate as it provides an opportunity to put on the record of this House the major achievements of this Government in the areas of health, education, housing, roads and other public services. The sound and sensible economic and social policies of this Government and the wide-ranging investment programmes we have undertaken have facilitated huge improvements in our public services. We can be particularly proud of our achievements in the area of education. Education is a key public service which plays a crucial role in building a prosperous economy and an inclusive society. As a country, we have always placed a high value on a quality education. The investment we made in the education of our people, both young and not so young, has contributed greatly to meeting the skills needs of a dynamic new economy, to providing high quality sustainable employment and, crucially, to placing Ireland at the forefront of the global information society. Our educational policies are playing an increasingly important role in combating disadvantage, reducing inequities and enhancing the quality of life for all of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has placed education at the top of its agenda as a policy priority. In each of the years since coming into office, the Government has progressively increased funding for education with the result that total funding for education, at &euro;5.4 billion for 2002 is now 85% higher than was the case when the rainbow government left office. The increase in funding provided by the Government has enabled major improvements in services across all levels of provision. Since taking up office we have dramatically improved the number of teachers at primary and <Col N="696" /> post primary levels. To date, we have appointed more than 3,000 extra teachers and this will shortly rise to more than 4,000. To facilitate the supply of qualified teachers going forward, we have also substantially increased the number of teacher training places. The creation of additional teaching posts together with a decline in enrolments has resulted in a significant reduction in the overall pupil-teacher ratio in our schools in recent years and this will continue to fall over the coming years. At primary level, the average pupil-teacher ratio is now less than 20 to 1. At post primary level, the average pupil teacher ratio, taking account of part time posts, now stands at about 15 to 1.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some schools are experiencing difficulties in obtaining fully qualified teachers to fill vacancies for substitute and temporary posts and my Department is taking every possible measure to deal with any shortages which have arisen. Our record has been impressive in the area of school funding with schools now benefiting from unprecedented levels of funding support. At primary level, we have progressively increased capitation grants by some 80% in the period since 1997 to &euro;102 per pupil for the school year 2001-2002. On top of this, grant assistance for secretarial and caretaker services at primary level is being doubled during the current school year from &euro;51 to &euro;102 per pupil. There has also been an increase in the <i>per capita</i> grant at post-primary level. There will also be a corresponding increase in the annual minimum grant for smaller schools from &euro;5,079 to &euro;19,808. This funding will provide further substantial support to the school development planning process. Schools will have discretion in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils.</P>
    <P>We all know literacy represents an absolutely essential requirement for personal independence and effective participation in a modern society. While it is recognised that some children will experience learning problems of one kind or another during their school years, to suggest that 64,000 children at school have serious literacy difficulties is unnecessarily alarming and downright misleading. It is a sensationalist ploy by the Opposition which does a great disservice to the quality of our schools and the professionalism of our teachers. Literacy standards in our schools are generally higher than elsewhere. The Programme for International Assessment, PISA, recently studied reading, scientific and mathematical literacy levels amongst 15 year olds in 28 OECD countries. Its findings clearly demonstrate that the results achieved in Irish schools are excellent. It found that the literacy levels achieved by Irish 15 year olds were the fifth highest of the OECD countries worldwide and second highest in Europe. Only one country, Finland, achieved a significantly higher score. In the study of scientific literacy, Ireland ranked ninth overall with a score significantly higher than the OECD average and in the study of mathematical literacy, <Col N="697" /> Ireland ranked fifteenth overall which means that the performance of Irish students did not differ significantly from the OECD average.</P>
    <P>This Government has not been complacent. We fully recognise that a significant number of children require extra support to overcome learning difficulties or impediments which can arise from a variety of factors. In the area of literacy and numeracy, we have taken a number of very significant steps to support children with learning difficulties. Following a survey of remedial education in 1998, revised guidelines were provided for schools to ensure that the remedial service would be targeted at the children with greatest needs. Further to this, an extensive programme of training for teachers was initiated to facilitate the implementation of these guidelines. From September 1999, a learning support teacher service was extended to every first and second level school in the country. Since 1998 the number of learning support teachers has increased from 1,302 to 1,485. Learning support guidelines were introduced to provide practical guidance for teachers and parents on the provision of effective learning support to pupils with learning difficulties and low achievement in the areas of literacy and mathematics. These guidelines have been issued to schools and a programme of in-service training began last year. In addition, the number of special resource teachers catering for children with special needs in mainstream schools has increased from 124 to approximately 1,600 whole-time equivalents. There are also four special schools and 20 special classes in mainstream schools catering for the special needs of pupils with specific learning disability. These measures will ensure that children who might otherwise be considered at risk will develop sufficient literacy skills to enable them to derive maximum benefit from their education.</P>
    <P>Last December, my Department introduced an innovative new junior certificate school programme literacy strategy which promotes a school-wide approach to literacy development at junior cycle. Central to the strategy is the concept that all teachers are teachers of literacy. Within the strategy, schools are encouraged to put in place a literacy development plan which encompasses short-term interventions with targeted students and the fostering of a reading culture throughout the school. The strategy will also encourage schools to involve all subject teachers in adopting specific techniques in teaching the literacy demands of their subject area. It allows for subject specific learning to take place more effectively while at the same time improving literacy levels.</P>
    <P>We all know that education and literacy play key roles in the promotion of a more inclusive society and tackling educational disadvantage has been a major priority of this Government's education policy. Under the national development plan, more than &euro;500 million is being pro<Col N="698" /> vided to fund a range of programmes aimed at ensuring that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are given every opportunity to reach their full potential. These programmes include a range of measures to improve literacy and numeracy attainment in and out of school. The new National Anti-Poverty Strategy recently adopted by the Government also has an important role to play here. A crucial target of the new strategy is to reduce by 50% the number of children with serious literacy difficulties.</P>
    <P>We have developed new and innovative measures to address literacy and learning support. I assure the House that my Department will continue to give priority to this important area. We have also taken a number of initiatives in the ICT area about which time does not permit me to elaborate. A major programme is under way to upgrade primary and post-primary school buildings with &euro;1 billion allocated under the NDP for this purpose. As a result of past under investment, over the course of decades, the reality is that some schools are in a poor state of repair and require substantial funding for upgrading to meet modern requirements.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, in the lifetime of one Government, to wipe out the cumulative deficit of generations and to deal with emerging needs at the same time. However, it is only in the lifetime of this Government that there has been an increase in the level of investment which is capable of making a real difference. The facts clearly demonstrate our sustained commitment to rectifying the deficit and to providing for new building needs. In addition, the Government has introduced a grant scheme for minor works at primary level. In the region of 1,000 grant approvals costing in the region of &euro;33 million were given to primary schools in 2001 in respect of minor projects and purchases of furniture. In addition, an annual capital grant of &euro;3,809 per school plus &euro;12.70 per pupil is paid to all primary schools at a total cost in excess of &euro;17.7 million.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has given a categorical assurance about our clear commitment to continuing with the work we have started and to building on the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools right across the country are met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very negative motion from a very negative party. I welcome the report from the Central Bank announcing that the global economic downturn is over. That is good news. Everybody can now feel positive about the future economic development of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that since 1997 Ireland has experienced substantial economic growth which has literally transformed our society. Ireland has changed significantly over the past five years and I am not sure whether all Members realise that. There has been a deterioration in our <Col N="699" /> quality of life as a result of the substantial economic growth but that is being tackled. We are faced with new challenges in the areas of health, public transport, child care and housing and new approaches and policies are needed. I am confident the Government, and Fianna Fáil in particular, will produce the necessary responses to tackle the issues which have resulted from the changes that have taken place.</P>
    <P>I refer to the health services in my constituency, for example. We continue to receive complaints regarding our health services but the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, is being implemented. I welcome the provision of 37 new beds under the strategy in Beaumont Hospital this year and the commitment to provide another 70 beds at the hospital next year. I also welcome the development control plan which has been launched for the Mater and Temple Street Hospitals. This will create a new hospital campus on the derelict car park site at the Mater Hospital. These measures, among others, are being taken to facilitate a greatly improved service in the accident and emergency departments of hospitals on the north side and will go a long way to reduce hospital waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Economic growth, a significant population boom and increased car ownership have highlighted the inadequacies of our public transport system in recent years. However, the Minister for Public Enterprise has initiated a major programme of investment in this area. For example, Dublin Bus has purchased 431 new buses and there has been progress on DART services, Luas, the metro and institutional arrangements to address public transport issues. A major programme of reform and investment is evident on the ground and next year there will be improved services for all to see.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, I welcome the 20% social and affordable housing provision under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and the introduction of the affordable housing scheme. These measures will go a long way to providing much needed housing for young people in particular. The north fringe action plan has been adopted by Dublin City Council in my constituency and will be a significant programme in terms of ensuring there is adequate social and affordable housing for young people. That will be one of the best legacies of the Government. The measures introduced to address the housing problems are welcome and will be most effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>The job of the Opposition is to challenge the Government on its policies and the direction it takes in regard to the management of the economy but, in doing so, it cannot abandon reality. Reality has been abandoned during a number of Private Members' debates recently. We must reflect on the health of the economy in the early 1990s and the changes that have taken place since in the context of this debate. There has been a substantial change in <Col N="700" /> how we conduct business. There is a significant difference in the number of people who are in employment and there has been a revolution in the area of information communications technology. That revolution has been based on the sound economic policies that have been put in place by the Government since 1997.</P>
      <P>The economy is expanding rapidly and Ireland is the envy of its European neighbours. They have tried to ascertain how we have developed the economy so rapidly while some of the greatest nations in Europe have been in recession. Ireland has a great deal going for it. Listening to the contributions of Opposition Members, one would think Ireland was going down the tubes with words like &ldquo;abysmal&rdquo; and &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; used to describe public services. Disasters are six a penny in light of the impending election.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to remind ourselves that the economy is expanding and road and rail services and housing are needed. The Government has a policy in each area and it is positively developing those policies. For example, we will put a health strategy before the electorate for its consideration and approval. A great deal has been done. There are new challenges and the next Dáil will be presented with further challenges and radical policies will be needed to address them.</P>
      <P>One must acknowledge what needs to be done in terms of road and rail transport. We need an integrated transport policy. We must examine not only the transport of people but also the transport of goods. There must be a debate on how to deliver those services and it will be part and parcel of the next Dáil. We have a fine public service which is responding to the many needs of the economy but the significant changes in recent years must be acknowledged. I take issue with this Dáil placing in the hands of the NRA the role of developing our road infrastructure without a proper debate or ensuring it is accountable to the House. In that context, the Dáil also needs to be reformed.</P>
      <P>I would like a home for the elderly to be built in my constituency, the completion of the Piltown ring road and the commencement of a commuter service between Carlow-Kilkenny and Dublin. However, all these developments are in the planning stages and have been progressed significantly since 1997. I look forward to seeing them delivered upon in the next Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredible to listen to the promises about what will happen in regard to these lists and to the condemnation of what has <Col N="701" /> been done over the past five years. Deputies Noonan and Quinn reduced the funding for waiting lists to £10 million whereas this year the allocation is &euro;113 million. The health budget has been increased by 125% and 709 beds are coming on stream, which is more than the Government's target of 650. This has even had an impact in my own constituency. I do not know what will happen if Labour and Fine Gael are returned to power because Declan Bree stated in a recent debate on Mid-West Radio that he would abandon the health strategy and distribute medical cards. That is an example of cheap electioneering auction politics, which do not work. It is better to deal with these matters with a long-term strategy such as that offered by the health strategy. I commend the Minister for Health and Children for the work he put into the strategy and look forward to him putting it into practice.</P>
      <P>Literacy problems were mentioned. I remember begging the former Minister, Niamh Breathnach, for a classroom assistant for a class of moderately handicapped children and being refused. I remember the days when 72 schools in Donegal did not have a remedial teacher. Those days are gone. People are now looking for classroom assistants and resource teachers but things have improved greatly.</P>
      <P>In 1999, County Donegal was allocated 1,100 new housing starts for the 2000-03 programme. We already have those and we have now asked for more. Looking at the investment in new road projects, the LAS budget in 1996 was £265,000, while last year it was £1,347,788. For non-national roads in 1996, the budget was £11.5 million whereas now it is over £25 million. Statistics might be dull and boring but the facts remain.</P>
      <P>The motion states that the Government has failed to tackle the underlying problems affecting the quality of people's lives in spite of five years of unprecedented economic prosperity. One of the greatest achievements of the past five years is the peace process that this Government delivered. As a result of that process, many things now work on a cross-Border basis. To bring gas from Belfast to Donegal, £10 million has been invested. In May a car ferry will start traversing from Magilligan to Greencastle at a cost of £4.5 million. We have invested in Derry City Airport to extend the runway to bring in bigger planes that will help tourist access and assist business interests. We have invested more than £5 million to get a Dublin-Derry air service with a PSO. We hope the A5 and the Dublin-Derry train service will be next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say nothing has improved in the health service is scandalous. In Donegal, £1 million was spent on primary care facilities in 2000 for Moville, Buncrana and Clonmany while support has been given to the district hospital and James Connolly Hospital. The White Oaks Centre now offers residential treatment for victims of alcohol abuse. An Alzheimer's unit is being provided in Carndonagh, additional bed capacity in Letterkenny and a review of bed capacity in the district hospital. An ultrasound machine, holistic <Col N="702" /> breast care and chemotherapy services are being provided for Letterkenny, as well as new accident and emergency, oncology, haematology and breast care consultants. Specialist appointments have augmented acute services, with a 50% decrease in the waiting list from 2000 to 2001. There has been a 60% increase in ICU beds, an acute rehab unit has been commissioned and 52% of day surgery and service rates have been achieved.</P>
    <P>I could go on listing the achievements of the Government all night. I look forward to declaring our record to the public because although there is much to do, we have done a lot. People will see through this motion for what it is. If the Opposition had picked one topic it would perhaps be different, but to lump everything together because they could not say enough bad things about us to take up five minutes is a poor sign. I look forward to more substantial motions from the Opposition in future.</P>

      <P>There have been many comments on the negative motion tabled by the Opposition. When I was canvassing last Sunday morning, I was handed a parish newsletter. In this newsletter there was an article about negativity and how being negative can undermine others. The writer described how he was advised to stay away from negative people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>He continued that he has tried to take that advice. Like a computer virus, being negative affects all it comes in contact with. It is highly contagious. It continually emphasises the difficulties and problems of any project or line of action. Recently the writer found himself working with a very negative person who gave every reason why a particular project would never succeed. The people surrounding that person were themselves negative. This was not an accident, he said, but the virus spreading. That sums up the Fine Gael motion.</P>
      <P>Increased grants have come through for the group water schemes. The Minister has removed an anomaly where people in rural areas had to pay for their water supply. Now there are EU grants and local authority sources. The Federation of Group Water Schemes worked closely with the Minister to remove the anomaly and members of those schemes would like to see them taken over by local authorities. I commend the Minister for equity in the provision of water and charges. When the Minister last came to Galway, the deputation that came to see him wanted to thank him, not to ask for a new project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities completed 5,000 units of accommodation in 2001, the highest figure in 15 years, and started over 7,000 units last year, with <Col N="703" /> 6,000 more planned for this year. The disabled persons' housing grant has been increased three times since the Government came to office and now covers up to 90% of the cost of approved works for private houses. This grant previously covered only 75% of the cost.</P>
    <P>Heating provision for the houses of those with disabilities should be improved. In some local authorities, a grant of only 50% is available. That is not what the Minister intended and I would like to see the figure increased to 90%, as it is for all other works. The essential repairs grant and housing aid to the elderly are also excellent schemes where the grants have been increased. The Minister has delivered in the area of housing.</P>
    <P>Sewerage schemes have not been as successful but a design-build-operate scheme has been sanctioned near Portumna. Similar schemes should be put in place for the smaller villages in east County Galway. Many sewerage schemes cost &euro;1.3 million. Significant money is spent in major towns, such as the Mutton Island scheme in Clifden, and many schemes could be provided with such funding in smaller towns. We should move towards the provision sewerage schemes, which are so important, for our smaller towns.</P>
    <P>We have been very successful in County Galway in providing libraries. In April 2001, the Minister opened two libraries in the one day, one in Oranmore and one in Loughrea. Both are in beautifully restored church buildings. Libraries are planned for Eyrecourt and Inishbofin, we recently had a library opened in Killimor and there are plans for new libraries in Mount Bellew and Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>There have been difficulties at University College Galway which caters for Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, as well as County Clare, the midlands and parts of the north west. I am glad, however, the Government has bought Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe. There is a new wheelchair association centre in Tuam and the Government has also purchased the Bon Secours Hospital in Tuam, which we hope will be a community hospital. Step down accommodation is a big problem &ndash; if there was more hospital accommodation in our smaller towns, people would have more opportunities to leave the hospital in Galway city.</P>
    <P>I welcome the rail study and hope it will lead to a commuter link from Tuam to Galway as part of the Sligo-Cork line. Investing in the railways is cheaper than road infrastructure and commuters in the west want to have a service from Tuam to link with the Galway-Dublin line so there is a reliable rail system between Tuam and Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and to voice my concern about the Government's failure to build on the economic success of the past decade. As deputy Opposition spokesperson on health, I am concerned about the whole area of the health service. Having listened to Members on the benches <Col N="704" /> opposite preach for half an hour on the successes of the economy, it is an indictment of the Government and the Minister for Health and Children that the health service is in such a terrible state, with 26,126 people on waiting lists. In such an economic environment, it is extremely regrettable that people wait years for hip replacements, elderly people are denied the enjoyment of reading the daily newspaper because they must wait for cataract operations and those in need of surgical interventions feel obliged to contact public representatives in the hope of improving their place on the waiting list, which would mean unfairly moving somebody else down the list.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement with the medical bodies 40% of the population could be covered by medical cards, yet only 29% of the population has a medical card. Why has the full figure agreed with the medical profession not been met and the means test thresholds increased? I ask the Government to examine closely the Fine Gael proposals to double thresholds for medical cards and extend medical card coverage to everybody aged 65 years and over and 18 years and under. It is indicative of how the Government has neglected this area that 37% of the population was on medical cards when it took office.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, who has just left the Chamber, has an interest in this debate. The fact that we have 64,000 people in the education system with serious literacy problems is an indictment of the Government and society. We have built the success of our economy on our educational system by introducing excellence while totally neglecting those with literacy problems and those who, due to their social circumstances, do not have the opportunity to achieve a reasonable level of literacy and are unable to read the instructions on an aspirin packet. Given the higher likelihood that the families of people who are illiterate will also experience literacy problems, it is vital that we take a very serious approach to the problem. If we are to end the cycle of illiteracy, we must start somewhere and the earlier we start, the sooner we will get to grips with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I implore the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, as a fellow Limerick man who understands the education problems facing schools in east Limerick and, I hope, the rest of the city, to examine the need for investment in schools in Limerick west. I urge him to look across the border to Pallaskenry school where for 15 years children have been educated in prefabs, the roofs of which now have extra supports because of the danger they may collapse on the children. I ask him to announce before the election the start of the promised construction of Kilfinnane primary school and the extension works for Cappagh school, Scoil Náisiúnta Drumtrasna in Abbeyfeale, Gaelscoil Uí Doghair in Newcastle West and Christ the Saviour Church in Ballingarry. Although Charleville Christian Brothers School is outside the area, many people from Kil<Col N="705" /> mallock and surrounding areas travel to the area and they are extremely concerned about the lack of facilities in the school. I implore the Deputy, as a junior education Minister, to respond to the needs of Limerick west.</P>
    <P>For years, we in Limerick west have been promised investment in infrastructure, particularly the N69 coast road which has vast potential in terms of the development of the Shannon Estuary. Despite the Minister previously indicating that work would be done on it, we now learn that it will not take place in the foreseeable future. The road has the potential to contribute to job creation and the development of the Limerick side of the estuary.</P>
    <P>There are 200 acres of an industrial site in Askeaton awaiting development. The site is very near one of our more growing ports, Foynes, and the international airport in Shannon yet people will not invest in it because of the difficulties in road travel in the area. Just twelve months ago, the National Roads Authority addressed Limerick County Council and informed us that the Adare bypass would be completed within two years. We now learn that this project has been put on the long figure again which will inhibit travel between Limerick city and all areas west of it on the N7. This is extremely disappointing as Adare is a fantastic tourism product with vast potential, which is being hindered by the presence of heavy traffic on a major road through the village. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the Government's decision not to allocate funds to complete the project this year.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to re-examine Government policy on Shannon Airport which has been the hub, the driving force behind the development of the mid-west. Travelling from the United States recently, I was appalled that I had to over-fly Shannon, land in Dublin and wait an hour for an aircraft to return to Shannon. What kind of a message about Shannon does that give a person travelling to Ireland? This has grave implications for those considering developing in the area. Deputy Noonan, the future Taoiseach, has given a commitment to undertake a detailed, comprehensive examination of this matter and to return Shannon Airport to its former glory. I believe he will have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely important debate because it is possibly the last occasion in which the House will have an opportunity to discuss the stewardship of the Government. I want to speak primarily about traffic in Dublin city and its health services, particularly on the north side. If one examines the politician's role in relation to a problem such as Dublin traffic, it is primarily to provide leadership in order that change occurs, remove institutional barriers where they occur, set priorities and deadlines and to ensure that strategy is driven forward relentlessly and meets those deadlines. Against those standards, the Minister for Public Enterprise must be seen as the most dismal failure ever in dealing with traffic. <Col N="706" /> Nobody needs to be told that since this Government took office five years ago, ten million extra man hours per year are wasted by commuters in traffic, hours they did not have to waste five years ago. That is worth a conservative &euro;200 million and one could add the cost to businesses and other sectors bearing the price of congestion. One might say this is a problem of success and that we have to live with it in the Celtic tiger economy, but nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>The traffic problems in Dublin are largely the result of a lack of political leadership. There are institutions without the power to make change. There are needs that cannot be met because organisations not have the mandate to do so. We are suffering from hopeless political leadership on this issue. We have had heaps of talk and diagnoses of the needs but five years on we have no park and ride in Dublin, no integrated ticketing, no bus competition &ndash; supposedly the darling proposal of the Progressive Democrats &ndash; no real time information on public transport, no control of road openings which can happen willy-nilly during the day regardless of impact on business and no policy on heavy goods vehicles or managing traffic from the port or deliveries to commercial premises. This is because there has been nobody to lead. It is not up to the Minister to do all that work but she has failed dismally in not establishing a Dublin transport authority. This was to be one of the Government's flagships but five years on we are further away from having such an authority than we were at the beginning of the life of the Government.</P>
      <P>Many people expected the influence of the Progressive Democrats to ensure there would be an attempt to bring more choice into public transport services. What is happening is that the Minister for Public Enterprise is frustrating those in the private sector who want to provide an alternative. She tells them they can start out in Ashbourne or Dunboyne but once they reach an area where there is a Dublin Bus service they cannot pick up another passenger. Such buses travel past people at bus stops who want a service as they cannot take that business or tender for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only initiative developed in the last five years, albeit very slowly, was the quality bus corridor. What do we find at the end of that period? There are virtually no additional passengers using buses at peak times in comparison to figures for five years ago. It has failed to attract additional passengers from other modes of transport. That is not the fault of Dublin Bus but it has had huge implications for its finances &ndash; it has gone from a £5 million deficit to a £56 million deficit in just five years. That is the transformation. It is not getting passengers because the other policies which need to be in place to support a bus-based transport system are not in place. There are no park and ride facilities or real time information and we are not encouraging people to leave their cars at home by offering very cheap or free access at off peak times. We need to change attitudes to <Col N="707" /> public transport by making it an attractive, accessible alternative but instead the Government has done everything to frustrate the development of an attractive, alternative public transport service.</P>
    <P>Regarding the health services, I, like the Taoiseach, represent a northside constituency. We have two major hospitals serving our area: the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals. The waiting lists in the Mater Hospital, in one of the most deprived areas of the north inner of the city, since the Taoiseach took office have increased by 45%. In the last five years the Oireachtas has funded a doubling of the budget of the health services and the Minister for Health and Children has employed 15,000 extra people for the service, an increase of almost 25% in staffing. Yet today an accident and emergency service cannot be manned in the two premier hospitals in the country, Beaumont and the Mater, in the Taoiseach's constituency. We cannot provide a basic service so that people can get care in an emergency. One in six people going to those hospitals must wait over 24 hours on a trolley for attention. That is a standard experience; 30% of cases deemed urgent cannot be seen within four hours. Nurses are leaving in droves.</P>
    <P>In Beaumont last year 30% of nurses left the service because the Government has not delivered an environment in which they can practice their profession in the way they want and up to a standard of professionalism in giving care to people at their most vulnerable time. What has happened to those 15,000 people that we cannot spare some of them to man a decent accident and emergency service in Beaumont or the Mater? The Government produced a ten year plan for the health services at five minutes to midnight. Who is it fooling? I represent those constituencies and I have seen people sent home who are not fit to be out of hospital. I have seen consultants having to play God in Beaumont and decide who will get rehabilitation among six or seven patients who need it. No consultant should be put in that position.</P>
    <P>The Government is squandering the resources it has been given. We know 4,000 of those 15,000 recruits to the health services were administrators and fewer than 2,000 were nurses. Those people at the cutting edge trying to give services to our most vulnerable people have not been supported or resourced to deliver. The Minister for Finance will give this Government its epitaph: it is time to go out and party. It may be time to go out and party for the cronies that support the Government but if you are a vulnerable person waiting for health services on the northside or a child with remedial problems you need not look to this Government for solutions. You need to look for a change of Government and I am pleased that soon we will have an opportunity for a real debate on how the country's resources have been used. Can we provide a vision for the country where people look out for one another and where <Col N="708" /> we have decent values in core areas? That is the ambition, not to see the Bertie bowl, this celebration of sitting on one's backside looking at sports spectacles; it is to deliver real, decent services to people struggling to cope. That is what this election will be about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Deputies for sharing their time.</P>
      <P>It is obviously true that we have had prosperity in the last few years but we have had prosperity without fairness. There are huge gaps between rich and poor and they are growing. There are also huge disparities between economic development and the resources being put into the constituencies of Ministers as opposed to other constituencies. South Tipperary is an example of this. Significantly, we have huge levels of unemployment in the county and many of our towns have three or four times the national unemployment average. There are 1,000 people unemployed in Carrick-on-Suir, a town of 5,500, which is outrageous. Unemployment is at 15% in Tipperary Town. Unfortunately for us, those two towns were included in the recent study on disadvantage in the RAPID II programme as deprived towns which have lost out significantly in recent years. Parts of Clonmel were also named in the study.</P>
      <P>We have looked without success for decentralisation of Departments to south Tipperary, as Tipperary is the only county in Munster not to have such an office. Although it has been promised on four occasions in the past 18 months, it has yet to materialise. We have asked for advance factories. I accompanied a deputation from Carrick-on-Suir Urban District Council to a meeting with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last October or November, but we were given no indication that anything would be done for the town. It has not been suggested by the Government that County Tipperary should be given the priority job creation status it needs if it is to advance and become prosperous. Although Tipperary is known as the premier county, it ranks 22nd on the economic league table of counties.</P>
      <P>County Tipperary was one of the first counties to feel the effects of the swingeing cuts in the health service during Charles Haughey's time in Government between 1987 and 1989. We remember Fianna Fáil's election posters which said that &ldquo;health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;, but devastating cuts were introduced when that party returned to power in 1987. The consequences of the closure of St. Vincent's Hospital in Tipperary town are evident in the overcrowded corridors and accident and emergency departments of south Tipperary's hospitals, including St. Joseph's in Clonmel. Nurses, doctors and ancillary staff face huge pressures. There is no radiotherapy service for cancer patients in the south east and the CAT scanner promised by the Government has not been installed in St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it illegal that elderly people who <Col N="709" /> have given years of service to the State should be forced to pay for nursing home services to which they are entitled free of charge under health regulations. This situation should be reversed immediately. The housing aid for the elderly scheme has been abandoned for 2002 in south Tipperary as a result of a lack of funding and staff and it looks like there will be no scheme in 2003.</P>
    <P>New schools or extensions to existing schools are needed in many towns in my constituency, as children are being taught in old, leaking and decrepit buildings. I have asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on many occasions to sanction community gardaí but he has refused to meet the demand. The Cashel bypass has been stalled due a lack of funding and a bypass of Carrick-on-Suir is needed also. Additional moneys are needed for local road improvement schemes. About 1,000 families, or 5,000 people, are on local authority housing waiting lists in County Tipperary. There are 118 families on the waiting list in Cahir, a small town with a population of about 3,500 people. They will have to wait for about six years to be given a decent roof over their heads.</P>

      <P>The Government's failures, as outlined in this Private Members' motion, do not involve figures or cash amounts. The amendment to the motion would make impressive reading for a visitor from outer space, as statistics are listed and huge sums of money are mentioned. These boasts, however, bear no relation to the daily lives of the real people of Ireland. They mean nothing to a young married couple struggling with a crippling mortgage that forces them both to work and to leave their children who have to be cared for in an expensive crèche, if they are lucky enough to have one in their locality. The Government's boasts ring hollow to an elderly person waiting years for a hip operation or to an expectant mother whose local maternity unit has been closed and who has to make a long and hazardous journey outside her county to receive pre-natal treatment and to give birth. They are bitterly ironic to a seriously ill man lying on a trolley in an accident and emergency unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing figures mean nothing to a single mother and her child who have been on the housing waiting list for years, or to a family living in overcrowded conditions that beats a path in vain every week to the local authority's housing section in search of decent accommodation. A young couple starting out in life, unable to buy a modest home, will be astounded by the Government's claim to have moderated house prices and to have afforded greater participation in the housing market to first time buyers. A tenant in the private rented market facing an exorbitant rent increase or eviction will note that the private rented sector is not mentioned in the Government's amendment, as will his counterpart living in grossly substandard accommodation. Even this Government could not devise a positive spin to <Col N="710" /> put on its abysmal failure to protect tenants, given that more evictions are taking place now than was the case under British rule.</P>
    <P>Bundles of surplus copies of today's Order Paper could be supplied to teachers and parents of primary school pupils as they patch up crumbling classrooms and fill cracks in roofs and walls while waiting an announcement from Marlborough Street of when a building project will finally be sanctioned. Perhaps they will have to wait until this year's complement of pupils reaches voting age. The Government might consider posting copies of its amendment in my region to console those who see no prospect of the early delivery of the promised bypasses for Belturbet, Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Monaghan and Virginia.</P>
    <P>What has this Government done for counties Cavan and Monaghan? There has been no improvement in public transport in the region. Neither county is included in the phase 1 of the extension of the broadband network. The Government has not seen fit to locate a Department or third level college in my constituency. Local enterprises do not receive special aid, there has been no major inward investment and the health needs of my constituents are not recognised. That is the Government's record in the counties I represent.</P>
    <P>The ideology which drives this Government is expressed in the section of its amendment dealing with housing, which states that &ldquo;first-time buyers have been afforded greater participation in the housing market&rdquo;. The people of Ireland are citizens with rights, not merely consumers with buying power. They have a right to an equal place in society and decent homes and should not be confined to a niche in the cut-throat housing market, which has been designed by the Government for the profit of speculators.</P>
    <P>I look forward to presenting Sinn Féin's vision during the general election campaign, when we can put forward a real alternative to the failed policies of this Government and its predecessors. An Ireland of inequality has been created, but my party's goal, which is the aspiration of the overwhelming majority of Irish citizens, is that this country will become an Ireland of equals. Tacaím leis an rún; I support the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>A few short months ago, I outlined the Government's housing record to the House in response to another ill-informed Fine Gael motion. Let me remind them and bring them up-to-date on what we have done.</P>
      <P>In the past five years we have introduced a diverse range of measures to reduce house price inflation, increase housing output to meet demand, afford greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers, and improve affordability for first-time buyers and lower income households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took action on the tax front, including <Col N="711" /> adjusting the stamp duty system, to bring forward the supply of development land, remove speculators from the housing market and improve affordability for first-time purchasers. We also invested heavily in housing related infrastructure following years of neglect. On top of significantly increased investment generally in water, sewerage and roads infrastructure, we increased both the supply of serviced residential land and the more efficient use of that land through higher residential density. Strategic planning guidelines were drawn up on a regional basis for the Dublin and mid east regions and this is being replicated in other key regions throughout the country. We have also greatly expanded the capacity of the planning system by recruiting additional planners and increasing staffing at both local authority and Bord Pleanála levels.</P>
    <P>Currently there is about six years supply of serviced land nationally, in Dublin and in the greater Dublin area. This will improve further on foot of increased investment in economic infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage and public transport over the national development plan period. The shortage of serviced land for housing, which was identified as a key issue when we took office, has been fully and comprehensively dealt with.</P>
    <P>More than 52,000 new houses were completed last year, up almost 6% on the previous year, and it was the fifth consecutive year of record housing output under this Government. Early indications in 2002 are that we are on target for another year of record housing output as HomeBond registrations for the first two months of this year show an increase of 37.5% on the same period in 2001. Since we came into office some 216,000 new houses have been built, equating to about 18% of our total housing stock. By way of international comparison, we built more than 13 houses per 1,000 population in 2001, the highest rate in the EU in proportion to population.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has the audacity to lay the blame for increased house prices in the early part of our term at the door of the current Government. The reality is, and they know it, that the peak of some 40% in house price increases recorded in 1998 was due to their failed polices and inaction which, among other things, had resulted in an acute shortage of serviced land for housing. Since then, because of the measures we introduced, there has been a downward trend in house price increases. The average annual rate of house price increase has been reduced from the inherited peak of around 40% to about 5% or 6% last year.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of the Government has been to create space for first-time purchasers. First-time purchasers, I am glad to say, are now accounting for a larger share of the market, with applications for new house grants up by more than 7% in 2001 following an increase of almost 5% in 2000. All the evidence from mortgage lenders, auctioneers and the house builders themselves is that this strong performance by first-time buyers has continued into this year. <Col N="712" /> This is backed up by the level of new house grant applications in the first two months of this year which are up by more than 12% on the same period in 2001.</P>
    <P>The area of social housing needs has been a particular priority for this Government. The total funding provision for housing this year is &euro;1.7 billion, an increase of more than 20% on last year, which represents an increase of more than one third on 2000. The increased investment by this Government has allowed social housing to be delivered at record levels. Some 5,000 local authority houses were completed or acquired last year, the highest level of output for more than 15 years. Output under the voluntary housing programmes in 2001 was some 1,250 units, the highest level ever achieved by the sector. Accommodation was provided for an additional 333 traveller households in 2001, the highest level ever. In all, the social and affordable housing needs of more than 11,000 households were met last year.</P>
    <P>This Government also recognises the importance of the private rented sector. The measures we have introduced in budget 2002 complement the other reforms introduced on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector and are laying the groundwork to achieve our objective of a diverse, properly functioning and well managed private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion smacks of desperation. Over the last two nights my colleagues have shown the strength of our record on public transport, roads, health and education. Housing is no different &ndash; we are delivering on housing and our record of action stands in marked contrast to that of Fine Gael. Nothing the Opposition has said in the course of this debate has taken any of the gloss off the Government's achievements in this key area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what Government TDs had to say to the motion, all of whom expressed surprise that we were debating it and that they were being subjected to criticism. I too find it surprising and extraordinary that we are here in the dying days of the Dáil with a composite motion designed to condemn the Government on every front. In every area of public service it has failed to deliver. It is extraordinary because it had every opportunity and all the money. It tells us proudly that it is the longest serving Government the country has ever had since the war years. It has had all the opportunities. While nobody expects all problems to be solved overnight, it is inexcusable that in the dying days of the Government the plans, strategies and promises are being pushed out daily. Nothing was achieved in the past five years when, God knows, it had every opportunity to deliver. It had the money, time, expertise, skills and a dedicated young workforce full of enthusiasm. No generation ever had to work as hard or as long as this generation has been willing to work. By sheer <Col N="713" /> force of their will and enthusiasm they drove the country to a rate of prosperity we had not witnessed previously and yet the Government could not capitalise on the potential that offered.</P>
      <P>Instead, their reward has been a deteriorating quality of life and a deterioration in all the public services which impact directly on peoples' daily lives. We have had the catalogue of them, by speaker after speaker &ndash; health, education, transport, environment. What good is prosperity if it does not translate into a better quality of life and if people do not consider it has been worthwhile?</P>
      <P>It could be truly said of the Government that never has so little been achieved with so much. The Government has not been content just to fail to deliver services to squander the money of those few years. It is also working hard to destroy any potential there might have been for future growth. Lack of plans, strategies and the will to tackle the problems in an honest way has resulted in an alternative approach. Money was thrown at every issue raised without any strategy as to how it might be best spent. There has been no evaluation of outputs or analysis of the efficacy of any plan.</P>
      <P>Current spending has increased to 22%. What is the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and every member of the Government, who know the damage this can cause to the economy, doing by standing over that current spending without any thought for the future? How can they justify it when growth rates are, at best, 3%. It will get the Government over the election but it will not carry the country far. When it should have spent money it failed to do so.</P>
      <P>What happened to capital spending? What happened to the national development plan, to which so much lip service was given? How can the country capitalise on any upturn that may appear on the global economy such as the Central Bank suggested this evening may be happening? I welcome that. We are poorly poised to capitalise on it. The key to survival is the maintenance of competitiveness. We have nothing else going for us. We are a rock on the side of Europe and we have to be competitive. To be competitive we need to have the infrastructure. We know we have reached the barriers to expansion on every front during the years of prosperity. We must invest in infrastructure if we are to increase output and productivity. During the downturn in the economy, instead of engaging in anti-cyclical spending it engaged in pro-cyclical policies.</P>
      <P>The roads programme stopped completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority has had to display the greatest ingenuity in its report for this year in masking the fact that no progress has been made on the roads programme. There is just about enough money to maintain the two major projects in Dublin until the end of the year and nothing else is happening. Every product we use, sell, buy, import or manufacture must be transported by roads which go through the centre of villages, holding up traffic and endangering lives. How can a modern economy operate like this? <Col N="714" /> Almost five years ago the Tánaiste told us that within three or four years we would have highways to everywhere. At the end of five years we have a few kilometres here and there. Why are we stopping now when it was never more critical that we invest in our infrastructure? </P>
    <P>I agree with everything my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, said about the transport situation. I have had many battles with the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, about Luas, buses and many other issues. It is clear from the sixth and final report of the Luas advisory group that even the Government's new timetable for Luas will not be met. First, the Minister interfered because she did not have the will to forge ahead with a badly needed project. She listened to every bit of advice from anyone who had an interest in transport and eventually made a mess of the project. In 1998, when the Minister announced the metro project, one would have thought that only the drilling of a few bore holes would be needed to provide a metro system by the following Christmas. A gullible media almost believed her.</P>
    <P>This afternoon the new Rail Procurement Agency held an information launch for potential bidders for the metro, which I do not expect to see in my lifetime. The Government should not be left in charge of this project. It is a project of enormous proportions with huge potential for pitfalls. We have no experience of a public private partnership on this scale. I am not convinced the Government knows what it is embarking on and I have no confidence in its ability to manage it. Has the Government sought the necessary legal, commercial and accounting advice to ensure we get the best possible deal in this public private partnership? We are involving ourselves in a project of enormous risk. A project such as this involves huge risk in the areas of planning, archaeology, geology and construction. Nor do we know what the demand for the project will be. There are also operational risks. If the Government cannot organise a public private partnership to run a swimming pool, what hope is there for the metro project to be successfully managed? Has the Government even given the tendering process any consideration or brought in expertise? The Abbotstown project involved an exposure of £63 million but this project will involve billions. The Government's estimate is for £6 billion and it usually gets half way there, so we are probably facing a financial exposure of £12 billion. Even an exposure of only £6 billion has the potential to sink the country to its knees. We are facing into an enormous project and the Government has not given it a whit of thought. If there is any reason not to return this Government, this is it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise promised a communications Bill. Recent press statements from Deputy O'Rourke make it clear she is living in a fantasy world. She continues to fantasise that this country is the hub of the e-commerce universe. We were promised that it would be, but <Col N="715" /> there has been no investment in the necessary technology. Recently the Minister said we would have &ldquo;always on&rdquo; Internet access within weeks. This is fantasy. There is no regulatory framework for this, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has no power to enforce it and there is no plan as to how it will happen.</P>
    <P>Everything the Minister has touched has become a disaster. Even the ESB, a relatively successful company, was not allowed to invest in the infrastructure necessary to provide power for the west of Ireland to expand economically. For several years, millions of pounds had to be spent on emergency generators in case of a crisis in the electricity supply. The Minister is in charge of airports; they are a disaster. She has a complete inability to make a decision. She has promised so many improvements in public transport, including a Dublin transport authority and park and ride facilities. I have attended five separate launches of integrated ticketing plans. No decision has been made with regard to even one park and ride facility.</P>
    <P>Competition among bus companies is the single most important requirement for the survival of Dublin. It is the only thing which might make Dublin a viable city and which can be delivered with any degree of speed. Not only did the Minister not fulfil her promises, she thwarted those who tried to apply for commercial bus licences. Deputy Richard Bruton has spoken about the nonsensical licences that were eventually issued months after the applications were made. Some licensees were prevented from picking up passengers in certain places but, worse, they were prevented from setting down passengers. What is the sense in stopping people from getting off a bus where they want to or in taking people beyond their place of work? This makes no sense whatsoever and is part of a failed policy.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus on its own cannot provide the capacity or frequency required. Bus lane after bus <Col N="716" /> lane has been provided but there has been no analysis of their efficacy. We have fewer bus routes in Dublin now than we had five years ago and those which are left have been denuded of buses to provide vehicles for some of the routes which have bus lanes. I say some routes, because several routes which run on bus lanes have only a handful more buses than they had before they became totally dedicated lanes. One cannot use road space in this way unless it leads to the maximum delivery of passengers in peak hours and this is not happening. It is no wonder the commuting times have got longer and people feel their quality of life is being destroyed.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow, Fine Gael will launch its housing policy document. This area demonstrates the most abject Government mismanagement. Every housing policy of the Government has been reversed because it produced the opposite of the required effect. Housing lists have increased in every local authority area. There are 55,000 families waiting for housing with no hope of getting it in the foreseeable future. People who can buy houses have to buy them 70 or 80 miles from their original homes, losing all contact with family and the social supports that go with that. The Minister of State has the nerve to say the shortage of land is Fine Gael's fault. How did we manage that in the two years we were in Government over the past 15 years? This Government has failed the people because it has failed to fulfil the promise of the potential of the money, opportunities and time made available to it. It has wasted all the opportunities by mismanagement.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, or many of the other hard working Ministers but the Taoiseach who spent five years canvassing when he should have been in here making sure his Ministers were doing their job, that there were strategies and plans in place and that they were implemented. This Government has failed the people and they will not forget it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 24, after &ldquo;ENACTMENTS,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;TO AMEND THE INDUSTRIAL AND PROVIDENT SOCIETIES ACT, 1893, WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS THEREUNDER,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Last week on Committee Stage I indicated my intention to introduce on Report Stage an amendment to the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893. The purpose of this is to facilitate structural change in the co-operative sector and so deliver on a commitment given in the social partnership agreement of 2000. The amendment proposes to relax the voting requirements that apply to co-ops under section 51 of the 1893 Act for the purposes of effecting a change of name under section 52 of that Act and an amalgamation with, or transfer of engagements to, another co-op under section 53.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 43 is a substantive amendment. It was intended to introduce this amendment as part of a separate Bill to modernise industrial and provident societies legislation. However, the drafting of heads of such a Bill has been delayed. Given the mood in the House today, I am anxious to ensure that this Dáil approves the current provisions. Amendments Nos. 1 and 42 are consequential on the substantive amendment. Amendment No. 1 amends the Long Title of this Bill. Amendment No. 42 repeals the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1971, which is considered redundant in light of the substantive amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for making her briefing notes from her Department available on Committee Stage, albeit late in the day. It is surprising that this Bill should be so substantially amended at this late stage. There appears to be no other reason than the imminent demise of the Dáil. Whether long-term difficulties will arise because the House did not deem it prudent to introduce an industrial and provident societies (amendment) Bill, we do not know. However, I have no difficulty with the amendment and welcome the thrust of what the Minister said. It is important in the context of representations made by the co-operative movement, although it is unusual to see a Bill amended like this where two sections are substituted for an entire amending piece of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the amendment but, as Deputy Flanagan stated, this is not the ideal way to enact legislation. Our experience with this Bill has been unsatisfactory simply because of the timetable. It is unfortunate that a Bill, which is close to the Minister's heart, is getting inadequate scrutiny because we are in the dying days of the Government and there are other pressures on Deputies.</P>
      <P>We agreed to the Bill being processed because nobody in the House wants to obstruct measures that are designed to have a positive effect for consumers, whether in the stables of life such as bread and milk or something like concrete blocks. No one has a vested interest in restraint of trade or anti-competitive practices, but the Bill merits more scrutiny than we can give it tonight while the insertion in it of what is really a separate Bill at this late stage is unsatisfactory. However I will not object to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Government is under great pressure to enact this Bill in the run-up to the general election, but this legislation has implications for all trade and it is unfortunate that it is being guillotined. The Minister has taken on board amendments proposed by Deputy Flanagan and myself last week and the Bill will go through the Seanad tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority plays an important role but it has not yet made inroads into the development of commerce and trade. The authority ought to help competition as that is important for the development of trade and business.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte stated, the new section introduces further provisions, but I support my colleagues in not opposing it. This legislation has been discussed for years and it is unfortunate that we do not have more time to discuss its many amendments.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I accepted the principle of an amendment tabled by Deputies Flanagan and Perry to clarify the terms of sections 4(8) and 5(3).

      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 24 to 36.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment in the knowledge that the Minister will not have a change of heart at this late stage on this aspect of the Bill in which we are taking a major step. We are in a relatively new area of law and reversing the traditional burden of proof as, under this legislation, the Minister will incorporate a presumption of guilt. The onus will be on the defendant to prove that he or she is innocent. This is a rebuttable presumption which will have a major effect. The Minister has narrowed the implications of it by excising the word &ldquo;effect&rdquo; from the Bill as introduced into the Seanad, which is an improvement, but the defendant must prove other than the charge or else the presumption is one of guilt. Removal of that word means that it will be less unwieldy, expensive and shorter to establish the case to be brought, but it is a road that we should go down with some trepidation, notwithstanding the difficulty in bringing home charges in this area. It is likely now to be incorporated into other areas of law, but the Minister will probably not change her mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  In view of the concerns expressed about section 6(2), I looked at the drafting again to see if it were possible to tighten further the provisions and am now proposing amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, which make it clear that the presumption will apply only where the purpose of the agreement, decision or concerted practice is to fix price, share markets or limit output. An agreement which has a different purpose, but inciden<Col N="721" /> tally does one of these, is not covered by the provision. What is now provided is that where the purpose of an agreement, decision or concerted practice is to fix the price, share markets or limit production, it will be presumed that the object is the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition. I cannot think of a more reasonable presumption and, accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 4 which seeks to limit the provision.</P>

    <P>The fact that I was giving further consideration to sections 6(3) and 7(2) and seeking legal advice on the matter was signalled on Committee Stage. My immediate cause of concern was that the defence may not be consistent with the proper application of EU law, and one of the objectives of the Bill is to provide for Articles 81 and 82 to be applied by the competent national authorities. Having received advice from the Attorney General, I am now satisfied that the defence cannot be imported into the Article 81 or Article 82 prohibition. It may be possible to retain it in relation to breaches of sections 4 or 5 but I am not in <Col N="722" /> favour of doing so for a number of reasons. First, allowing the defence where national law is breached but where EU law is not breached would greatly complicate the enforcement regime.</P>
    <P>Second, I consider that the justification for such a defence has largely disappeared since it was included in our law in 1996. At that time, the criminalisation of breaches of criminal law was novel. There was uncertainty in the public mind as to the scope of competition rules and the defence provided some reassurances that the business people would not be at risk of jail for inadvertent breaches of the legislation. Things have changed considerably since then. We have a large body of authority decisions which clarify the scope and application of the law. The authority has issued guidelines indicating that, as a general rule, it intends to prosecute only for the more serious breaches of the law, essentially for cartel activities, and nobody could be unaware of the anti-competitive nature of such activities. Finally, this Bill eliminates jail sentences for less serious breaches of the law. Having regard to these developments, there is no continuing justification for the defence and I propose to delete it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan's amendment No. 11 seeks to exempt farmers and farmers' associations from the application of Article 81(1). It has been said that the proposed amendment mirrors an exemption that already exists in EU law. There is some truth in this but it is only part of the story. The wording of the proposed amendment is based on wording contained in Article 2(1) of Regulation 26/62 which establishes competition rules for the agriculture sector. Article 1 of that regulation provides that Articles 81 and 82 of the treaty, which contain the generally applicable competition rules, shall apply to the agricultural sector. Article 2 provides for certain exemptions from Article 81(1) which are limited in their application and have been strictly construed. Article 2(1) provides that Article 81(1) of the treaty &ldquo;shall not apply to agreements, decisions and practices of farmers, farmers' associations or associations of such associations belonging to a Single Market which concern the production or sale of agricultural products or the use of joint facilities for the storage, treatment or processing of agricultural products, and under which there is no obligation to charge identical prices unless the Commission finds that competition is thereby excluded or that the objectives of Article 33 are jeopardised&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is clearly based on this provision but crucially omits the qualifying phrases to the effect that the exemption operates only where &ldquo;there is no obligation to charge identical prices&rdquo; and &ldquo;unless the Commission finds that competition is thereby excluded&rdquo;. The article is clearly intended to legitimise the core activities of farming co-operatives but it specifically excludes from the exemption agreement decisions or concerted practices which fix prices or eliminate competition. I find it a little disin<Col N="723" /> genuous of the proposer that these critical qualifications of the exemption are not referred to in the proposed amendment. Regulation 26/62 is part of our law. It is directly applicable and can be relied upon by farmers' organisations. There is no need to repeat it in this Bill and I do not believe that I should, or that I am in a position to, provide for a broader exemption in the Bill as appears to be intended by the amendment.</P>
    <P>Farmers have a great deal to gain from competition law. Farmers are also buyers of products and services and the rigorous application of competition law can have a significant impact on their own costs. For example, the authority has acted to prevent vets from setting prices and is currently studying competition in the veterinary sector. The authority also took a lead role in the European Commission investigation into the worldwide vitamins cartel which, as with the famous lysine cartel, would have raised the price of animal foodstuffs. Farmers also have a considerable interest in seeing effective competition operate in many services markets such as banking and insurance, which significantly affect their costs.</P>
    <P>I have always responded quickly when farmers' organisations complained of unfair or anti-competitive practices, for example, when I established the independent group to examine anti-competitive practices in the beef industry or my intervention in the sugar beet dispute where farmers complained about the behaviour of a monopoly buyer.</P>
    <P>As for the Competition Authority, I am not aware of any situation where it has interfered with activities by farmers' organisations that comply with the provisions of Regulation 26/62. The chairman, who, like myself, comes from a farming background, will sit down with the farming organisations to discuss with them the application of competition law in that sector and how they can ensure their activities comply with the law. In these circumstances, I cannot accept Deputy Flanagan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that these amendments are being taken together because there is not much of a relationship between amendments Nos. 9 and 10 on the one hand and amendment No. 11, and it is clear from the Minister's contribution that there is no relationship between them.</P>
      <P>As far as amendment No. 10 is concerned, it appears we are removing what was a bona fide defence and in tandem with a rejection by the Minister of Deputy Rabbitte's previous amendment, we can see a further withering away of the position of a defendant. That should give rise to some concern. However, I wish to reserve the bulk of my contribution to my own amendment No. 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister, I am still concerned about the absence of specific reference in the legislation to the unique position of farmers as food producers. The Minister said, among <Col N="724" /> other things, that farmers had nothing to fear from competition but farmers have no choice in the matter of the Common Agricultural Policy. The whole thrust of the Common Agricultural Policy is not pro-competition but rather the preservation of a vibrant rural economy. That conflicts with naked competition in a way that presents the farmer with a major difficulty. It is not unreasonable that this competition legislation would have specific reference to the treaty articles, particularly EU Regulation 17/62 and 26/62. The amendment merely reflects in specific terms reference in the EU Regulation 26/62. We should have an explicit recognition in law of the right of a farmer organisation to negotiate on behalf of its members.</P>
    <P>The reality of Irish farming in 2002 is that farmers must combine to have a negotiating position. Allowing individual farmers a right to negotiate a price is merely reflective of a position of great weakness. We have given due recognition to farmer organisations and farm associations over the years, stitched in, as that group is, as a pillar of social partnership, which is something I very much welcome. Farm organisations constitute a bona fide social partner. If left to the harsh winds of the market, the individual farmer would be defenceless. He or she would be reduced to a position of great weakness and merely left as a price taker.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with this matter quite late in the day because of time constraints and rushed legislation and one of the difficulties is that we will not have sufficient time to deal with the fairly substantial consequences that could ensue. I do not accept the fig leaf that the Tánaiste offered by saying that the chairman of the Competition Authority will sit down with the farmers. That is absolutely meaningless in terms of a way forward or a need to recognise the right of the farm organisations to do what they have been doing quite successfully and of necessity on behalf of their members over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Unless specific reference is stitched into this legislation, a flimsy promise that talks will take place is little more than meaningless. I am not sure what avenue is open to the Tánaiste for a further review of this matter. I am not sure of the extent to which the Seanad will have an opportunity to debate amendments again, given that it has already done so. I impress on the Minister the need to engage in public debate on this issue. I know that she and her officials have been examining this situation, albeit behind closed doors. This is an important issue. Unless this Bill is amended along the lines of amendment No. 11, it will be damaging to farmers.</P>
    <P>Mr. Matt Dempsey, who is widely respected in matters rural and agricultural, said that this Bill represents a unique chance to stitch into Irish law practices and principles that are the norm in continental Europe. We are not asking for a specific exemption for Irish farmers or that the Irish producer should be treat differently from his or her European colleagues. We merely want to give <Col N="725" /> statutory recognition to EU regulations and make explicit reference in our national legislation to something that is the norm throughout the European Union. Without having such an assurance explicitly referred to in our legislation, we are putting farmers in a position of great weakness. To suggest that talks might take place is insufficient in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to review her stance and accept my amendment. She seems to suggest that the articles already have legal effect within our jurisdiction. If that is the case, then the amendment cannot be in any way harmful. My fear is that at some future date, a chairman of the Competition Authority who is not from a farming background, which could happen at any time in the future, could have a completely different view on this matter. The soundings from the Competition Authority before Christmas in the context of the beet dispute were sufficient to set off alarm bells throughout rural Ireland and in the farming community. I am most anxious that this amendment be pressed.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House that there is an error in this amendment. Rather than amending subsection (6) of section 8, it should amend subsection (7) of that section. The correct text, therefore, of the amendment should be as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 12, lines 34 to 36, to delete &ldquo;a director, manager or other similar officer of the undertaking concerned,&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;a director of the undertaking concerned or a person employed by it whose duties included mak<Col N="726" /> ing decisions that, to a significant extent, could have affected the management of the undertaking,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments arise from the Committee Stage debate. At that time, Deputies Rabbitte and Flanagan pointed out that the term &ldquo;manager&rdquo; was sweeping and could cover a person who holds a relatively junior position in an undertaking. Given the scale of the liability provided for in the Bill, I agreed at the time that it would be appropriate to limit the scope of these presumptions to those who hold senior positions in the undertaking concerned.</P>

      <P>The argument for making this amendment is similar to the argument I made about the appropriateness of this kind of presumption being made. I welcome the change made by the Minister in amendment No. 12. I was puzzled, in between watching Ian Harte score the first goal and going back to this Bill, about how this related to subsection 6 but all has now been revealed. It is an improvement and, as Deputy Perry says, it would be entirely wrong for someone who has the title of manager, but who could be a relatively lowly person in the enterprise, to be automatically presumed responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument in respect of my amendment is about whether it should be presumed that a person, defined as it now is &ndash; a person of some responsibility, admittedly, would have consented to the commission of the offence by the undertaking unless he can prove otherwise. To reverse the normal burden of proof is to place a huge responsibility on the person concerned. Notwithstanding the Tánaiste's having limited the import of the term &ldquo;manager&rdquo; or narrowed its scope &ndash; it could have had a very wide sweep in its application &ndash; I do not know why the prosecution should not be required to prove what is being asserted here rather than the assumption being made that the person can somehow automatically <Col N="727" /> be presumed to have consented to the commission of the offence that is contemplated by subsection (7).</P>

      <P>The arguments are similar for this amendment. I do not know whether a person can be held vicariously liable for a criminal offence or whether that would stand a constitutional test. I do not know why the jury cannot be allowed to decide. Subsection (5), for example, does away with the requirement for proof:</P>
      <P>Where an authorised officer who, in the exercise of his or her powers under section 45, has removed one or more documents from any place, gives evidence in the proceedings under this Act that to the best of the authorised officer's knowledge and belief, the material is the property of any person, then the material shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to be the property of that person.</P>

This is entirely contrary to the concept of due process. Notwithstanding the difficulties of which we spoke on Second and Committee Stages, I do not think that one can discard the presumption of innocence and the constitutional right to due process, the right to examine and cross-examine or to probe and question. These fundamental rights appear now to be seriously diminished, if not altogether wiped out. I feel that great difficulty will result from this and I question its wisdom.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Central Bank shall have a right of action under this subsection in respect of an abuse which is prohibited under <i>section 5</i> or by Article 82 of the Treaty.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to open this debate again. The Minister's views are fixed. I am not sure if she has changed anything since last Friday evening. Perhaps I should have requested in subsection (3) that other regulators &ldquo;may&rdquo; have a right rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; have a right. This issue will arise in the future as we expand and develop the importance of regulators in the telecom and energy areas. There will be many such areas and that is to be welcomed. The maintenance of a monopoly for the Competition Authority will have to be changed. It may be some years before we return to this legislation. We should leave the door open to enable regulators to engage in the type of activities that are very much consumer orientated.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the consumer imperative in this legislation is vital and it runs right through the Bill. Opening up, empowering and enabling the regulators to act in the interests of the consumer is of great importance. I had hoped the Minister was not as rigid on this as she appeared. We should provide that regulators may have such a power rather than imposing the requirement on them. I would stake money on this and say these powers will be given to regulators within the next ten years. The consumer will require it and the legislation would be all the better if we did this.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Flanagan on this very important point. The role of the regulator has been developed in recent years. The Competition Authority has not, up to now, been empowered to do a great deal. Competition is very important and by virtue of its name, the Competition Authority should also face competition. The development of competition is of benefit to the consumer. It is important, given that so many decisions in this area are made outside this House, that we embrace all the regulatory authorities and ensure they are given a competitive edge. The Competition Authority should be able to withstand public scrutiny. It will be the ultimate body with all the say. The position of regulator has been developed by Government. The Minister is inhibiting its power by not agreeing to Deputy Flanagan's amendment. That will happen in the years to come.</P>

This could be particularly injurious to the development of newly liberalised markets as legal uncertainty is likely to deter entry to those markets.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the Competition and Mergers Review Group considered the issue and concluded that the authority should retain exclusive jurisdiction to administer competition law in all sectors in the economy.</P>

      <P>I spoke about the concept of exemplary damages on Committee Stage and the Minister ruled it out of hand. The more I think about it, the more appropriate I think it would be. Reading back over recent case law, juries have awarded exemplary damages and the concept, in terms of exemplary damages being associated with punitive damages, has developed whereby the court awards an amount of compensation arising out of an injustice, the taking away of a person's rights or a person whose right is vindicated through the courts being awarded an amount of punitive damages in recognition of the damage done rather than receiving general or special damages which are awarded through the courts on a daily basis. It is important that we develop the concept of exemplary damages.</P>
      <P>I was rather interested in the comments made by the sitting judge in the celebrated case of Geraldine Kennedy, where the concept of exemplary damages was adjudicated upon in the court. It was interesting to see how the concept developed over the years. That was one of the last times the court had an opportunity to stitch into the record a written published judgment of what is meant by exemplary damages. There will be cases of abuse under this legislation and court actions will vindicate consumers' rights. An appropriate measure of damages could be &ldquo;exemplary damages&rdquo;. I have no options because we are at the end of the road. My proposal is reasonable and it should stand, even though it does not have much chance of success.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 3, after &ldquo;effect&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;and the Minister has not by order prohibited the merger or acquisition in the public interest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There was a reasonable discussion on this amendment on Committee Stage. It relates to section 19, which imposes certain limitations on mergers and acquisitions coming into effect. I seek to insert what I described on Committee Stage as a fall-back provision, whereby the Minister could prohibit a merger on public interest grounds which had been cleared by the Competition Authority on competition or economic criteria alone. I chose to raise this particular dimension of the overriding public interest. There are a few other sections in the legislation where similarly it could be raised but this area is suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not envisage that the provision would be frequently invoked but it would retain a power for the Minister, notwithstanding the Competition Authority having authorised a merger on competition criteria, whereby she could veto it in the public interest. On Committee Stage I pointed out the only two OECD countries that I <Col N="735" /> could find which did not retain this power in their legislation are Norway and Iceland.</P>
    <P>I drew attention to the remarks on Second Stage by the Tánaiste's colleague, Deputy O'Malley, who said that confronted with the choice he would not give away all his powers in this regard. The Competition and Mergers Review Group similarly assumed that the Minister would retain this residual power and recommended accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am not persuaded by the arguments the Tánaiste has advanced as to why we could not leave that in the legislation. Provided a decision was transparent and had to be explained and so on, I cannot see why we would not be willing to defend it in the House. The general point has been made about diminution of democratic accountability whereby powers that in simpler times were reposed in the Minister and for which the Minister had to answer in this Chamber have been taken away and allocated to one quango or another. Similarly in this case the powers are allocated, with the exception of the media, to the Competition Authority, which does not take public interest criteria into account. The authority makes these decisions on competition or economic criteria alone.</P>
    <P>The public interest does not feature at all and I believe it is not difficult to envisage a circumstance where on economic criteria the Competition Authority would say &ldquo;Yes, go ahead&rdquo;. However the demands of society and the judgment of the Minister of the day could be otherwise and he or she might want to veto the merger. Nobody is arguing in favour of allowing mergers that could be anti-competitive. The Minister would have residual power to veto a merger in the circumstances I have described.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in amendments Nos. 28, 30, 33 and 34. In support of Deputy Rabbitte's comments, the necessity for a definition of the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; is very clear. The Title of the legislation makes reference to obligations that arise in regard to our membership of the European Union, related treaties and the public interest. It is best to give a practical example of the way in which amendment No. 28 would work.</P>
      <P>If one is talking about competition between media forms as a commodity, one might be able to find grounds in which the products standing alongside each other in a market sense have not been interfered with and it would be possible to remove a distortion from the market. It would not be in the wider public interest, however, for there to be a monopoly in the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 invites the Minister to retain the residual power of the wider public interest, which would have practical considerations, such as the right of citizens to watch a significant sporting event. Citizens have a right not to be abused by a monopoly in relation to sporting rights and the right to expect the European Broadcasting Union to secure rights to European <Col N="736" /> events. These are beyond the commodity regime and the operation of a company which might own some rights and be in competition with another company bidding for such rights. The rights that arise are rights of citizenship &ndash; they exist in the European Convention in the right to communicate. It is in that sense that one uses the wider public interest. It may well be that the Minister might find some rare occasion when a monopoly is threatened that would rob people of diversity of editorial opinion and coverage. One might want to consult the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, or whatever Minister has responsibility for broadcasting, because the broadcasting Minister has to take into account issues beyond the notion of media as a commodity. Having consulted the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting, even as defined by the Minister herself in amendment No. 34, one could then say that Government would consider it was not in the public interest to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 30 suggests that when such a consideration has been brought to bear, there would be a statement explaining why it had been invoked, or in the opposite case, the Minister would make a statement to both Houses of the Oireachtas, setting out the reasons in the public interest the merger or acquisition should proceed. That is an important power to retain, not just for the Minister responsible for this area of competition. It recognises that the competition regime is within its furrow but there are wider considerations that make it worth retaining.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The media retains powers, subject to Oireachtas approval. I said last week if someone could give me a good example I might be inclined to keep such a provision, but in 24 years it has not been used and that is the best test. The lack of precedent in this jurisdiction raises the key question whether the public policy criteria should be retained other than in relation to media mergers. In addition, while a large number of OECD countries use public policy criteria as part of their regulatory regimes, there is no such criteria in the EU merger regulations which the Bill mirrors in many respects. This regulation is applicable to largescale mergers which impact across the EU and, in some cases, world-wide. These mergers are decided on pure competition grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many examples where ministerial influence on particular decisions has been shifted to independent bodies. We are shifting the power in relation to mergers to the Competition Authority so it will be decided purely on competition grounds. Inquiries under the Companies Acts now go to the Director of Company Law Enforcement. The work permits regime in the new legislation approved by the Government yesterday will go to deciding officers and be dealt with on an independent basis. The important role for Ministers and legislators is to decide the policy but the decisions on the day to day operation of that policy should be made on an independent basis. Due to the exceptional circumstances that <Col N="737" /> exist in media mergers, because of the impact of the media in a democracy and the importance of diversity and plurality of ownership, we are retaining for media mergers only power for the Minister to have the ultimate say subject to the Oireachtas approving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the low profile competition policy has had in this jurisdiction over the years, I am not sure if the fact that this matter did not arise in 24 years is a compelling argument. It is likely there will now be decisions of the Competition Authority in a more rigorous fashion than one ever had before. I cannot see the argument against retaining a residual power in the public interest. No one obliges the Minister to reach for it every time a merger is approved. Why would she be afraid? Ministers made decisions in the planning area, made omissions in competition policy, and other decisions were made in other areas that were improper, unwise or wrong. We live in a democracy, however, and a Minister should be able to stand or fall on his or her ability to defend that position and if the Opposition of the day cannot hold the Minister accountable, it is a pity, but that is the way it is. To divest herself of all powers to the competition authority, except in a narrow area of the media, is unnecessary. I do not have the mergers review group report with me but we adverted to the relevant paragraphs on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We will regret this. We tend to view this in terms of the politics of the Minister holding the brief but we cannot do it that way. We have to take the risk that, whatever the politics of the Minister, he or she will exercise the power in the public interest and if not he or she will be held to account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>With new technology it is important that the Minister would retain this power. Television pictures can be transmitted even through a telephone line and modem. It is equally important for business that there are not too many restrictions but the media is different because the players are multinational and Ireland is a small entity. There should, however, be competition between companies making acquisitions in a European market and people should be able to enlarge their businesses without restrictions. The same goes for companies coming from Europe into Ireland. That is the free market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is an expert on digital broadcasting and has clearly stated the potential abuses that could take place with dominant players in the market. It is not good enough that the consumer has to take whatever he or she can. The Government is finding it difficult to even find the money for the policy introduced by Deputy Higgins when he was Minister because of the turmoil in broadcasting in this State. Although we are dealing here with totally different circumstances, it is nevertheless important that the Competition Authority has the freedom to make decisions on business <Col N="738" /> quickly. If there is to be an investigation, there should be a timescale. As we have a fast moving economy in which people have money to invest and will not hang around, it is important that we proactively support business. I hope the Competition Authority, once empowered by the Minister, will do this, will receive excellent back-up by public servants and will be accountable to the Minister. People do not want to get lost in red tape and indecision. I fully agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins' point on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party supports the amendment. It is not wise for the Minister to divest herself of a public interest dimension and it is very important it is retained for the reasons outlined. If the section has not been used for 24 years, it is not likely to be a threatening section, cause the Minister difficulty or give rise to problems in her Department. There are circumstances in which a public interest imperative should be evident and this is one of them.</P>

      <P>Nobody has put forward a good public interest reason for retaining this section. I indicated last Friday that I might take another view if somebody gave me a good example of this. Essentially, my argument is that mergers should be decided on competition grounds. Competition is good for consumers and is paramount in my decision on this matter. It changes things much faster than anything else, delivers products and services at better value for money and increases the choice and quality available. For these reasons, competition should be the criterion and the competent authority on competition matters is the Competition Authority.</P>

      <P>In page 25, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Minister shall prohibit a merger or acquisition if the effect thereof is to enable an entity with an interest in more than 20 per cent of a particular media market to obtain an interest in more than 20 per cent of another media market.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section relates to media mergers, an issue touched on by the Tánaiste in response to my colleagues, Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Perry. The arguments about why the media ought to be treated differently have been well rehearsed, so I will not go over them again. I understand the Tánaiste accepts the argument that the media is different from other sectors in terms of the maintenance of competition, diversity, plurality of view, independent political coverage, the influence on our politics and democracy and a whole range of other arguments with which we are all familiar and have gone over from time to time.</P>
      <P>The difference between us appears to have narrowed to the way in which I am trying to give expression in the Bill to the requirement to insert a threshold beyond which the Minister would prohibit a merger in the media sector. I suggested a figure of 20%. From memory, the Tánaiste's response seemed to be that she does not disagree in principle, but finds it difficult to define the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tabled another amendment which seeks, perhaps in a crude way, to define &ldquo;media market&rdquo;. I am happy to signal I will withdraw amendment No. 35 if it impedes discussion of amendment No. 33, which is important. As politicians, we have discussed this issue for many years and <Col N="740" /> sat back as a level of concentration of ownership in this area aggregated to an unhealthy point. The Tánaiste has indicated many times since taking her brief that she would address the question of cross-ownership in the media once legislation on this sector was introduced. Unless she introduces a threshold, she will have failed to do so. The rate of change in this area is dramatic and the prospect of someone acquiring a dominant position, not only in the old media, but also in the new media, is a realistic one.</P>
    <P>I do not mind if the threshold differs from mine. The print-audio-television boundary is the one that matters in terms of the political health of society and there may be other areas where the level of the threshold may be less important. I am flexible on this matter and have no difficulty with the Minister regulating or calibrating it as she feels necessary depending on the market in question and other factors.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is giving everything else to the Competition Authority and it possesses the expertise and genius she has ascribed to it during the passage of this legislation, why not let it define the media market and advise the Minister on what constitutes a market in particular cases? Without a percentage threshold, however, the measure is toothless and we will remain as inert as ever on the issue.</P>
    <P>I am not certain which section of the Bill introduces the concept of substantially lessening competition &ndash; I believe it is section 20(2)(<i>a</i>). That seems a very elastic concept &ndash; unless there is a significant lessening of competition &ndash; and seems very much in the eye of the beholder. One could choose not to see a significant lessening of competition if one were so minded and we would be very much in the old regime. One Minister may see a significant lessening of competition while another may argue that the lessening of competition is not significant at all. It is an elastic concept and the promise the Tánaiste held out &ndash; to address the question of concentration of ownership and cross-ownership of the media and its significance for politics and democracy &ndash; will not be done unless we take this amendment on board.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this. Regarding the arguments we have made, one feels more strongly about some than others, but I feel strongly about this, as it goes to the heart of the issue. I will not rhyme off the figures regarding ownership of the media in Ireland. We all know them and different political parties will have different views about them. The British Government published a Bill yesterday on this issue which I have not yet had a chance to read. One cannot ignore the elephant in the room any longer. This is a big issue and needs to be addressed. If the legislation does not contain some percentage threshold, calibrated, variable or otherwise, it is not very meaningful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's points are very important. It is in the public interest that there should be diverse media ownership and increased concentration of ownership must be reviewed. <Col N="741" /> For example, the new ADSL technology means that a simple phone line may become a channel for the transmission of data and programme material. Given that currently one company has interests in local and national print media as well as cable and telecommunications, it is critical that we examine any increased consolidation of media mergers in future.</P>
      <P>The fact that this is a confined market is the hub of the situation, as Deputy Rabbitte pointed out. Competition is very important and makes for good business but this is a very expensive business to get into. It is one for multibillionaires so there are very few players. I am a great believer in new marketeers and the adage that from small acorns mighty oaks grow, but there are very few acorns that can grow in this area as it is monopolised by big companies with unlimited access to funds.</P>
      <P>Communications is the hub of a free democracy and open society. It is important that that continues in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment and there are two grounds for supporting it.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the concept of citizenship and the fundamental nature of the right to communicate. That right requires diversity in editorial opinion. That is one argument but there are others and if one does not include something like this it makes a mockery of the notion of competition. It does not assist competition to create new monopolies. This is precisely what has happened.</P>
      <P>Regarding the invocation to the European competition regime, Commissioner Monti was instructed by the European Parliament to address the issue of concentration of ownership in the media. He did not do so and the European Parliament criticised him for that. Why did the European Parliament come out so heavily in favour of broadcasting and the media generally as being separate from a commodity regime? One after another, speakers in the European Parliament said they wanted people to have the right to tell their own story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sticking with the arguments, as this is a competition Bill, if one allows a monopoly to prevail, to which we are very near in relation to some forms of media ownership, as Deputy Perry said it is impossible to have new entrants in the field. For example, of all the films watched in the European Union, no country of the 15 watches less than 93% US films. One cannot get a film circulated or distributed in Europe without taking five other films in a basket, which is a clear abuse of the market relationships when it comes to film. Regarding the exercise of abuse when it comes to new entrants, as Deputy Perry mentioned, there is no successfully commercial film now which spends less than 30% on its marketing budget, which makes it impossible for young filmmakers to enter the field. One can see that, in the name of the new regime, one does not find the State <Col N="742" /> getting out of the way to create a whole series of competitive new entrants but the State getting out of the way so that monopolies can emerge.</P>
    <P>For example, the Kirch company bought the rights to the World Cup and the Olympics at one stage, which meant the European Broadcasting Union lost its power and that purchase rights lean on national broadcasters so heavily that it is almost impossible for them to function. One cannot say this is something on which one should stay silent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has left the Chamber but she wanted practical examples. The Tory backbench committee in the House of Commons met to discuss media ownership in Britain and came up with a figure of 25%. The Minister could say she will not agree with Deputy Rabbitte's 20% but that she will agree to the Tory figure, 25%. That was their proposal as a result of the concentration of ownership in Britain. Also, how can anyone not address the issue of cross-ownership in a competition Bill? A person can advertise their newspapers through television and push their television programmes in newspapers. Once one starts operating across the fields of different media, one could list a string of possible abuses, particularly as there are no thresholds in each individual media, which is compounded geometrically by the abuses possible when committed in a cross-media way.</P>
    <P>One hears people say that it is only a matter of volume in the media and that one should ensure it stays fluid. I cannot see how one can say that there can be open season in relation to this with no upper limits. The Tánaiste asked for practical examples. She should look at the Australian legislation, which is from a right of centre Government. I could name eight or nine countries with right of centre Governments which have found it necessary to operate thresholds. Some have very deep prohibitions on cross-ownership, for many different reasons, but they all amount to the same thing.</P>
    <P>In Sweden, a member of the European Union, the managing editor of the second biggest newspaper resigned rather than function as editor when his newspaper was merged with the other leading Swedish newspaper on the basis that he would not be party to the destruction of editorial diversity in Sweden. To say that it is in the public interest in any way to allow a monopoly affects citizens, writers, artists and those who want to enter the field and that is very important. The justification, which I have heard before, is that one is able to draw a distinction between ownership and editorial control, as if ownership does not matter. Every media analyst suggests that this is a myth. In any of the countries in which studies have been carried out, the notion of concentration of ownership leans heavily on whatever media one is discussing.</P>
    <P>I can give another example of the domination of the market in relation to television. About 76% of animation products is controlled by a single company and sold into a single television <Col N="743" /> monopoly in Europe, where its distribution is restricted for the rest of Europe. It is a recipe for the destruction of diversity to say that a person can function in television, radio or the print media without an upper limit and that there should be no restrictions on cross-ownership. Not only will citizenship and cultural rights be severely damaged if we do not impose limits, but it would be stupid in competition terms. The industry will become heavy and monopolised and new entrants will be blocked. Young film makers cannot get their films distributed and new entrants to the print media find it difficult as a result of the scale, use and abuse of technology.</P>
    <P>Earlier I suggested a limit of 25% on ownership of a single media if we are to be in line with the recommendation of the British Conservative Party. It is proposed that anyone who owns over 25% should not be eligible for other forms of cross-ownership. Deputy Rabbitte is suggesting 20%, but I am sure he would be amenable if the Minister proposed a change to 25%. If this amendment is defeated there will be no limit, which would be massively against the public interest.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the arguments made by Deputies Higgins, Rabbitte and others. I said last Friday that no section of this Bill was discussed for more time than this one and on Committee Stage I pointed out that it is hard to define the market in this area. I can best explain the Government's policy by citing the example of the Examiner Group, with which we are familiar and which accounts for 16.5% of the market. This figure rises to 17.5% if the UK titles are excluded. There are two evening newspapers in this country, the <i>Evening Echo</i>, which has 21% of the market and is concentrated in Counties Cork, Limerick and Kerry, and the <i>Evening Herald</i>. The Examiner Group's newspapers have 16.5% of an identifiable market and Deputy Rabbitte proposes that this figure should not be allowed to grow to beyond 20%. I wonder if this is realistic, especially as the group's evening title has over 20% of the market.</P>
      <P>Having looked at the issue and having taken advice from officials and others, I came to the conclusion that the most effective way to ensure more competition is to examine the matter on a case by case basis. I strongly agree with Deputy Michael Higgins that there is a link between ownership and content, although certain journalists would argue that it is not the case. If we were starting from a greenfield situation and the Irish media did not exist in its current form, perhaps we would do things differently. We have to look at where we are today, however, and ask if it would be anti-competitive and contrary to plurality of ownership and diversity to stop the Examiner Group's Irish markets from growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crux of the issue is the definition of the market. As I said last week, there are daily, weekend, tabloid and provincial markets, so it is hard <Col N="744" /> to define the overall market. Among the newspapers which comprise the evening newspaper market, it could be argued that while the <i>Evening Herald</i> caters for the national market, the <i>Evening Echo</i> is confined to a provincial market in Counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick. It is almost impossible to define the market in legislation. The relevant criteria, in section 23 of this Bill, were adopted from the report of the commission on the newspaper industry, which looked at these matters in the mid-1990s. I wish to emphasise that I considered the matter at great length before deciding to pursue this course of action, in order to achieve the outcomes and aims desired by Deputies Rabbitte, Michael D. Higgins, Flanagan and Perry. While we do not disagree on this matter, the proposal to fix the percentage of a single media which may be owned is not the best means of achieving the competition and diversity we seek in the media, which is an important tool in any democracy.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's reply, as I honestly do not think that this section of the Bill will be effective without the insertion of percentage thresholds.

      <P>If she takes on board the fact that I have withdrawn my other amendment, as well as my decision to leave it to the Competition Authority to define whether a market is regional, provincial, national, daily, evening or broadcast, she may agree that she would have the power to act if the Examiner Group decides to do X. If it decides to do Y, however, she may choose to encourage it. I have spent the last couple of days reading Cabinet papers in relation to another controversy which involves the Tánaiste. I am sometimes surprised when matters erupt into the public domain to hear about the arguments that have taken place behind the scenes. I presume that arguments have taken place in relation to this matter at Government level and that the dominant coalition partner decided not to tolerate thresholds. If this is true, the dominant partner has abused its position, a position which I would like to end. It seems that the larger Government partner does not want to address this question for partisan reasons. On the other hand, the Minister, Deputy Harney, promised to address this matter and, without meaning to be mean-spirited, it could be argued that the former leader of her party would have insisted that the question of thresholds be addressed if he were still in that role. The concept of significant lessening of competition will be read by the Minister of the day in the most innocuous way possible and will facilitate a no-action stance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I have to make in relation to the Minister's observation on this amendment is that she seems to agree with the general principle. I have given many examples, to which I can add that of the Italian Government a few years ago, which examined the empire of Silvio Berlusconi. It decided not only to impose a limit, but to break up Mr. Berlusconi's empire because of his abuse of his position, an abuse that has since resumed. I fail to see how the Minister proposes to implement her agreement with the Dáil. She suggests we have a consensus and I accept that none of us wants a monopoly in the media but how will she bring this measure into effect unless she puts a limit on ownership? In regard to media markets, there is a concentration of ownership and there is a fragmentation of audience. In other words, those who manage to have a monopoly are segmenting the market and then acquiring a dominant position in it. This is certainly happening in relation to specialist television broadcasting. That means one can hardly ever get it back.</P>
      <P>I suggest that something else is happening and there is a great fear in Europe about this. If one were trying to introduce a Bill to address diversity not only in Ireland but in Europe, one would be going for upper limits. The business of defining the market is not difficult. I could suggest other ways of doing it. There is one company that controls just about 80% of all the print ink used in a particular week in Ireland. One could then ask who is reading its product. It is not a matter of saying whether a company has 16% or 21%, the issue relates to the prospects of diversity continuing, or being deepened or enhanced. Surely that is what we expect from competition. I have never been conned by that because I have never believed in pure markets. They do not exist nor does perfect competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had an opportunity to closely examine Monti's proposals in Europe. Monti's achievement was in destroying State regulation, standing back and allowing new destructive monopolies in every form of the media to merge in Europe. If one speaks with the association of newspaper editors in Europe, film directors, radio producers, those who work in the area, they will all tell one the same story. People who want to do their intellectual or creative work or write stories from different perspectives are all damaged by a monopoly. There is only one thing that will put manners on it, that is to simply say that if one decides to have a significant section of one media one will <Col N="746" /> not be able to move across to another media and own it.</P>
    <P>The other point I did not address is cross-ownership abuse, which occurs right, left and centre. If one wanted to look at the manner in which Murdoch abuses his position &ndash; I will not be provocative so late at night about who his friends are &ndash; but he advertises using one channel to sell another. The abuses that emerge where there is no threshold are compounded geometrically when cross-ownership is allowed because people can make it impossible for new entrants to emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made an example of the Examiner Group which owns a considerable amount of the provincial press. Together with local radio and the Independent Radio and Television Commission there is much cross-ownership with the provincial and national press. There are few players here. Most of the provincial press is owned and bought out by one company, even though the<i> Leitrim Observer</i> name will be retained. The position has changed completely. We are a small player in the European context. Deputy Higgins referred to diversity of ownership, free trade and competition which is similar to retail trades. The print business is a privileged business in which to be involved. Its progression during the past five years has been a buy-out and everything that has come on the market has been bought by the same players. That is an indication of the profitability of the business. Some provincial newspapers want a sense of ownership and identity and have a belief in where they come from and refuse to sell.</P>
      <P>With the Independent Radio and Television Commission and licences within the State, a huge consortium of which are part of the same message, opposition is good but equally important is that in ten years' time this business would not be controlled by two people in the State. We are talking about the island of Ireland where the marketplace should be distinctly different from anywhere in Europe or the UK. Deputy Rabbitte made the point that it is a good safeguard while the Minister referred to <i>The Examiner.</i> The example of <i>The Examiner</i> does not stand up because she gave examples of <i> Irish Echo </i>and an evening paper in Dublin. The economy of scale does not reflect on the readership throughout the country. I ask the Minister to reconsider this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we have gone through most of these arguments before, I have not been overly intervening because of the late hour. In case Deputy Rabbitte is in any doubt, the proposal I am following in the Bill is something I signed up for after consulting not only with my officials and following recommendations from the newspaper industry, the review group of mergers but others to whom I have spoken in the area who have much expertise, practitioners, in the field. I wish I could find a way to achieve what we all want to achieve. In case there is any doubt that I am somebody's puppet, I assure Deputy Rabbitte and others that this Bill has been promoted by me and has not been changed by any <Col N="747" /> member of the Government. The Government has signed up to what is in the Bill and nobody has sought to change its proposals. I put that on the record because it is important to do so.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out to Deputy Perry that the Examiner Group is a good example because it has 21% of the evening paper market. This amendment provides that it could not grow to more than 20% of the daily market. It has 16.5% of that market at present. If one were to define the market, excluding the UK titles, it has 17.5%. Effectively, what we are saying is that the Irish Examiner Group could not grow to be much bigger because it has 21% of the evening market. That is not in anyone's interest and would not be in the interests of competition in this sector.</P>
      <P>It appears strange that we are arguing the Minister should retain this residual power in the public interest from time to time, although it has not been used for the past 24 years. When we say we are introducing particular criteria in respect of media mergers because of the special position the media has in a democracy &ndash; one of the hallmarks of a democracy is a free press &ndash; we are adopting exceptional criteria that goes way beyond economic matters and strict competition criteria and are leaving a residual power with the Minister that is subject to parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary approval. In some sense that is not good enough. If we were starting from a greenfield site perhaps we could start with something like this. If there was real competition in this economy historically, we might not be in this situation. Competition law here is only ten years old and enforcement powers are only five years old. Competition is in its infancy in Ireland. Unlike the United States, competition in Ireland has, unfortunately, been all too slowly embraced in many respects. However, we are where we are. I accept that the link between ownership and content is very strong. The most appropriate way to proceed is to look at each proposed merger on a case by case basis to see what impact it would have on the criteria laid down in section 23.</P>
      <P>For all of those reasons I do not believe this amendment could or would achieve what Deputies Rabbitte and Higgins set out to achieve.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking about the <i>Irish Examiner </i>and the <i>Evening Echo </i>but it would be more relevant for the future to talk about the convergence of technologies that is going to provide a new medium which will, more and more, be the <Col N="748" /> reality. The Tánaiste recently approved the Eircom acquisition and issued a public statement saying that Dr. O'Reilly had given certain undertakings. He was not required to but he did.</P>

      <P>I still do not know what the undertakings are. They were given behind closed doors and, to my knowledge, have not been published. I do not know if they are worth anything. That is the track record and it seems to me that this is more relevant than the question of whether the <i>Evening Echo</i> has a regional or national market.</P>
      <P>If the Tánaiste finds the Competition Authority so praiseworthy and reposes so much confidence in it and if it is now, however belatedly, adequately staffed, why not let the authority tussle with the definition of market, the issue which divides the House? The Tánaiste appears to say that she agrees with Deputies Higgins, Perry and myself, if only she could define the market. I refuse to accept that one cannot define the market. I think it is possible to define it.</P>
      <P>We all live in the real world of politics. I know this is a big issue in Irish society. I have been subjected to representations on it. One is entitled to make and receive representations in our society and I am not complaining about that. This is a big decision. The Tánaiste is being carefully watched and her decision is a disappointment. We will not get a second bite of this cherry in the near future. A significant lessening of competition will facilitate further aggregation and when we return to this issue in the future it will be too late to address the issue of cross-ownership.</P>
      <P>I am not persuaded by the Tánaiste's arguments. I believe it is possible to define a market. It would be possible to give the authority the task of advising the Minister, leaving the Minister the residual power to act when and if she thinks it appropriate to do so.</P>

      <P>In page 25, to delete lines 38 to 40 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;broadcasting service' means a service which comprises a compilation of programme material of any description and which is transmitted or relayed by means of wireless telegraphy, a cable system or a multipoint microwave distribution system, a satellite device or any other transmission system, directly or indirectly for reception by the general public, whether that material is actually received or not, and includes a sound broadcasting service within the meaning of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, but does not include any such service (whether involving audio-visual material or <Col N="749" /> audio material) that is provided by means of the system commonly known a the Internet;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In response to concerns expressed on Committee Stage in the Seanad and the Dáil as to the coverage of all forms of media under the Bill, I undertook to reconsider the definition in the Bill. In particular it was represented to me that technology such as digital subscriber lines was not covered by the definition. My intention always was to cover all media sectors. I am not concerned with the technology so much as the content.</P>
    <P>I have reconsidered the definition in subsection (12), taken out the reference to licensing and added:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or any other transmission system, directly or indirectly for reception by the general public, whether that material is actually received or not, and includes a sound broadcasting service within the meaning of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, but does not include any such service (whether involving audio-visual material or audio material) that is provided by means of the system commonly known a the Internet&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (13) has been deleted completely. The omission of any references to statutes under which transmission or retransmission is licensed means that the definition in the Bill is not dependent on changes in other legislation.</P>
    <P>The amendment means there is a consequent amendment to the definition of broadcasting service. This definition was taken from the Broadcasting Act, 2001. The definition is now fully quoted in the section, with the addition of the phrase, &ldquo;or any other transmission system&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The amendment defines a broadcasting service as &ldquo;a compilation of programme material&rdquo;. I do not understand this use of the word, &ldquo;compilation&rdquo;. Are we speaking about direct broadcasting or something that has been edited?</P>
      <P>The amendment refers to material which has been transmitted &ldquo;for reception by the general public&rdquo;. What is the necessity for the word &ldquo;general&rdquo;? The phrase, &ldquo;for reception by the public&rdquo; arises in other legislation which relates to broadcasting, and with which I am familiar, where it has a very different meaning.</P>
      <P>The most significant innovation in the amendment is the exclusion of the Internet. Does this have the effect of putting Internet broadcasters into a special category, excluded by the Bill as amended by the Minister's latest amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 substitutes the words &ldquo;of programme material by means of wireless telegraphy, a cable system or a multipoint microwave distribution system, a satellite device or any <Col N="750" /> other transmission system&rdquo;. This amendment omits the reference to the Internet.</P>
    <P>Are we talking about the technical act of broadcasting or programme making? The use of the words &ldquo;general public&rdquo; might allow a person to present a defence by saying a broadcast programme was not directed in general but for specific needs.

We are not talking about the Internet as a means of communication but about the use of the Internet as a broadcaster. We are talking about, for example, the retransmission of audio visual material. This raises immense questions and I afraid I am not defeated by the fact it is the definition in the Broadcasting Act, 2001. I made the same arguments then. The issue is that it does &ldquo;not include any such service (whether involving audio-visual material or audio material) provided by means of the system commonly known as the Internet&rdquo;. No one is talking about the control of the act of communication that it is. It is about whether one envisages the Internet as a broadcaster. The other point I mentioned was about reception by the general public. That definition in the Broadcasting Act had a function because that Act accepted the obligation to broadcast to the public.

I accepted on reflection that it was particularly broad, so I have confined it to any professional association or consumer group or association. It is important, in the context of the powers we are conferring on the competition authority in relation to mergers, that there would be a right of appeal. In the legislation, as drafted, no rights of appeal have been conferred on competitors, consumers or on anybody other than the parties directly involved. I think that is a difficulty, particularly in areas where, for example, the authority from time to time might rubber-stamp a merger without having given it appropriate and sufficiently careful consideration. If either of the parties directly involved do not go to the High Court, nobody can.

      <P>Section 24 should be seen in the wider context of the transfer of the merger responsibilities to the authority which is one of the main new features of the Bill. Had we not provided for the appeal in section 24, there would have been legitimate grounds for concern by enterprises in relation to the transfer of the merger responsibility to the authority. The purpose of the appeal provision in section 24 is to ensure that firms which are aggrieved by negative decisions of the authority in merger cases can have recourse to the courts. The section is constructed on that basis. Negative decisions are unlikely to be the source of grievances or complaints by persons other than the undertakings directly involved. The views of interested third parties, such as trade associations or associations of consumers, can be received and considered by the au thority when it is examining the merger in the first instance. This is sufficient provision and protection for the interests concerned.</P>

If one reads that in conjunction with subsection (7), does it mean that the Minister of the day may not bother to ask the authority?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment of the Dáil. The Crumlin educational support project was founded in 1995 to provide support for children who were not succeeding within the education system. The two schools involved are the Marist national school and Scoil Íosagáin. Children were selected for the project on a teacher and parent recommendation on the basis of the failure of the child to succeed within the classroom environment. The intervention involves social skills training, language development, decision-making training and work with artistic materials to develop students' skills. The project has been a resounding success. This is the view of the teachers, the parents and most importantly of the children themselves. Today, I met two nine year olds who are participating in the programme and they described it as &ldquo;deadly&rdquo;. When one is nine years old, that means only one thing. This is the highest praise one could get for any programme from this cohort. The Minister can see how important this project is to everyone involved in it.</P>
      <P>On 23 July 2001, a delegation from the two schools met with the Minister to seek funding for the continued employment of a child care worker who works with a support teacher in the shared school project. They received a verbal commitment from him at that meeting that the Department of Education and Science would fund half of the cost of the child care worker on an ongoing basis. Written confirmation of that agreement was to follow. It is now eight months later and the Department of Education and Science has not yet confirmed that the money will be provided. A number of pieces of correspondence have been exchanged seeking a simple answer to the question: when will the funding become available? Unless the project receives immediate funding, there is no money to pay the child care worker's salary. At present there are 43 pupils on the project. Without the child care worker, the project can cater for only 15 pupils. This means that 28 pupils will have to be removed from the project. Which 28 would the Minister like to see removed? Will the Minister inform the parents, teachers, child care worker and the 28 pupils that are losing out?</P>
      <P>It is nothing short of a disgrace that the school has not received confirmation of the promised funding before now. There is enough money to fund the project for only two more weeks. A child care worker will lose her job and vulnerable children will be put at risk. The amount of money that was promised was of the order of &euro;12,800 per annum. There is now a crisis in the schools. The schools already have disadvantaged status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Clancy report on participation levels in Ireland's third level colleges was published yesterday. It included Dublin 12 where these schools are located. The participation in third level education from this area was less than half the national average. Against this background, surely <Col N="754" /> it is time to review the distribution of resource in our education system. What do these schools need to do in order to ensure that their pupils get an even break? Will the Minister give an assurance that the child care worker can be retained, that the money will be made available and that the children will not be put at risk by his failure to commit the funding that he promised for this project?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the issue of the resources available to Scoil Íosagáin and the Marist primary school under the Department of Education and Science schemes to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. The Minister for Education and Science is aware of the circumstances of the schools referred to by the Deputy. The schools are already benefiting under a number of schemes aimed at addressing educational disadvantage. However, there is no scheme providing child care workers in schools generally. Accordingly it is not possible to give any commitment in that regard. The Deputy is aware of the major new disadvantage programme, &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;, which the Minister launched in January 2001, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some &euro;33 million with the allocation of over 200 teaching posts.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on behalf of the Department. Schools participating in the programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the schools referred to by the Deputy, may retain their entitlements under that scheme while receiving additional funding. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, Scoil Íosagáin and the Marist primary school are each benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher. They also have a home-school community liaison co-ordinator on a shared basis.</P>
      <P>The schools referred to have been included in the support teacher project since 1999. They share the services of a support teacher who works with pupils with disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviour. The Marist primary school is also included in the early start pre-school programme and has the services of two early start teachers and two child care workers. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the schools also qualify for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" />There are separate urban and rural dimensions to &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;. The schools have been included in the urban dimension and are eligible to receive supplementary capitation funding in respect of the current school year towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. Scoil Íosagáin is eligible to receive &euro;1,658 and Marist primary school is eligible to receive &euro;4,039. This funding is in addition to grants of &euro;3,885 allocated to Scoil Íosagáin and &euro;10,323 allocated to Marist primary school under the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>Schools categorised as urban under &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils, including the schools in question, are being supported where necessary through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class. In senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes &ndash; the pupil teacher ratio has been reduced from 29:1 in the current school year to 27:1 for the 2002-03 school year. On the basis of the approach outlined and taking into account enrolments in the school, Scoil Íosagáin does not require the allocation of any additional teaching posts under the programme. On the same basis, Marist primary school currently has one teaching post under the programme and will be allocated a further post for the 2002-03 school year.</P>
    <P>In late 2001, the schools applied for funding for their project under the fund for the development of targeted educational supports for certain children at risk which is responsibility of Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. However their application was refused in December 2001. The Minister for Education and Science has instructed a senior official of his Department to make contact with the person concerned to resolve the outstanding issue of funding for the joint educational support project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter which refers primarily to County Kerry, I realise from discussions with my colleagues that it applies throughout the country. There is a dearth of services particularly in relation to the assessment of children, speech therapy, psychology services, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Parents in County Kerry asked me to give voice to their concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, we could defend circumstances because we had limited funding available for services and had to do the best we could, but recent successful years in the economy, when we had the best growth rates in the world, make it difficult to explain to people that we appear to be incapable of providing services to those with special needs. The situation is dire and I do not think that the people responsible for providing services understand the difficulties. When I raised this matter in the Dáil some weeks ago, I was told by the Minister for Health and Children, and <Col N="756" /> subsequently by the Southern Health Board, that, for example, we had six whole-time equivalent occupational therapist posts in Kerry community services, but only two of the posts are filled. There were two further therapists employed in 2001, but one returned to Australia and the other was promoted elsewhere. That is not satisfactory for the parents living with children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The statutory authorities seem to be incapable of responding to those needs. I do not think they appreciate the families' difficulties. This is particularly poignant at a time when we are preparing for the Special Olympics &ndash; we are all proud of the effort going into them. People who come to the country for those games will not see the shortage and the lack of services for our own people with special needs.</P>
    <P>I wish that the Minister of State could give some hope and optimism to people throughout the country, not just in Kerry, whether they be carers or the parents of children who need special services. The Minister for Education and Science came into this House many months ago to say that he had an open cheque book to provide services for people with special needs. I tried many times to prise some money from that open cheque book for children with autism in County Kerry. Ten children with autism attend Nano Nagle special school in Listowel and they have no facilities of their own such as a specific classroom. In reply to my parliamentary question, the Minister inanely tells me that we are now spending X pounds more in 2002 than we spent in 1997. It is fantastic that we are spending more but we are not providing the services, which is the key issue. We are spending double on the health services but we are not providing the services there either. It is not the amount we spend but how effective the spending is that matters.</P>
    <P>I do not expect results from the Minister of State at this hour of the night or from the Government this side of an election. It took it five years to discover the necessity of having a health strategy, and now the Government has outlined what it might do in the future, when it should have re-established the health services over the five years of the booming economy. There are enormous pressures on the parents of these children and I hope that the Minister and his officials will get the priorities right. We talk about spending billions on sports facilities at a time when families face these pressures every day. Small amounts of money correctly spent through the health boards, the Brothers of Charity and the special schools would build up the services. That must be the prime responsibility whatever Government is formed after the general election. It behoves all of us as politicians to reach out to these people who are asking for modest financial support to have personnel in place so that children with special needs can get the same entitlement as other children by virtue of our Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Spring for raising this matter and giving me, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health <Col N="757" /> and Children, the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue. Specific funding has been targeted to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Between 1998 and 2000, &euro;6.35 million in additional funding was provided to expand the level of health related support services available to children with autism and their families. A further &euro;4.44 million was allocated in 2001 for these services for both children with autism and those with an intellectual disability. Additional funding amounting to &euro;3.809 million is also being made available for these services in 2002. This will include assessment and diagnostic services, early intervention, pre-school and out reach support for school children. These services are provided by multi-disciplinary teams which include speech and language and occupational therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nursing, project workers and other support staff.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy and psychology to children with special needs in County Kerry is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board. Between 1999 and 2000, additional revenue funding amounting to &euro;724,000 was allocated to the Southern Health Board for the enhancement of health related support services for children with autism. A further &euro;317,000 was made available in 2001, with another &euro;10,317 million coming on stream in 2002 for health related support services for both children with autism and those with an intellectual disability. In addition to this ring fenced funding, children with disabilities will also have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with a physical or sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>The filling of posts which provide speech and language therapy and a clinical psychological service to school age children is a priority for the Southern Health Board. There are five specific posts for speech and language therapists in the intellectual disability agencies in County Kerry, three of which are currently vacant, as has been outlined by Deputy Spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will get a chance to return to this issue at the end.</P>
      <P>There are also six psychologists posts for the county, of which three are still vacant, despite numerous advertising campaigns, both nationally and internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the board that 28.5 posts have to date been allocated to the health related support services for children with autism from the specific funding allocated for this purpose. A considerable proportion of these resources have been allocated to establish a <Col N="758" /> regional assessment team, which is managed by the Brothers of Charity on behalf of the region. Funding for two speech and language therapists posts and a psychologist has been allocated to date specifically for the services in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>While significant additional resources have been made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with disabilities, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services. In acknowledgment of these difficulties, my Department asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. It is a matter, however, for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the service in their region might undertake to facilitate this access.</P>
    <P>In response to the concern of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, over the current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, the Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists. The study, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of each of the therapy grades, requiring a significant increase in training places.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, is working with the Minister for Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority to increase the numbers in training for these professions in line with the needs identified in the report. In addition, I understand a concerted overseas recruitment campaign will be initiated shortly by the Northern Area Health Board on behalf of the health boards to supply professional therapists, including speech and language therapists. These measures, together with continued investment in the services, will greatly assist in delivering an enhanced level of support in these areas to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism and their families.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to the continued development of services for children with disabilities, including the health related support services provided to children in special schools and other educational settings and to working with the Southern Health Board to bring about an enhanced level of support for those availing of their services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this matter which concerns the scheme of community support for older people. I tabled a question to the Minister last week, to which he replied, but my query tonight relates specifically to emergency lighting units in an area of north Mayo comprised of the following community alert areas: Bangor Erris, Ballycroy, Belmullet, Kilcommon, Kilmore Erris, Bellacorrick, Barnatra, Glencastle, Doohoma, Geesala, Belderrig, Inver, Pullathomas and Binghamstown.</P>
      <P>In each of these areas, the community alert operators have received money under the scheme of community support for older people for small grants for items such as small-scale physical security equipment, window locks, door chains, door locks, security lighting and some socially monitored alarm systems such as the panic button pendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made clearly to me that in this area, which has been independently assessed as suffering from severe voltage collapse, or power cuts, because of the inadequacy of the overhead line and because of weather conditions <Col N="760" /> in recent years, small emergency lighting units attached to the main light in a kitchen or wherever should be provided. They could operate for three to four hours and would be of great assistance to elderly people in darkness. There is not much point in having a sensory security light outside one's house if it does not work in the case of a power cut, and there have been frequent power cuts in recent years in the entire north Mayo area covering those areas.</P>
    <P>In his reply, the Minister said that his Department's scheme is specifically designed to provide funding to improve the security and social support of older people. Is it not a fact that an emergency lighting unit in an elderly person's house could be deemed to be social support? Under this community scheme, approximately &euro;1 million is being returned to the Minister's Department, yet the cost of what I propose, as estimated by the people involved in community alert areas in respect of those whom they have identified as being eligible for this, is approximately &euro;50,000, which is loose change.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, has responsibility for older people and I ask him to examine the question of social support in the coming weeks and to allow for a small expansion of the scheme to include emergency lighting units as a social support. The community alert people, who are conscious of elderly people living on their own in isolated areas and do not want them lighting matches if there is a power failure, want them to be eligible for this funding. The ESB wrote to me as a result of my raising the issue and indicated that it intends to carry out major works in this area in the coming years, but that could take a long time.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to re-examine the question of social support and consider expanding the scheme, as he can do under his remit as Minister of State with responsibility for this area, to include emergency lighting units for an identified small number of people in these localities at the minimal cost of approximately &euro;50,000.</P>

As a representative of the north Mayo area and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am happy to reply to this debate on behalf of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who cannot be present this evening.</P>
      <P>Since 1996, the Department has operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Vulnerability is defined in terms of advanced age, disability, isolation and those who have been the victims of crime. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations which have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance. Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated by the Department to the scheme which, to the end of 2001, has assisted some 89,136 individuals.</P>

    <P>To ensure the scheme continues to address the <Col N="761" /> security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society, a sum of &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in the Department's Estimates for 2002. In general, grants under the scheme cover 50% of the once-off cost of the purchase and installation of the necessary security equipment but grants up to 90% may be made available where circumstances so warrant. Funding is provided for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door locks, door chains, security lighting and the once-off cost of installing socially monitored alarm systems such as the pendant alarm system, which is operated via telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist. Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder or burglar alarms.</P>
    <P>To qualify for assistance under the scheme, people aged 65 or older must be living alone or in households made up exclusively of older people or older people who are dependent and vulnerable and unable to install or purchase equipment covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>A fundamental review of the scheme was carried out in 1999 to ensure it was achieving its aims. The review concluded that a large number of people who applied have received genuine benefits in the three years of operation, and that the scheme met real security and social support needs. There were no recommendations for further expansion of the type of security measures and devices already covered by the scheme. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is committed to allocating the available funds to the most vulnerable older people. However, the provision of emergency lighting units to cover power failures is not provided under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of funding emergency lighting units for areas which experience above average power failure and overall policy for the energy sector is a matter for the Department of Public Enterprise. As the Deputy has previously been advised in a written reply, details of his concerns have been forwarded by officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to the Department of Public Enterprise to which any further representations related to this issue should be directed.</P>
    <P>I fully empathise with the Deputy in regard to the situation in north Mayo, and I will follow up on some of the suggestions he made in regard to both Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Birr, Clara and Edenderry provided three excellent swimming pools many years ago. The cost of building them was met by the people of those towns. The major portion of the money collected to build them was raised by the hard work of voluntary committees made up of <Col N="762" /> members of the respective communities, in most cases, parents who wanted to provide facilities for themselves and their children. The money was raised by selling lotto tickets, sponsored walks, church gate collections, cake sales and a variety of other activities. The people of Birr, Clara and Edenderry have welcomed those facilities.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, gave a commitment more than three years ago that the provision of swimming pools for inland counties was a priority, but sadly failure to honour that commitment has resulted in frustration for the people involved in trying to develop the pools in Birr, Clara and Edenderry.</P>
    <P>In regard to Tullamore swimming pool, the development of which is also of the utmost importance, the Minster of State is no doubt aware that the Minister has refused to meet representatives of the Tullamore swimming pool project committee. He was contacted about a meeting six months ago but has still not agreed a date for one. It concerns me that he refuses to have such a meeting? Regrettably, on each occasion Offaly County Council and Tullamore Town Council requested him to proceed with these projects they were met with stonewalling, further requests for information and at this stage they are frustrated about the matter. I call on the Minister of State to give a commitment that the Minister will proceed with the development of each of these pools. That is an absolute priority.</P>
    <P>If one is well off, one can swim in the excellent facilities provided in a number of hotels and clubs in these towns, but the cost of joining those clubs is way in excess of what most young people can afford. Swimming facilities are available, but many people cannot afford to use them.</P>
    <P>Initially the Bertie bowl project was to cost £350 million, but it now seems it will cost in excess of £1 billion. The aquatic centre, in respect of which so much has happened, including the resignation of its former chairman, Mr. Paddy Teahon, was to have cost about £35 million, but it now seems it will cost in excess of £60 million. The people of Offaly are seeking much less funding than that being provided for those two projects. They need those facilities because Offaly is an inland county. Such funding should be provided and it is worrying it has not been. It is my duty to speak on behalf of the people who provided the existing facilities in Clara, Birr and Edenderry. The people in Tullamore have collected &euro;317,000 to date and a further &euro;580,000 has been promised by Tullamore Town Council to develop these pools.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment to the development of these facilities. This is something that I and other members of my party will raise in the run-up to the general election because we believe it is essential that those facilities should be provided. If the Minister of State were to say the Government would give a commitment to these projects, everybody in those areas would be happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Enright for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to <Col N="763" /> outline the current position in relation to swimming pools in the Offaly area.</P>
      <P>The aim of the swimming pool programme is to assist local authorities in the development of swimming pools. However, the type of public swimming pools that were provided and accepted in the 1970s and 1980s are no longer acceptable. This is evident by the improvement in the quality of the facilities now being provided &ndash; a higher standard that has quickly become the minimum standard for the future.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following an initial submission and approval of a feasibility study. In order of progress, they are preliminary report stage, contract document stage, tender stage and construction stage. The Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from the Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>Proposals have been received from Offaly County Council and Tullamore Town Council for the development of swimming facilities in Birr, Clara, Edenderry and Tullamore. The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has asked the council &ndash; with reference to the financial commitment which would be required from Offaly County Council in the event that all these projects were to proceed simultaneously &ndash; to prioritise and, if necessary, review these applications in relation to the demand for local public swimming pools in the Offaly area. On receipt of a response form the county council, the Minister's Department will certainly give further consideration to these proposals.</P>
      <P>The Government has, to use the well known phrase, &ldquo;put its money where its mouth is&rdquo; in support of sport. Our commitment to the development of sport and, in particular to the provision of sporting and recreational facilities, has been demonstrated in very practical terms in all parts of the country. My colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has secured significant increases in the funding for capital expenditure for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These increased provisions include a fourfold increase from &euro;3.8 million in 1999 to a total of &euro;57 million in the annual provision for the swimming pool programme for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002; an increase of almost 700%, from &euro;7.6 million in 1998 to &euro;56 million, for the funding for the sports capital programme in 2001; and &euro;7.55 million towards the development of Ireland's first <Col N="764" /> ever 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick, which is due to open in the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. The Minister is anxious that the substantial investment of taxpayers' money by this Government provides value for money by ensuring that attractive, viable facilities are built. The increased levels of grant-aid now available will be a major boost to local authorities in the development of swimming pools.</P>
      <P>Swimming is a sport in which most people can participate from a very early age and continue throughout their entire lives. Swimming is a most basic, natural and efficient way of taking exercise. The national survey of involvement in sport and physical activity showed that swimming was second only to walking as the most popular form of physical and recreational activity. Although this survey may be somewhat dated, I am not aware of anything that would indicate this trend has changed. It is estimated that around 425,000 people participate in swimming throughout the country. Among leisure and recreational activities, it is generally considered to be one of the best forms of physical exercise for developing and maintaining high levels of physical fitness.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the promotion of sport and the development of facilities such as swimming pools is carried out in a strategic and focused way, which means establishing priorities, avoiding overlaps and ensuring full access to available facilities. Under the swimming pool programme, the development of pools for the future will be done in a structured and focused way, concentrating on areas of greatest need.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Enright for raising this issue and assure him that the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and the Government will remain vigilant in providing funding for modern swimming pool facilities around the country. I reassure the Deputy that the Minister has not forgotten the needs of Offaly.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to be able to launch a very important public consultation document, Towards Better Regulation, on 27 February last. It marked the start of a public consultation process which will help us to frame the first ever Irish national policy statement on better regulation. Because of its importance and relevance to the work of the Oireachtas, I arranged to have copies presented formally to the House and individually sent to all Members.</P>
      <P>This consultation document is intended to be the basis of an important debate on the economic and social aspects of the regulatory process. It begins the process of framing a national policy on regulation and regulatory management. The consultation document sets out the hard questions we need to address in considering why we regulate, what we need to regulate and new approaches to governance in a global economy.</P>
      <P>The consultation document raises a broad range of questions in three general areas, each of which are influenced by the quality of our regulation. These are: the performance of the economy and better consumer welfare; the quality of our governance systems; and the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service.</P>
      <P>Good regulation and good government go hand in hand. Regulatory reform has been a key element of modernising our public service since Delivering Better Government was published in 1996. However, not only is the quality of our regulation important to our public service, it is also critical if we are to sustain the economic and social progress of the last five years. Sustained and increased competitiveness through better regulation can secure and create jobs and generate more resources for social inclusion. This is consistent with the growing recognition in Ireland and internationally that regulation has a big influence on competitiveness. Excessive regulation creates undue and costly burdens on enterprises, puts up barriers to market entry and exit and inhibits innovation. Our own National Competitiveness Council has publicly called for a national policy statement on regulation and this is what we will now deliver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation being undertaken is consistent with this Government's efforts to ensure that, as far as possible, a wide range of views are heard on important issues of public policy. This has been our approach &ndash; whether through the social <Col N="766" /> partnership framework or through stand-alone consultation exercises that have been undertaken by my ministerial colleagues on specific policy issues. My Department's document and the consultation process which has commenced, continues that approach.</P>
    <P>A three month consultation period has been allowed for and the deadline for receipt of submissions is the end of May 2002. Submissions from all quarters are welcome and are being actively encouraged. The document has been widely publicised. Advertisements were placed in the national daily newspapers in February and the possibility of re-advertising the process in April is being held open. It is available on my Department's website and links to it have been placed on the websites of other Departments and agencies. It has also been widely distributed among the social partners, to professional bodies, business organisations and the community and voluntary sector. Copies have also been made available to public libraries and third level colleges.</P>
    <P>What we want at the end of this exercise are the policies to guide the design and implementation of better regulations. It is important to emphasise that this process is not about resolving every micro-level regulatory issue or specific market problem. It is about giving us a set of core principles around: what is regulated in the economy and in society; why certain economic and social activities are regulated; what alternatives should be considered and in what circumstances; and when regulations are the preferred option, how best to enact and enforce them.</P>
    <P>I see these principles being set down in an overarching national policy statement, perhaps as a Government White Paper. Getting our regulatory environment right is crucial if we are to ensure that our policies deliver on the important issues such as fostering employment and innovation, developing our communities, ensuring law and order and advancing national prosperity and competitiveness.</P>

The council continues to be at the forefront in identifying and analysing strategic policy issues and, in that context, undertakes high quality analytical research. The council's work programme for the remainder of the year includes the following projects: the management of public expenditure; regional development in Ireland: A Case Study of the North-West; review of strategic options in tax and social welfare; and Strategy 2002, which will set <Col N="767" /> the context for the negotiations later this year on a successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seventh Progress Report on Parliament, which has only recently been published has been circulated to all Departments for consideration. In so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, in April 1998, I wrote to the all-party committee asking it to examine how people living in Northern Ireland might play a more active part in national political life, to the extent that they so desire and in a spirit consistent with the principles underlying the Good Friday Agreement. I am grateful to the committee which agreed to undertake this review as part of its wider review of the institutions of the State. In undertaking this aspect of its work, the committee had the benefit of submissions received from a number of organisations and individuals, including the SDLP and Sinn Féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" />I deeply appreciate the thoughtful manner in which the committee has approached this sensitive matter. It has sought to ensure that nothing it proposed was at variance with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. Its conclusions are fully consistent with that approach. The committee states its belief that the establishment of a North South joint parliamentary forum, to bring together representatives of the Oireachtas and of the Northern Ireland Assembly, as well as the establishment of an independent consultative forum appointed by the Administrations, representative of civil society, both of which are proposed in the Good Friday Agreement, could make a major contribution to dialogue and mutual understanding between North and South. The Government fully shares this view and would wish to see early progress achieved in these areas.</P>
    <P>I share the committee's view that it could be particularly valuable from time to time to have the expertise, experience and insight of politicians from Northern Ireland in appropriate debates in the Oireachtas. The Government therefore supports making the necessary procedural arrangements to allow MPs elected for Northern Ireland constituencies to speak in periodic debates on Northern Ireland matters and on the operation of the Good Friday Agreement, as envisaged by the committee, and will seek the assistance of other parties in the Dáil to bring this about as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>The committee rightly points to the valuable precedent established by the contributions of past and present Senators from the North in the Seanad. I fully agree that it would be valuable to extend and to formalise this existing practice. The committee brings forward a range of options, some of which would require amendment of the Constitution. These deserve careful consideration and we will seek to move forward on the basis of the maximum political consensus to achieve an outcome that will provide, as soon as practicable, for a permanent presence from Northern Ireland in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The committee also suggests, in the context of an enlarged role in the scrutiny of EU business envisaged for the Seanad, that consideration could be given to allowing MEPs elected in the State and Northern Ireland to speak in periodic debates on EU matters. The Government support the taking of the necessary procedural steps that would facilitate such an initiative. I issued a statement to this effect regarding Northern Ireland following the publication of the all-party report last week.</P>

      <P>I confirm that an abridged version of the Messiah XXI accounts for the period 19 February 1999, to 30 September 2000, have been available in the Oireachtas Library since July of last year. The accounts for the period September 2000 to 2001 have not yet been received. Once received, an abridged version will again be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>As I stated in an earlier reply, the purpose of the award was to ensure that the production took place and importantly that RTE would broadcast the event. It was the committee's unanimous view that the project was entirely suitable for inclusion in the millennium programme. It had a strong Christian theme, historical associations with our capital city and would be broadcast on national television. As with all millennium awards the funding was a once-off grant not a loan. Accordingly, the millennium committee was not looking for a financial return. With such an ambitious project the likelihood of it subsequently making large profits was regarded by the committee as very unlikely.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that Messiah XXI itself offered to donate a portion of its net after tax profits to Irish charities and the committee ensured that this was pledged in a formal manner. However, as can be seen from the current set of accounts placed in the Oireachtas Library they are carrying a loss. The final position will not be clear for some time. This will depend on whatever commercial success Messiah XXI productions has in selling the broadcasting rights, videos etc. I wish the company every success in their endeavours. In the meantime, I have asked the millennium office to continue to monitor the position.</P>

      <P>The reference date for census 2002 is Sunday 28 April. Recruitment of the temporary field staff who will conduct the enumeration is now at an advanced stage. The supervisory field force grades, consisting of five census liaison officers, 35 regional supervisors and 350 field supervisors, are already in place and fully trained. Successful candidates for the 4,000 enumerator positions are being contacted with a view to commencing the field operation on 27 March, following appropriate training. A public awareness campaign, incorporating television, radio, press and outdoor media, will begin on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of the field operation, which will run until census day, will involve the enumerators making contact with householders throughout the country and delivering blank census forms to them for completion on census day. The second phase of the field operation will start on <Col N="770" /> Monday, 29 April and will involve the collection of completed census forms. This is planned to conclude by the end of May at which time all materials will be returned to the Central Statistics Office for processing. Preliminary results, which will be based on summary counts prepared by the enumerators, will be published before the end of July at the level of electoral division. The first set of final results should be available in the first half of 2003.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" />The response of the international community to the events of 11 September has been impressive. The United Nations has played a central role. On 12 September the Security Council adopted Resolution 1368, which reaffirmed the right to self-defence and called on all states to work together to prevent and suppress international terrorism and to bring to justice the perpetrators of the attacks. On 28 September, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1373, calling on all states to take legislative and financial measures to combat terrorism, including ratification of the 12 existing anti-terrorist conventions, in particular the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. This convention will enter into force on 10 April 2002 having been ratified by 22 countries. Ireland signed the convention on 15 October 2001, and legislation to permit ratification is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), established by the Security Council to monitor the implementation of Resolution 1373, requested all member states to submit reports. To date, 142 reports, including the Irish report, on national implementation of the resolution have been received and are being evaluated by members of the CTC including Ireland. Member states will be asked, as necessary, to follow up with supplementary reports on particular questions raised by the committee. Where required, assistance will be provided to those member states who need to upgrade their capacity for legislative, executive, or judicial action against terrorism.</P>
    <P>Under Resolution 1373, the following regional organisations, among others, are playing a key role in the fight against terrorism: the European Union, EU, the Organisation on Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, OIC, the Arab League, the Organisation of American States, OAS, the Rio Group, the Southern African Development Community, SADC, and the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN. The EU, for its part, drew up an action plan, approved by the European Council on 21 September, under the following headings &ndash; enhancing police and judicial co-operation, developing international legal instruments, putting an end to the funding of terrorism, and strengthening air security. A wide range of specific measures, both internal and external, are being implemented by the relevant EU councils, including General Affairs, Justice and Home Affairs, ECOFIN and Transport.</P>
    <P>In addition to co-operation with the United States under these headings, the Government, acting on foot of Security Council Resolution 1368, and in accordance with the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, opened Irish airspace and airports to US aircraft involved in action aimed at bringing to justice those involved in the terrorist attacks of 11 September. Since 11 September, the following factors are <Col N="772" /> clear. Long-term security, peace and prosperity can never again be taken for granted. The continuing threat from international terrorism can only be met by concerted international co-operation. Both morally and materially, international terrorism calls for a globalised response. This response must not only tackle the manifestations of terrorist activity but also deal with the root causes of conflict.</P>
    <P>Ideological, ethnic or religious fanaticism sometimes, of course, requires no motivation beyond itself. The only answer to that kind of terrorism is an adequate security response in the short and medium term, together with the long-term effort of attempting to spread the values of tolerance and mutual respect. The international community needs to develop an integrated approach to conflict prevention and conflict resolution, making imaginative and systematic use of the full range of instruments at our disposal. These include a judicious and flexible application of classical diplomacy, together with an enhanced focus on human rights, economic development, institution building, good government, targeted sanctions, police and judicial co-operation, peacekeeping, and, as a last resort, peace making. The new spirit of international co-operation against terrorism will remain necessary for a long time to come.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 39, 40, 45, 59, 64, 70, 79, 88 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>This House heard statements on the Barcelona European Council on Wednesday 20 March, during which we reported on the foreign policy issues discussed in Barcelona, namely the situations in the Middle East, in Serbia and Montenegro, in the Federal Republic of Macedonia, in Zimbabwe, in Angola, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, and a human rights case in Nigeria. Conclusions were adopted on all of these topics by the European Council and a copy of the Barcelona Conclusions was placed in the Oireachtas Library in the usual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Middle East was very much our main focus of concern on this occasion. The European Union adopted a declaration which sets out clearly the Union's expectations of both parties, outlines the steps which the Union considers are necessary to achieve peace and expresses the support of the Union for certain recent initiatives, such as Security Council Resolution 1397, the ideas of Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and the renewed engagement of the special envoy of the US President, General Zinni. The declaration also restates the willingness of the European Union to work with General Zinni and the other members of the so called &ldquo;quartet&rdquo;&ndash; that is, the Russian Federation and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General. As was reiterated at Barcelona, Ireland and our European partners remain convinced that a third party <Col N="774" /> monitoring mechanism would help both parties to pursue peace. The exact form which a monitoring group might take would be for later decision. We would look favourably on any form of monitoring which was acceptable to both parties.</P>
    <P>The EU has an important role in the peace process, notably through regular meetings with the main players involved, visits by EU leaders, the Presidency, High Representative Solana and the activities of the EU Special Envoy for the peace process. The EU also facilitates regional dialogue through the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. The EU is the largest donor of non-military aid to the peace process as well as primary donor of financial and technical assistance to the Palestinian Authority, providing more than 50% of the international community's finance for the West Bank and Gaza Strip in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is very little realistic prospect of introducing trade sanctions or similar measures. Furthermore, these could have undesired consequences, such as undercutting any role which the EU might have in the peace process as far as Israel is concerned and blocking Palestinian trade with the EU. There is a range of views among the member states of the European Union on how best to deal with the Middle East conflict, as in many other international issues. However, there is unanimity of view within the European Union on the desired outcome. All of us wish to see the emergence of an independent, viable and democratic Palestinian state which will live beside an Israel which enjoys peace and security within internationally recognised borders. The European Union does have a balanced position which seeks to deal with all the dimensions of this very complex question and to contribute in a practical and realistic way to resolving this dispute.</P>
    <P>Ireland has its own independent point of view, based on our own experiences, which we seek to advance both in the EU and at the UN. Our principled and consistent position is well known and respected by the parties and by other actors as well as our partners in the European Union and on the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>The ideas advanced by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia have been widely welcomed in the Arab world and in the wider international community. The ideas are being considered by Arab leaders at their summit meeting in Beirut today and hope that a consensus will emerge from that meeting which will serve as a basis for negotiations leading to the solution of the Middle East problem. Mr. Javier Solana is in Beirut for the summit as the representative of the European Union.</P>
    <P>We greatly regret that the Israeli authorities have imposed conditions which did not permit President Arafat to attend the summit meeting. We consider that his participation in the summit would have provided a major contribution to the discussions. The fact that he has been unable to do so does not benefit the peace process in any way. It is essential that the Palestinian leader <Col N="775" /> should have full freedom to move both within the Palestinian Territories and internationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>On Sunday 17 March last, three people broke into a special branch office at Castlereagh police complex, assaulted a police officer and took certain documentation. The identities of those responsible are unknown, as are their exact intentions.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the incident, the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, characterised the incident as a &ldquo;breach of national security.&rdquo; He announced the setting up of a review by Sir John Chilcot, former head of the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Colin Smith, a former Chief Constable of Thames Valley Constabulary, will assist Sir John, acting as an assessor. The terms of reference of the review are to establish how unauthorised access was gained to a Special Branch office, the extent of any damage caused to national security, the adequacy of action subsequently taken to mitigate any such damage and to prevent unauthorised access there and in similar buildings elsewhere in Northern Ireland, and wider lessons to be learned. Dr. Reid will make a further statement once the review is concluded. This review will run parallel with the criminal investigation being headed by Detective Chief Superintendent Phil Wright of the PSNI. The Policing Board has a crucial role to play in this matter as the body to which the Police Service of Northern Ireland must account for its actions. It is critical that the issue is managed in a way that not only protects the public but encourages the public to have confidence in policing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have raised our serious concerns about the break-in at Castlereagh police complex with the British Government through the Secretariat of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. These discussions are ongoing as we seek to unravel this perplexing and disturbing event. We do not yet have sufficient facts to say how this break-in was achieved. It will be some time before we have an idea as to why it was done. We cannot prejudge the outcome of the investigations currently taking place, but I can say with certainty that confidence in policing, in the rule of law and in justice requires that we get to the bottom of the break-in, who did it and for what purpose. The truth must be established and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. That is the fundamental requirement to ensure that pub<Col N="776" /> lic concerns arising from this affair are fully and satisfactorily resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Female genital mutilation, FGM, is an abhorrent but widespread practice in communities in parts of Africa, the Middle East and south east Asia. Although it is associated with countries which have a strong Muslim tradition, it is not an exclusively Islamic practice. It occurs also in immigrant communities in North America and Europe. According to WHO, up to 130 million women and girls have undergone genital mutilation worldwide and at least two million girls are at risk of genital mutilation each year. There is no medical indication for the practice and it is frequently carried out by persons with no training. It frequently leads to serious physical and psychological problems for women who have undergone it. In a substantial number of cases it is implicated as a direct cause of serious illness and death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continued practice of FGM is a direct infringement of the universally recognised rights of women and children on whom it is inflicted and is rightly condemned. However, it is a complex phenomenon, deeply rooted in the cultural, social, religious, and gender relationships of the societies in which it occurs. It is just one manifestation of gender based human rights inequalities <Col N="777" /> which are prevalent in many societies and which compromise the physical, psychological and sexual rights of women. It is important to recognise also that efforts to curtail FGM cannot be viewed in isolation to other efforts that address the many forms of civil, political, social and economic injustice that women suffer worldwide.</P>
    <P>The Government, through its commitment to UN declarations and agencies, demonstrates a strong commitment to advancing the social and economic development of women. We are also active in pursuing human rights issues through our membership of the European Union. At last year's session of the UN Human Rights Commission, the EU spoke out on several occasions against the practice of FGM and called for it to be urgently addressed. The EU will be taking up the matter again at this year's session of the commission, which is currently taking place in Geneva. Ireland's commitment to addressing FGM is given further expression through support for specific programmes for the advancement of women in developing countries, financed through Ireland Aid and the European Commission. The World Health Organisation, which receives considerable voluntary contributions from my Department, has a long record of addressing FGM from the perspective of the right of women and girl children to the highest attainable standard of health.</P>
    <P>In June 2000, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, led the Irish delegation to the special session of the UN General Assembly on the five year review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which were adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995. At Beijing + 5, member states adopted by consensus a document, entitled &ldquo;Further Actions and Initiatives,&rdquo; to implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. The document deals in some depth with the issue of FGM and notes that while an increasing number of countries have introduced legislation to ban it, the practice continues to be widespread. The document calls upon governments to develop, adopt and fully implement laws and other measures to eradicate FGM and other violations of the human rights of women. The Government fully subscribes to this approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of child soldiers is an issue of particular concern to the Government. The Government is committed to bringing to an end the use of child soldiers in contravention of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. We urge all governments and armed groups to adhere to the international humanitarian and human rights standards that protect the rights of children in conflict situations.</P>
      <P>We also support the work of the United Nations to protect those children affected by war, particularly the work of the UN Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict. The special representative, Mr. Olaru Otunnu, acts as an advocate for the adoption of measures to protect children and their mothers in areas of armed conflict, to prevent the recruitment of children as armed combatants, and to promote the demobilisation and reintegration of children who have been engaged in armed conflict with particular reference to their mental and physical health and education.</P>
      <P>Ireland is part of an informal group known as the friends of the special representative, which includes 11 other EU member states and the EU Commission as well as Canada, Japan, Malaysia, India and Kenya. The aim of the group of friends is to support the work of the special representative and to promote measures for the protection of children in armed conflict. Ireland has contributed &euro;48,250 to a trust fund set up to support the work of the special representative.</P>
      <P>I welcome the launch of Trócaire's Lenten campaign which highlights the plight of children who are involved in armed conflict and the measures necessary to prevent their recruitment and to promote and protect their rights.</P>
      <P>The Government attaches great importance to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which is central to the protection and promotion of children's rights on a global level and has achieved almost universal ratification.</P>
      <P>During the 57th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which concluded its deliberations in Geneva in April of last year, a European Union resolution on the rights of the child was adopted by consensus. That resolution was fully supported by the Irish delegation. It called on all states to end the use of children as soldiers, to ensure that children are not forcibly recruited into their armed forces, and to take all feasible measures to prevent recruitment and use of children by armed groups. The issue of child soldiers will also be addressed at this year's ongoing Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection and promotion of the rights of all human beings is the first responsibility of every government. The use of child soldiers is a most fundamental abuse of human rights, and presents a challenge to all governments. High<Col N="779" /> lighting and addressing this issue is a priority for the Government.</P>

      <Quest>if progress has been made on the resolution of the perceived inconsistency he acknowledged between Ireland's vote at the United Nations on Cuba and the common resolution adopted by member countries of the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy is correct in recalling that I have previously acknowledged that there is a perception in some quarters of inconsistency between, on the one hand, Irish and EU opposition to the US economic embargo against Cuba, and on the other hand, the EU Common Position on Cuba, I have also pointed out on several occasions that in reality there is no inconsistency between the two positions.</P>
      <P>In replying to questions in this House on 7 February last, I reiterated the Government's clear position regarding the US economic embargo against Cuba. Ireland is opposed to the embargo and we wish to see it brought to an end. Together with our partners in the EU, we have regularly supported the resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for its lifting, most recently on 27 November last when the resolution was carried by 167 votes in favour to three against, with three abstentions. It is to be hoped that attention will be paid to the overwhelming majority voice of the General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the US, the EU operates no sanctions against Cuba. On the contrary, EU member states carry on normal relations with Havana across the full spectrum of contacts from trade to culture. In fact, the 15 member states have <Col N="780" /> actively developed their economic relationship with the island to such an extent that the EU is now Cuba's leading foreign investor, principal trade partner, premier source of tourists, and largest provider of development aid and humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>What the EU cannot do is advance beyond normal relations to the kind of special relationship represented by the structured co-operation agreements which have been negotiated with other countries in the region. These co-operation agreements are partnerships based on the shared values of respect for democracy and human rights.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the authorities in Havana do not share our view of these values at this time. Reports by agencies such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly documented the absence of respect for a number of fundamental human rights.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the EU General Affairs Council conducts a close and careful evaluation of conditions obtaining in Cuba at regular six-monthly intervals. Following the latest assessment, the Council found, on 10 December last, that the situation in Cuba remains &ldquo;seriously wanting as regards the recognition and application of civil and political freedoms and the refusal of the Cuban authorities to contemplate reforms leading to a political system based on those values&rdquo;. The Council, therefore, was on this occasion reluctantly obliged once again to renew the Common Position, pending a change in Cuban policy regarding human rights and freedoms which would enable Havana to accept the standards applied by the EU to all countries, without any discrimination, wishing to have the kind of enhanced relationship with the Union inherent in an institutionalised co-operation agreement.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Council is encouraged by the recent renewal of political dialogue by Havana in December 2001, when the EU troika led by Belgian Foreign Minister Michel, visited Cuba. This renewed dialogue offers some hope that progress can be made in the coming period. The EU side has made it clear that it expects to see meaningful indications from the Cuban Government that it will move to respect international norms in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms including, for example, the principles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
    <P>If Havana were to sign these two covenants and to respect their provisions, the way might begin to open up towards changes in the Common Position which could lead to the negotiation of a fully-fledged, mutually beneficial co-operation agreement.</P>
    <P>Unlike the US, therefore, the EU and its member states not only maintain quite normal and indeed vibrant relations with Cuba in such areas as trade, tourism, culture and humanitarian assistance, but we are also anxious to encourage the <Col N="781" /> kind of progress in the fields of human rights and democratisation which would enable us to develop an even closer relationship of the kind obtaining with other countries in the region.</P>

      <P>I wish to take Questions Nos. 42 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The National Forum on Europe was established by the Government with a mandate to &ldquo;facilitate a broad discussion of issues relevant to Ireland's membership of an enlarging Union and to consider the range of topics arising in the context of the debate on the future of Europe&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since its launch on 18 October last year, the forum has proved very effective in stimulating and providing a platform for a wide-ranging debate on the European Union and on Ireland's place in that Union. It has succeeded in its important goal of providing an inclusive debate. The series of &ldquo;mini-fora&rdquo; held around the country, as I saw clearly for myself, have been particularly successful in helping to bring the debate on Europe closer to our citizens.</P>
      <P>A report by its chairman, Senator Maurice Hayes, on the first phase of work of the forum was published on 25 February. I strongly welcomed the report and notably its conclusion that there is a broad national consensus in favour of enlargement and that there is a strong awareness of the continuing immense practical benefits of EU membership to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Last week, the forum concluded the next phase of its work and I look forward to the report on that phase which, I understand, is expected after the general election.</P>
      <P>Alongside the clear recognition of the benefits which Ireland derives from membership of the European Union and our continued strong commitment to that membership, there are a number of areas of concern to people which the Government is determined to address effectively and comprehensively. The forum has contributed greatly to identifying and teasing out those concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision on the continuation of the forum after the general election will be one for the new Government. This Government established the forum for the reasons I have outlined, strongly supports its work and welcomes the important progress it has made in its important task. In the Government's view the mandate of the forum, to <Col N="782" /> facilitate broad discussion of Ireland's membership of an enlarging Union, will remain relevant over the coming period especially in the context of European Convention on the Future of Europe which was launched on 28 February.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Hayes again on his balanced and open approach and to congratulate participants in the forum more generally for their constructive contributions to a debate which is of fundamental importance to the people of this country.</P>

      <QRef>[10268/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Iraq refuses to comply with Security Council Resolution 1284, adopted in December 1999, which established a new arms inspection body, the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, UNMOVIC. Resolution 1284 provides for the suspension and eventual lifting of sanctions if the Government of Iraq allows arms inspections to be renewed. Resolution 1382, adopted by the Security Council on 29 November 2001, commits the Council to conclude negotiations on reform of sanctions by 1 June 2002 and agreed, if necessary, to examine whether clarifications are needed in respect of Resolution 1284.</P>
      <P>At present, the council is working on refining and agreeing a goods review list and the procedures for the application of that list. This is intended to relax restrictions on Iraq's imports of civilian goods, eliminate holds on contracts for essential infrastructural projects, and to tighten controls on military items. The application of the goods review list will reverse the basis of sanctions from a general prohibition to one based solely on a specific and limited list of prohibited items of possible military application.</P>
      <P>Ireland welcomed Resolution 1382 and we were active in achieving its adoption. In our view, the proposed reform of the sanctions should substantially improve the humanitarian situation in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" />Necessary consumer goods, such as food, medicines and other commodities, will continue to be imported, though Ireland is concerned that the UN humanitarian programme should also focus on the restoration of the basic social and economic infrastructure. In the discussions in the Security Council Ireland has sought progress on other elements necessary to lay the basis for the long-term development needs of Iraq, including a cash component for the oil for food programme, and the lifting of restrictions on service contracts and foreign investment.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to call on Iraq to comply fully with the demands of the Security Council which would make it possible for the suspension and eventual lifting of the sanctions. We have also called on Iraq to co-operate with the UN humanitarian programme. The UN Secretary General has pointed to serious difficulties and obstacles placed by the Government of Iraq in the way of the effective implementation of that programme, resulting in unnecessary hardship to its own people. He has also stated that sufficient funds are available through the programme for Iraq to address the nutritional and health needs of the population, particularly those of children.</P>
    <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the humanitarian situation in Iraq. Ireland, as a member of the Security Council, will remain committed to eliminating the suffering caused to the people of Iraq. This is all the more urgent in the present international context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Since the hunger strike in the Turkish prisons was last raised in the House on 22 November, the number of prisoners or their supporters who have died has risen to 49. The most recent death was that of Mr. Tuncay Yildirim, who died on 21 March in Izmir, following the granting of a six month release on health grounds. His death, like the deaths of all the other hunger strikers, represents a tragic waste of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" />Since the hunger strike began in October 2000, I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions the grave concerns of the Government about the human rights situation in the Turkish prisons. The matter has been raised by the Irish Ambassador to Turkey at the highest level, including with Foreign Minister Cem. We will continue to raise the matter with the Turkish authorities on every appropriate occasion.</P>
    <P>The European Union too has been actively involved in encouraging efforts to bring the hunger strike to an end. The 2001 Regular Report on Turkey's Progress towards Accession, released by the EU Commission on 13 November last, emphasised that the continuing loss of life as a result of the hunger strike was unacceptable from a humanitarian point of view and encouraged Turkey to ensure that prison reforms were fully implemented. The next meeting of the EU Association Council with Turkey on 16 April will provide another opportunity to raise the matter with the Turkish authorities.</P>
    <P>I refer also to the role of the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, which is continuing to work with the Turkish Government and with the prisoners in an attempt to resolve the crisis. In this connection, I welcome the fact that the Turkish Government has given its agreement to the publication of the preliminary observations of a delegation of the committee which visited Turkey from 2-14 September last and that these observations, together with the response of the Turkish authorities, were published on 19 March.</P>
    <P>I note, in particular, that the delegation proposed that immediate steps be taken by the prison authorities in relation to the provision of communal activities in the F-type prisons involved, a key element in the dispute. The delegation also indicated its view that the satisfactory operation of the prisons would depend in large part on the attitude and quality of staff.</P>
    <P>In response, the Turkish Government has stated that the F-type prisons are high-security prisons which were built in accordance with the minimum prison standards of the Council of Europe and of the United Nations. Communal facilities are available but the great majority of prisoners held for terrorist offences refuse to make use of them, despite the efforts of the prison administration. The Turkish Government also states that, for security reasons, the number of prisoners allowed to take part in communal activities at any one time may not always be at the level &ndash; nine persons &ndash; recommended by the CPT delegation. The authorities accept that achieving more satisfactory results in the prisons will depend on the quality of the staff. They note that 200 staff members have completed training in the prison staff training centre in Ankara and have taken up duty in the F-type prisons. In addition, 210 staff members employed in the prisons have started training in the centre.</P>
    <P>A number of legislative measures have been adopted in Turkey in relation to prison reform, <Col N="785" /> including a law on the establishment of monitoring boards for punishment enforcement Institutions and detention houses, which will establish 133 monitoring boards to carry out inspections on conditions in penal institutions. I welcome the adoption of this legislation, but take this occasion once again to urge all the parties involved to exercise restraint and to make every additional effort necessary to ensure that further loss of life, both inside and outside the prisons, can be avoided.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a full and active participant in the formulation and conduct of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP. Ireland was a full and equal participant in the negotiations at successive intergovernmental conferences which agreed the objectives and parameters of CFSP as set out in the treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, which were approved by referendum of the Irish people. The development of the CFSP has been fully consistent with, and provides an important vehicle for, the pursuit of Ireland's foreign and security policy traditions, in particular the priority we attach to the rule of law in international affairs; the importance of the United Nations, where the EU are collectively the largest contributor to the UN budget and programmes; humanitarian and development issues, where again the EU is the world's largest donor of humanitarian and development aid; human rights issues, which are an integral focus in the conduct of the EU's relations with third countries; and conflict prevention and crisis management, which are at the core of the capacities being developed through the European security and defence policy. Ireland's voice in the world is greatly enhanced though our participation in CFSP, and like my predecessors I have accorded it high priority in the conduct of our foreign policy. Ireland's participation in the CFSP is fully consistent with our traditional policy of military neutrality.</P>

      <P>Additionally, Ireland has ratified the ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, in which Article 3 defines &ldquo;the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict&rdquo; as comprising the worst form of child labour.</P>
      <P>Ireland has joined an informal group known as the &ldquo;Friends of the Special Representative&rdquo;, which includes 11 other EU member States and the EU Commission as well as Canada, Japan, Malaysia, India and Kenya. The aim of the group of friends is to support the work of the special representative and to promote measures for the protection of children in armed conflict.</P>
      <P>Ireland has signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. The ratification by Ireland of the optional protocol to the convention is the subject of active and ongoing consideration by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Defence. The main issue requiring attention is the potential implications of the ratification of the optional protocol for recruitment to the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>There have been several meetings with representatives of the families of the Omagh bombing victims. For example, last month, our Ambassador in London met members of the Omagh relatives group. Last year, my colleague the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform met representatives of the families. In January 2000, the Taoiseach met Mr. Victor Barker, the father of one of the victims while an official of my Department also met representatives of the group that month.</P>
      <P>In addition, we have received a request from the Omagh Support and Self-Help Group, which represents most of the families affected by the Omagh bombing, for a meeting to discuss issues of concern. The request is currently being considered and a meeting will be arranged for a mutually convenient date in the near future.</P>
      <P>The atrocity at Omagh was a truly barbaric act of terrorism and I again extend my sincerest sympathies and support to the families and friends of those killed and injured. I reaffirm the determination of the Irish Government, in partnership with the British Government, to bring to justice those responsible for the Omagh bombing. This issue has not gone off the agenda. The Garda Síochána, in full co-operation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, have spared no effort in their continuing investigation, which recently yielded a conviction on conspiracy charges in the Special Criminal Court. However long it takes us, the perpetrators of this evil deed will be pursued and held fully to account before the law.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the initiatives Ireland proposes to take during its membership of the Security Council to curb the enormous global expenditure on armaments, such as regulations to limit their distribution and sanctions for their dissemination without conditions to various areas of conflict; the priorities Ireland has chosen for its membership of the Security Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Security Council has specific responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of international peace and security, it does not have primary responsibility within the UN system for dealing with disarmament issues. As a SECCO member, Ireland has taken every opportunity to try to reduce the proliferation of small arms to areas of conflict, in particular in Africa. We have played an active role in ensuring the effective implementation of UN sanctions in countries such as Angola, Sierra Leone and Liberia which aim to reduce the flow of arms to these conflict areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Elsewhere in the UN system, much of the prac<Col N="788" /> tical work of devising general principles in relation to disarmament takes place in the UN Disarmament and International Security Committee, commonly known as the First Committee, of which Ireland is a member. The First Committee meets during the UNGA session to deal with the disarmament issues on the agenda of that session, and its consultations shape the tone of the disarmament debate. Ireland is an active participant in this committee and will, in 2002, use all useful opportunities to ensure that the pursuit of disarmament and non-proliferation stays at the fore of the committee's deliberations and output.</P>
    <P>With regard to nuclear weapons, which is one of the costliest forms of the arms race, Ireland has a long-standing active commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, whose review cycle resumes in April of this year. Together with our New Agenda partners, Ireland will be active in pursuing the objectives of this treaty.</P>
    <P>In July of 2001 the UN Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects took place in New York. Ireland played a very active role in this conference and worked with European Union partners to achieve the strongest possible outcome. The major issues dealt with by the conference were export criteria and controls, tracing and marking of weapons and regulation of brokers. The programme of action agreed, by consensus, contains politically binding commitments at national, regional and international level. It also establishes a framework for follow-up action including provision for a review conference to be held in 2006.</P>
    <P>Ireland also played a key role in the negotiations for the 1997 Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and continues to advocate the need for all states to accede to the convention in order to ensure a worldwide ban on these weapons. Ireland has made ongoing contributions to humanitarian mine action programmes. Since 1994 Ireland has spent just under &euro;9 million on a wide variety of de-mining and rehabilitation projects as part of its humanitarian assistance projects.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to use its voice and influence where it can be useful in making progress on the issues of arms production and proliferation in all their aspects.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's question about the priorities for our membership of SECCO, our key priorities at the council have been to promote Ireland's broad foreign policy interests, values and objectives and to make a constructive contribution to the work of the council in the maintenance of international peace and security. Ireland is now in our second year as a member of the Security Council and I believe that we have been successful in achieving both of these aims.</P>

The Government also gave a commitment to work for the early establishment of this forum under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF.</P>
      <P>At the second plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, held in Dublin on 26 September 2000, the council agreed that a Joint North-South Working Group, comprising officials of both Administrations, be tasked with studying the establishment of the forum and reporting to the next plenary.</P>
      <P>A report on the work of the Joint North-South Working Group was made to the third plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, which met in Dublin on 30 November 2001.</P>
      <P>The matter was further discussed at the North-South Ministerial Council's first meeting in institutional format, held in Belfast on 17 December 2001, when it was agreed that the forum should be based on a formal interaction between structures representative of civil society in both parts of the island. The working group was charged with consulting with the Northern Ireland Civic Forum and the social partners participating in the central review mechanism of the PPF with a view to bringing forward proposals for consideration at the next plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, scheduled for May.

      <P>Protocol 7 to the European Convention on Human Rights was ratified by Ireland on 3 August 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary responsibility for the ratification of Protocol 12, which extends the anti-discrimination provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, lies with the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform and I understand that this matter is currently under examination in that Department. This protocol has not yet come into force. Ten ratifications are needed for entry <Col N="790" /> into force and Georgia is the only state to have ratified the Protocol to date.</P>
    <P>Ireland has comprehensive anti-discrimination protection in place since the enactment of the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts which prohibit discrimination on nine separate grounds including race, colour, religion, national or social origin, political or other opinion, association with a national minority, sexual orientation, property, birth, or status. This legislation also put in place mechanisms to offer redress for individuals to pursue complaints in regard to discrimination experienced on any of these grounds. Ireland has, therefore, already provided in national law for many of the provisions of Protocol 12.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &ldquo;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude: slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms&rdquo;. Full adherence to the absolute values enshrined in the declaration is of paramount importance. The concept of slavery has broadened from the traditional concept of the slave trade and now includes practices such as bonded labour and child labour.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as bonded labour, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. We voice our concerns wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. While the issue of bonded labour or child labour is not primarily a matter of the UN Security Council, we remain vigilant for opportunities to pursue the issue in the context of ongoing discussions on specific issues.</P>
      <P>I welcome Trócaire's recent Lenten campaign which highlighted the issue of bonded labour and child labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts to eliminate contemporary forms of slavery involve a wide spectrum of international organisations, NGOs and governments. Slavery and human rights issues in general are normally considered by the UN bodies which have a specific role and expertise in this area, notably the Commission on Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation, ILO. Ireland has <Col N="791" /> ratified the ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour, in which Article 3 defines &ldquo;all forms of child slavery or practices similar to slavery&rdquo; as comprising the worst form of child labour.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, led the delegation to the 89th International Labour Conference in Geneva in June 2001. He raised the issue of bonded labour in the course of the discussion at the plenary session of the conference where he put forward a number of practical measures to address this specific problem. The Minister of State's proposals received the strong support of the majority of his EU member state colleagues. Mr. Juan Somavia, the Director-General of the ILO made specific reference to Minister of State's call for special measures to deal with the problems of bonded labour.</P>
    <P>The EU put forward a resolution at the 57th session of the Commission on Human Rights, which called on all states to render concrete their commitments to eliminate child labour in it's worst form, and especially where interferes with the child's education, health or development and, in this regard, to consider ratifying ILO Convention No. 182 on the worst forms of child labour. Ireland is actively calling for the issue of child soldiers to be raised at the current session of the Commission on Human Rights.</P>

    <P>Achievement of the 0.7% target will require further annual increases in funding and it is <Col N="792" /> anticipated that the budget required in 2007 will be almost &euro;1 billion. An increase of this order of magnitude will offer significant opportunities to strengthen our support across all areas of the existing programme as well as allowing scope for possible expansion in new directions and in the geographical spread of the programme.</P>
    <P>Against the backdrop of the expansion of the programme, the Government established a committee of experts to carry out a comprehensive review of the aid programme. The Ireland Aid Review Committee has had to address a wide range of complex issues. As part of its work, it undertook a wide consultation process and analysed submissions from more than 250 groups and individuals. The committee's report, which has been published this morning, is an excellent contribution which will provide a comprehensive blueprint for the future development of the aid programme. It makes a number of recommendations in relation to bilateral programmes with new countries and to the multilateral programme which I commend to the Deputy's attention. The Government accepts these recommendations and steps will now be taken to implement them.</P>

    <P>Mr. Howlin asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will support the call for re-examination of the 1969 Act of Free Choice which confirmed West Papua's incorporation into Indonesia; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [10275/02]</P>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen): As the House is aware from the previous questions to which I have replied, the Government remains concerned about the situation in Papua and the human rights situation in particular. I am very aware of the outstanding questions about the circumstances surrounding the 1969 Act of Free Choice in Irian Jaya, and the role of the UN in that process. On whether the matter should be revisited, I have made clear previously that Ireland was not a party to the 1969 Act, and it is not within this Government's power to re-examine the outcome of the Act.</P>
    <P>On the question of a possible UN review of the events of 1969, this would be a matter for the UN Secretariat and the UN Secretary General. Procedurally, re-opening the issue would require the support of UN member states. Our mission to the UN informs me that at present there appears to be no significant support among UN member states for a review of the 1969 decision. There is no intention on the Secretariat's part to re-open the issue. Furthermore, I would be concerned that such a review may prejudice ongoing efforts to initiate a peaceful and meaningful dialogue with the Government authorities in Jakarta and would not contribute to the amelioration of the current situation of the people.</P>
    <P>Of primary concern to the Government are reports of ongoing human rights abuses in Papua <Col N="793" /> and in particular allegations of military police involvement in such violations. This issue has been taken up at EU level and a team of EU ambassadors has just returned from a visit to Papua last week. There they met leading human rights groups in the region, representatives of the Catholic and Protestant churches, members of the Papuan Preasidium Council and tribal leaders as well as government representatives and military commanders in the region. I look forward to their report, which will be the basis for discussion at EU level. Their report will also be examined in the context of the EU's proposal to develop a political dialogue with the Indonesian government. This dialogue should include human rights as an important area for discussion and in particular the situation in the regions. At UN level, Ireland is currently attending the Fifty-Eighth Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva where the EU plans to highlight its growing concern about the human rights situation in Indonesia.</P>

    <P>Mr. Rabbitte asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs his views on the priority areas for the Convention on the Future of Europe, established at the Laeken Summit. [4162/02]</P>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen): The European Council, at its meeting in Laeken in December 2001, established the European Convention on the Future of Europe. The three main challenges for the convention identified in the <Col N="794" /> European Council's Laeken declaration are how to bring citizens closer to the European Union and its institutions, how to organise Europe in an enlarged Union and how to develop the Union into a stabilising factor and a model in the new, multi-polar world. The declaration set out a series of questions to guide the work of the convention in these broad areas.</P>
    <P>The European Convention held its inaugural session on 28 February. The convention represents an important and timely opportunity to address certain key questions about the future of Europe as it stands on the brink of the most significant enlargement in its history. As I have made clear, the Government is approaching the convention in a positive and constructive way. It is our view that the convention should have a particular focus on bringing Europe closer to its citizens. The convention must listen closely to what the citizens of the EU are saying. As the Irish Government representative at the convention, Mr. Ray MacSharry, put it last week, we must listen to what our citizens are saying and we must listen even more when they do not speak. Our citizens want a more accessible Union in which jargon is minimised and procedures are simplified. They want a Union which is more transparent and which demonstrates more clearly its relevance to their lives.</P>
    <P>The convention will also examine how the functioning of the EU institutions can be streamlined so that the Union preserves and if possible increases its effectiveness, internally and externally, as it enlarges. An effectively functioning European Union is very much in Ireland's interests and we will press for real and practical improvements in its operation. However, we do not favour change for the sake of change and will seek to preserve the essential institutional balances from which the Union draws its strength and legitimacy. The convention is also expected to consider, as regards a wide range of policy areas, both how more effective action can be ensured as appropriate at European level and where action or the detailed implementation of measures is best left for decision at national level. The Government will support an appropriate balance in this regard.</P>
    <P>The early stages of the convention's deliberations are devoted to a listening exercise. Detailed consideration of particular issues is not expected to begin until later this year. The Government will consider publishing one or more discussion papers as the work of the convention proceeds and the key issues come into focus. The convention will be followed by an intergovernmental conference which Ireland will chair when it holds the Presidency in the first half of 2004. Decisions on any Treaty changes arising from the work of the convention will be for this conference.</P>

    <P>Mr. McDowell asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the initiatives Ireland proposes to <Col N="795" /> take to reduce the level of world resources being devoted to arms production, 846 billion dollars in 1995, at a time when a fraction of such resources would relieve the health and basic needs requirements of the countries to which such armaments are exported from countries of the developed world including a number in the European Union; if he has raised this matter at the European Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [10265/02]</P>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen): Ireland's approach to disarmament has always been consistent with our policy toward developing countries where the question of diversion of resources to arms procurement and the consequences of accumulations of weapons is of particular concern. Ireland has also continued to play a very active role in efforts to achieve total nuclear disarmament. The acquisition and maintenance of a nuclear arsenal is one of the costliest forms of the arms race. Ireland has been similarly active in international efforts to reduce the flow of small arms and light weapons and eliminate the use of land mines.</P>
    <P>With regard to nuclear weapons, Ireland has been consistently to the forefront in international efforts toward nuclear disarmament. The forum in which we are most active is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This treaty contains the only legally binding commitment to pursue nuclear disarmament which has been undertaken by the five nuclear weapon states. At the sixth review conference of states party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2000 Ireland was a key participant in the difficult negotiations which led to agreement on the final document of the conference. This final document outlines a significant number of steps to be taken by the nuclear weapons states to achieve the goal of total nuclear disarmament. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty cycle begins again in April this year and together with our New Agenda partners we will actively pursue progress on this blueprint for action. The New Agenda will present a working paper to the First Preparatory Committee on ways in which the steps agreed at the 2000 review conference might be implemented.</P>
    <P>In July of 2001 the UN Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its aspects took place in New York. Ireland played an active role in this conference and worked with European Union partners to achieve the strongest possible outcome. This conference was the first major step in addressing the problem of small arms proliferation and significantly, represented a formal recognition by the member states of the United Nations of the effects of the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons on civilian populations. The major issues dealt with by the conference were export criteria and controls, tracing and marking of weapons and regulation of brokers. The programme of action agreed, by consensus, contains politically binding commitments at <Col N="796" /> national, regional and international level. It also establishes a framework for follow-up action including provision for a review conference to be held in 2006.</P>
    <P>Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding on whether to allow an export of military goods. One of these criteria provides that member states should look at the level of expenditure of the recipient country on arms relative to their social expenditure, to ensure that the proposed export would not seriously hamper the sustainable development of the recipient country. The third annual report on the code of conduct which was adopted by the General Affairs Council in November 2001 set as one of the priorities for this year continuing efforts in the area of control of arms brokerage. Thus, discussion is ongoing in the European Union working group on arms exports, COARM, on how best to develop EU-wide regulation on the control of arms brokerage. The issue of arms brokerage is a particularly important one in controlling the spread of small arms and light weapons and work is continuing in various forums outside of the EU on this subject including the Wassenaar Arrangement of which Ireland is a member. Ireland supports efforts in these forums to regulate the activities of arms brokers and will play an active role both within the European Union and elsewhere in trying to achieve progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Ireland also played a key role in the negotiations for the 1997 Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and continues to advocate the need for all states to accede to the convention in order to ensure a worldwide ban on these weapons. Many countries which are parties to the convention and which are afflicted with mines will require international assistance in meeting their obligations under the convention. In recognition of this need Ireland has made ongoing contributions to humanitarian mine action programmes. Since 1994 Ireland has spent just under &euro;9 million on a wide variety of de-mining and rehabilitation projects as part of its humanitarian assistance projects. In September 2001 states party to the convention established an implementation support unit to assist in the work of the Ottawa Process inter-sessional meetings. These take place between and prepare for the annual meetings of states parties. Ireland has committed &euro;50,000 toward funding this unit.</P>

    <P>Mr. Stagg asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the progress made to date regarding the implementation of the Weston Park Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [10244/02]</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" />
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen): As the Deputy is aware, after discussions with the parties last July the two Governments, at the start of August, introduced our package of proposals which we believed could deliver the full and early implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Our proposals covered the four key outstanding aspects of the Agreement &ndash; policing, decommissioning, demilitarisation and stability in the institutions &ndash; as well as other issues, including the appointment of an international judge to investigate cases of grave public concern; a review of the Parades Commission and the legislation under which it operates; and the resolution of the situation of supporters of paramilitary organisations on ceasefire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions or extradition proceedings in relation to offences committed before 10 April 1998. The proposals also suggested that an implementation group of the parties committed to securing full implementation of the agreement be established.</P>
    <P>In the period since, we have been able to make considerable headway. Following the election of David Trimble and Mark Durkan as First and Deputy First Ministers respectively on 6 November, we have enjoyed a sustained period of full and inclusive operation of the institutions. On 30 November, the Taoiseach hosted highly productive summit level meetings of both the British-Irish Council and the North-South Ministerial Council in Dublin Castle. On 17 December, together with the First and Deputy First Ministers, I attended the first meeting of the NSMC in its Institutional Format &ndash; designed, under the agreement, to address institutional and cross-sectoral matters &ndash; in Stormont. The new Policing Board, established on 4 November, has made an encouraging start. It has been able to reach cross-community consensus on sensitive issues, including the design of a new policing badge and a response to the Ombudsman's report on the Omagh investigation. The board will now be responsible for the appointment of a successor to Chief Constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, who will step down at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Further steps have also been taken towards the achievement of a normal security environment in the North. In addition to the measures identified at Weston Park, the British Government has announced the removal of the military installation at Glasdrumman in South Armagh, and the closure of Ebrington Barracks in Derry. These are further welcome steps which will, I hope, be built upon in the period ahead. In October, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, under General John de Chastelain, reported that it had witnessed a significant event in which the IRA put some of its weapons beyond use. Obviously, I hope to see that process continue. I urge loyalist paramilitaries to address the question of their arms also.</P>
    <P>The governments are working together to identify a judge of international standing to undertake <Col N="798" /> a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion in cases of concern, including those of Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill. The British Government is also working to resolve the situation of so-called on-the-runs against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before 10 April 1998. Both governments accept that it would be a natural development of the accelerated release programme under the agreement for such prosecutions not to be pursued. The issue is a difficult one for the British Government but at his recent meeting with the Taoiseach in Barcelona the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, reiterated his intention to honour commitments in this area.</P>
    <P>The review of the operation of the Parades Commission is under way and is being chaired by Sir George Quigley. Any legislative changes it recommends would not take effect until after the summer of 2002. The first meeting of the implementation group will take place in Hillsborough tomorrow, when the Secretary of State and I will meet with representatives of the pro-agreement parties.</P>

    <P>Mr. Coveney asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the work that Irish aid agencies are undertaking in Afghanistan to provide humanitarian assistance. [10281/02]</P>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen): The Government is providing significant humanitarian support for Afghanistan, including through Irish non-governmental organisations with whom we have an established working partnership there. The Irish NGOs are and will continue to be key partners in the delivery of both our reconstruction and emergency support commitments. During 2001, the Government provided a total of &euro;5.08 million in emergency humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. Nearly &euro;2 million of this was channelled through Christian Aid Ireland, Concern, GOAL and Trócaire. 2002 marks the first year of the Government's pledge to provide &euro;12 million in reconstruction support to Afghani<Col N="799" /> stan over a three-year period. This will be provided in addition to our ongoing emergency humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>So far this year, a total of more than &euro;1 million has been provided between reconstruction support and humanitarian assistance with just over half of this having gone through Irish NGOs. Ireland Aid is working closely with Irish NGOs on the details of further expenditure to be channelled through the NGOs over the coming weeks. It is expected that our overall support for Afghanistan this year will equal, if not exceed, the &euro;5.08 million provided during 2001. The areas of work in which we have funded the Irish NGOs include support for Afghan refugees on the Pakistan border, notably in Peshawar and Quetta. They also include responding to the emergency food, water, shelter and health needs, among others, of those displaced within Afghanistan and those who are now returning to their communities of origin. Irish NGOs are also advancing programmes to assist the processes of national recovery and reconstruction. Geographically, their work extends from Herat in the West to Kabul in the East as well as to the northern and southern provinces.</P>
    <P>The work which the Irish NGOs are doing with Government support in Afghanistan has had to adapt to the changing situation on the ground. In these circumstances, we have allowed maximum operational flexibility so that aid can reach those most in need with maximum effect. In addition, Irish NGOs have a close working relationship with the international and other organisations which we also fund in that country. These include the World Food Programme, the UN High Commission for Refugees, UNICEF, the International Red Cross and Crescent and the International Organisation for Migration. As a contributing member state, Ireland also supports the funding of Irish NGOs through the European Community Humanitarian Office. They are also being supported by a variety of other donors including the United States and Britain. The Government will continue to support the work of Irish NGO partners in Afghanistan as a valued part of its ongoing humanitarian commitment to that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned at the suffering caused by the civil conflict in Algeria. Internal security remains extremely volatile &ndash; the recent period has been marked by a further increase in killings, with Islamic extremists continuing to target the civilian population. There has been some progress, most notably the Algerian Government's recent decision to recognise the Berber language. However, Ireland and our EU partners continue to urge Algeria to take further measures to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights. We hope the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Algeria will advance these necessary reforms. Ireland and our EU partners will again refer to the situation in Algeria at the current UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The Government of Algeria continue to oppose the appointment of a UN special rapporteur and it appears, as on previous occasions, there would be insufficient support among the current members of the UN Commission for Human Rights for such a proposal to succeed. In such circumstances, it would be counterproductive were a proposal to be made only to be defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports by the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the special rapporteur on torture are due to be considered at the forthcoming United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. It is expected these would, <i>inter alia</i>, comment on developments in Algeria. The question of access for special rapporteurs to report at first hand on human rights situations of concern in a number <Col N="801" /> of countries, not only Algeria, will also be an issue in Geneva. The EU will again call on Algeria to give access to these rapporteurs.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to present its view that a more co-operative approach by Algeria to the utilisation of the human rights protection machinery of the United Nations, including the role of special rapporteurs, would be a constructive step in helping to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the current tragic situation and to develop the rule of law and strengthen the democratic process in Algeria.</P>
    <P>When a delegation from the external relations directorate of the European Commission under the EU-sponsored initiative for human rights and democracy recently applied to visit Algeria, a problem arose with the visa applications. I am informed that this was of a technical nature. I understand the visit has had to be postponed, but that it is expected to go ahead in April. The visit is part of the EU's bilateral activities with Algeria to promote human rights and democracy and is part of the MEDA programme, the principal financial instrument of the EU for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. The human rights dialogue between the EU and Algeria will be enhanced by the recently negotiated EU-Algeria Association Agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. In particular, Article 2 of the agreement states that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will guide the internal and international policies of the parties and will constitute an essential element of the agreement. The agreement also commits Algeria to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. Ireland expects to see these commitments implemented fully in practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Punishment beatings, shootings and other acts of intimidation are barbaric practices which have no place in a democratic society. They are totally unacceptable. This has been communicated to all parties to the Good Friday Agreement, including Sinn Féin. The Government has consistently condemned punishment attacks and called for an <Col N="802" /> immediate end to all such acts of violence. The matter is discussed on an ongoing basis through the secretariat of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The statistics available show that punishment attacks rose by a third last year on the previous year, with loyalist paramilitaries clearly responsible for the majority of this increase. In 2001, 331 punishment attacks were recorded by the police &ndash; 212 have been attributed to loyalist paramilitaries, 121 shootings and 91 assaults, while republican paramilitaries were responsible for 119 such attacks, 66 shootings and 53 assaults.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of this year up to 10 March, 57 punishment attacks took place. Of these, 37 have been attributed to loyalist paramilitaries &ndash; 30 shootings and seven assaults &ndash; and 20 have been attributed to republican paramilitaries &ndash; 17 shootings and three assaults. This figure is nearly double the total number of attacks carried out by both loyalists and republicans for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>In so far as this jurisdiction is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that a particular Garda investigation is ongoing into certain events which might come within the terms of the question. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to make any further comment other than to say that any allegations of criminal activity of the kind referred to by the Deputy will be fully investigated by the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government unequivocally condemns the abhorrent practice of paramilitary exiling. I have frequently called for an end this unacceptable practice and have urged the political parties associated with paramilitary organisations to make every effort to ensure that all the exiles, wherever they currently reside, can return safely to their homes. There can be no justification for any paramilitary group in Northern Ireland to violate the right of all citizens to freely choose their place of residence, a fundamental right which has been recognised in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice of exiling, together with punishment attacks and other acts of intimidation, is contrary to the rule of law, the Good Friday Agreement and the Mitchell Principles. As the Taoiseach has made clear, the best way of ending these practices is through support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. One of the long-<Col N="803" /> standing difficulties in dealing with the issue of exiling has been the lack of accurate information available about the extent of the practice. This issue has been the subject of regular discussions with the British authorities who have informed us that, while statistics on reported incidents of general intimidation are maintained, official figures are neither compiled nor issued by the police on the number of people exiled by paramilitaries. Given the nature of the problem, with neither the groups involved in making the threats nor those who receive them likely to make such information available to the authorities, the police were of the opinion that any such figures may not reflect the true nature of the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand a report on this issue has been prepared by Phase II, an organisation run by the Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, NIACRO, and is due to be published shortly. According to media accounts, the Phase II report states that 683 people were told to leave Northern Ireland by paramilitary groups last year with twice as many threats coming from Loyalist paramilitaries, 64%, as from Republican paramilitaries, 32%. The majority of the threats were issued in the greater Belfast area, but incidents and expulsions also occurred in Lisburn, Antrim, Newtownards, Derry, Bangor and Portadown. We will consider the contents of this report closely when it is published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 75 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, to bring together those with executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government to develop co-operation, consultation and action within the island of Ireland on matters of mutual interest within the competence of both administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed that the NSMC would focus initially on 12 areas of co-operation. Co-oper<Col N="804" /> ation is under way through existing bodies and Departments in six of these areas; agriculture, education, environment, health, transport and tourism, where a new company, Tourism Ireland Limited, has been established to market the island of Ireland abroad as a single tourist destination. Six new implementation bodies were established to develop North-South co-operation in the remaining areas; Waterways Ireland; the Food Safety Promotion Board; InterTrade Ireland; the Special EU Programmes Body; the Language Body; and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, FCILC, which comprises two agencies &ndash; the Loughs Agency and the Lights Agency. As regards the latter, a number of technical issues have arisen in relation to the transfer of the functions of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to the FCILC Lights Agency and a working group of officials is examining the question with a view to making proposals as to how best to proceed.</P>
    <P>The North-South Ministerial Council has met 53 times since December 1999 including three times in plenary format, most recently in November 2001, and in institutional format last December. A significant body of work in the 12 areas of co-operation has been taken forward in partnership by the relevant Departments and agencies under the direction of Ministers from North and South. The obvious benefit of working together on issues of mutual interest is such that consideration is now being given to the question of expanding the areas of co-operation within the NSMC.</P>
    <P>In the economic field, North-South co-operation takes place on a range of economic issues to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island. The North-South trade and business development body, InterTrade Ireland, plays a leading role in identifying and facilitating existing and potential economic co-operation. Working in close collaboration with the relevant Departments and the existing development agencies, InterTrade Ireland has a strong focus on building business links, increasing North-South trade, and developing competitiveness and enterprise capability. A report on enhancing competitiveness was submitted to the NSMC at the plenary meeting held in Dublin Castle on 30 November 2001. This report covers a broad spectrum of issues across a range of administrative functions, including energy, research and development, telecommunications and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>As regards other aspects of Strand Two of the Agreement, work is under way to give effect to the provision regarding the establishment of an independent consultative forum. A North-South working group is currently consulting the Northern Ireland civic forum and the central review mechanism of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness with a view to bringing forward proposals for consideration at the next plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council. The next plenary will also consider the results of a consultation process currently under way with <Col N="805" /> regard to a report commissioned by the NSMC into obstacles to cross-border mobility. Work is also under way to give effect to the provision regarding NSMC consideration of the European Union dimension of relevant matters, including the implementation of EU policies and programmes and proposals under consideration in the EU framework. A North-South working group has been tasked with bringing forward proposals on the arrangements to be made to ensure that the views of the NSMC are taken into account and represented appropriately at relevant EU meetings.  </P>
    <P>The Government is very pleased with the level of progress within the NSMC since its establishment in December 1999. Without exception, all meetings of the council have taken place in a positive, constructive atmosphere and an extensive programme of work is under way across the various sectors involved. The experience of working the North-South institutions has demonstrated the tangible benefits of a constructive partnership between both parts of the island.</P>

      <P>The task force on policy regarding emigrants established in December 2001, has been asked to recommend a coherent long-term policy approach to meeting the needs of emigrants, focusing especially on the needs of the young and vulnerable in the three areas of pre-departure services, services for emigrants overseas and services to returning emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its discussions to date, the approach of the task force has been to deal separately with each of these three areas. The task force held its first meeting on 12 December 2001 and has held four meetings since then. The discussion on pre-departure services was based on presentations made by Mr. Aidan Punch, senior statistician in the Central Statistics Office, and Ms Anne O'Donovan, Co-ordinator of Emigrant Advice, a voluntary body that provides an information service for intending emigrants. On foot of the presentation from the CSO, the task force decided to commission a research study in order to review existing statistical data in Ireland and other countries, to identify more clearly the nature and the extent of Irish emigration and the problems faced by Irish emigrants abroad, and to highlight further statistical research that should be conducted in the future. The results of this study will be available by the middle of May, in time to feed into the drafting of the task force's report. The discussion on services for returning emigrants has been based on presentations by Dr. Gerry <Col N="806" /> Cowley, chairman of the safe home programme in Mulranny, County Mayo, and Dr. Nessa Winston, a lecturer in the Department of Social Policy in UCD, who has been conducting research into the area of returning emigrants.</P>
    <P>The task force has attached considerable importance to consulting with organisations and individuals involved in the field of emigration to ensure that anyone who wishes to contribute to its work is able to do so. A notice was placed in the national papers &ndash; and in the Irish papers in the UK, US and Australia &ndash; inviting submissions from the public. Approximately 80 responses have been received so far. A further 37 reports have been received from Irish Missions abroad detailing the number and situation of Irish emigrants in their countries of accreditation. The task force has also invited a number of experts in this area to make presentations at its meetings. Members of the task force visited the US in February to meet with Irish Consular officials and voluntary organisations providing services to emigrants in that country. They are currently in Australia for the same purpose. Members also plan to visit the UK early in April.</P>
    <P>Consideration of the issue of services to emigrants abroad will take place when the visits of the task force abroad have been completed. My understanding is that it is the intention of the task force to start drafting its report in May with a view to presenting it by the end of June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 31 October last year, the European Commission published a report by Professor Richard Sinnott on the findings of a poll carried out the previous August on voter behaviour and attitudes in relation to the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. The poll covered a wide range of questions and the report analysed a wide range of factors affecting voter behaviour. Professor Sinnott identified the main reason for the very high rate of abstention as relating to a perceived lack of information or lack of understanding of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>In response to the report, I suggested, <i>inter alia</i>, that the results showed the need for an extensive national debate on Europe and the need to inform the Irish people how important the EU has been and will continue to be for Ireland, and that choices to be made on the future of the EU were choices about the future of Ireland as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" />The Government has worked actively and constructively to address some of the key concerns which arose during the referendum campaign. The establishment of the National Forum on Europe has encouraged a wide-ranging debate on issues relating to the European Union and Ireland's role in that Union. The Government has brought forward proposals to improve scrutiny by the Oireachtas of EU affairs. When fully implemented, these measures will put Ireland's scrutiny arrangements on a par with the best in Europe and will contribute significantly to a fuller understanding of Ireland's role and influence in EU decision-making.</P>
    <P>The Government is also examining ways in which the communication to ordinary people of how Europe operates and affects their lives could be significantly improved. Through its national representative, Mr. Ray MacSharry, it is engaging constructively in the European convention on the future of Europe which has recently got under way. The Government takes the view that one of the most fundamental questions that must be addressed is the sense of disconnection between the EU and many of its citizens and that the convention provides an important and timely forum for addressing this challenge.</P>
    <P>At the Barcelona European Council on 15 and 16 March, the Taoiseach outlined the Government's approach to the ratification of the Nice treaty and reiterated the Government's commitment to completing that process before the end of the year so as to allow enlargement to take place on schedule. He indicated that a declaration confirming that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is not affected by the treaties would be helpful in this regard. The European Council welcomed the Government's approach and reiterated its willingness to contribute in every way to support the Government in the process of ratification and agreed to come back to the issue at its next meeting in Seville in June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's election to the Security Council for the 2001-2 term, with the support of a very large majority of UN member states, represented a major vote of confidence in our foreign policy. Our approach to issues on the council agenda has been based on our traditional commitment to peacekeeping, disarmament, human rights and development co-operation. We have sought to ensure that the human rights of individuals and the humanitarian needs of populations remain central to discussions at the Security Council and have stressed at all times the need to address the <Col N="808" /> root causes of conflict and to respect the principles of international law.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied this constructive, practical approach has borne fruit and that we have impacted significantly on the council's activities across a wide range of difficult conflict situations. Our contribution to conflict resolution, peacekeeping, peace building, the promotion of human rights and addressing the humanitarian needs of populations in crisis has been of the highest order.</P>
      <P>On the Middle East we have been active in efforts to identify potential middle ground on an issue on which the council is divided. I believe our approach contributed to the recent adoption of the landmark resolution 1397. As chair of the UN sanctions committee on Angola we have made considerable progress in tightening the economic pressure on UNITA with the aim of bringing an end to the military action which has caused so much suffering to the people of Angola.</P>
      <P>On East Timor we have been instrumental in ensuring a strong UN presence to assist the East Timorese people in the development of their fledgling state following independence next May. Against the backdrop of our long-standing experience in UN peacekeeping, Ireland has been particularly active in discussions on the important issue of strengthening co-operation between the Security Council and the countries which contribute troops to UN missions.</P>
      <P>Membership of the council has also afforded us the opportunity to work to improve UN sanctions regimes. There is no doubt that specifically targeted sanctions play an important role where flagrant breaches of international law occur or there is a threat to international peace. There is a strong balancing objective to ensure that the civilian population of the country against whose government the sanctions are imposed does not suffer.</P>
      <P>Our Presidency of the council in October 2001 was highly successful. I visited New York twice during the month and chaired sessions of the council, as well as meeting with the UN Secretary General key UN officials and other members of the council. While the events of 11 September overshadowed our Presidency, we reacted rapidly and effectively to the challenge and as Presidency advanced the role of the UN in the international fight against terrorism and work to reconstruct Afghanistan. From the first days of our Security Council term Ireland was instrumental in focusing the attention of the Council on the grave humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and in October we initiated weekly briefings on the situation there. Subsequent Presidencies have continued our practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has made a very positive and substantive contribution to the work of the Security Council. We have brought a fresh perspective and an objective approach to its work which I know is welcome to and respected by other member states. We have played an important role on the council and we will continue to use our position <Col N="809" /> to promote Ireland's values and objectives in the pursuit of international peace and security and human rights for all.</P>

      <P>Members will be aware from my previous statements to the House on Afghanistan, that the US-led action against the Al Qaeda network and Taliban regime began on 7 October 2001. Less than a month later, major cities throughout northern Afghanistan fell to the US-backed Northern Alliance. Kabul followed on 13 November, and the last major Taliban strongholds in the south collapsed a month later. Since then, the interim authority, under the chairmanship of Hamid Karzai, took office on 22 December, as provided by the terms of the Bonn Agreement, reached by Afghan parties, on 5 December. This agreement further provided for an International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan &ndash; ISAF. It achieved full deployment of some 4,800 members in Afghanistan by mid-February.</P>
      <P>On 13 March, the Taoiseach met President Bush in Washington. The President acknowledged Ireland's sympathetic reaction to the events of last September, and for our assistance since, on overflight facilities in the control of terrorist finances and our participation in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The President said the first phase, to defeat the Taliban, had been completed, and that the next phase, to deny them sanctuary, was under way.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware from reports this month that reinforced ground force operations have been undertaken in Afghanistan. These operations are to eliminate remaining pockets of resistance from Al Qaeda and Taliban members. Operation Anaconda was launched on 2 March, in the eastern Afghan province of Paktia. Around 1,000 US troops and the same number of Afghan troops were involved. Last week, the British Government confirmed the deployment, in coming weeks, of further troops. I understand a total of 1,700 royal marines and army commandos are expected to take up duty for a period of three months, and may be replaced if required after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall, the past months have seen significant events in the path towards the establishment of peace and stability in Afghanistan. Ireland, together with its EU partners, continues to support and promote the UN-led process and efforts of the Secretary General and his special representative, Ambassador Brahimi. The EU special representative for Afghanistan, Mr. Klaiber, is key <Col N="810" /> to the co-ordination of EU efforts to assist the Afghan process.</P>
    <P>While there is progress towards reconciliation and a representative government in Afghanistan, as well as in eliminating the use of Afghan territory by terrorists, and in curbing narcotics production and trafficking, enormous challenges remain for the people of Afghanistan. At the ministerial conference on the Reconstruction of Afghanistan in Tokyo in January, the international community pledged $4.5 billion in assistance to Afghanistan. On behalf of Ireland, I pledged &euro;12 million over 3 years in reconstruction, in addition to ongoing humanitarian assistance which, in 2002, is likely to exceed the &euro;5 million contributed in 2001.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Secretary General reported on the situation in Afghanistan and its implications for international peace and security. This report summarised the key developments in Afghanistan since the signing of the Bonn Agreement and proposed a structure for the UN presence in Afghanistan, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Bonn Agreement, and taking into account current political, security and humanitarian conditions in the country. I have arranged for a copy of this report to be lodged in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>While overall responsibility for the pharmacy sector rests with the Minister for Health and Children, my interest as Minister with responsibility for competition, is to seek to ensure as far as possible that regulatory reform takes due account of the interests of consumers and the importance of competition in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my attention was drawn to restrictions on entry to the retail pharmacy profession a number of years ago, I have advocated the lifting of <Col N="811" /> restrictions on entry to the profession particularly those related to population and distance criteria as set out in the now revoked* Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996. I also met the Irish Pharmaceutical Union at its request where I explained my opposition to the maintenance of artificial restrictions on entry to the profession.</P>
    <P>Since I became aware of the restrictions, the OECD has also commented adversely in regard to competition in the retail pharmacy area and the Minister for Health and Children set up a review of the regulations governing pharmacy. The position, therefore, is that I have been advocating deregulation since before the OECD report and also prior to the Minister for Health and Children setting up a review of the regulations governing pharmacy.</P>

      <P>Research conducted for this Department has <Col N="812" /> shown that insurance premiums are high in Ireland mainly due to the number and level of compensation awards to policyholders. The costs of delivery of compensation run at approximately 40% of the cost of claims.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to establish a personal injuries assessment board, PIAB, with a view to reducing the costs of delivery of compensation in personal injuries cases. It is expected the PIAB will, in time, substantially reduce the number of personal injury claims being brought to court, thus reducing the legal and other costs involved in the delivery of personal injury compensation. It is also expected that the PIAB should bring about a more consistent settlement of claims that would be fairer to claimants generally.</P>
      <P>Work on the establishment of the PIAB is in progress. I await the report of the interdepartmental implementation group that was set up to progress the establishment of the PIAB so that the board may be set up as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to further mergers within the insurance industry, it is intended that responsibility for merger control, except in the media sector, will be transferred to the Competition Authority in accordance with the Competition Bill, when enacted. It should be noted that large scale mergers involving significant international players and which impact across the EU are generally required to be notified to the EU Commission under EU merger regulation.</P>
      <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU third framework insurance directives in 1994, insurance companies authorised in any one member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries. I have encouraged such competition. For this reason also, I welcome a number of initiatives being taken by the EU in its financial services action plan. In addition, the removal of the &ldquo;cap&rdquo; on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>

      <P>The Council agreed to publish the study to allow interested organisations, including Departments, and individuals, to express their views on the recommendations and their implementation.

      <P>The Government decided in September 2000 to move progressively to the UN target for overseas development of 0.7% of GNP. The intention is that this target will be met by 2007 and that an interim target of 0.45% of GNP will be achieved by the end of 2002.</P>

    <P>Of the total of &euro;372 million available for 2002, some &euro;254 million is being allocated to subhead B, the bilateral grant-in-aid. This amount differs from figures quoted in previous replies because administrative costs, previously covered as part of this subhead, have since been re-allocated to a new administrative budget, subhead A. A detailed breakdown of the total allocation of &euro;372 million by subhead is provided in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2002.</P>
    <P>Achievement of the 0.7% target will require further annual increases in funding and it is anticipated that the budget required in 2007 will be almost &euro;1 billion. An increase of this order of magnitude will offer significant opportunities to strengthen our support across all areas of the existing programme as well as allowing scope for possible expansion in new directions and in the geographical spread of the programme.</P>
    <P>The reduction of poverty in its various manifestations is at the heart of Ireland's programme of assistance to developing countries. All of Ireland Aid's activities are planned with reference to the impact that they are likely to have in this regard. In addition, the geographical focus of the programme is primarily on developing countries in Africa. Increased funding is being made available in 2002 for all subheads. Under the bilateral aid subhead, support is given to a wide range of activities which combat poverty and starvation, while assistance under the subhead for the work of NGOs at local level will increase by one third over 2001. Significantly increased funding is also <Col N="816" /> being set aside for humanitarian relief in respect of disasters world wide.</P>
    <P>Funding across the programme is allocated in a variety of ways. Support for the priority country programmes under the Bilateral Aid programme, for example, is channelled in the first instance through the Irish diplomatic missions in those countries. Funding for multilateral organisations is directed to the EU and various agencies of the United Nations. Support is made available to numerous NGOs either directly by the Development Co-operation Division in the form of block grants or co-financing of specific projects or via Irish diplomatic missions at local level.</P>
    <P>My Department operates an extensive range of appraisal and evaluation mechanisms to ensure the effectiveness, sustainability and value for money of programmes supported. All budget lines are submitted for advance approval to an interdepartmental committee, on which the Department of Finance and other Departments interested in aid are represented. New proposals are approved in a three stage process which involves the use of independent consultants and with an interdepartmental committee as the final stage. Ireland Aid has an evaluation and audit unit which carries out an annual series of evaluations of various programmes and projects. The programme is subject to review by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee and my Department also participates in the system of public expenditure reviews co-ordinated through the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 93, 102, 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The statement made to Dáil Éireann on 20 March by the Taoiseach, as well as my own reply to Priority Question No. 23 of today's date, together confirm the content of discussion which took place at the Barcelona European Council in relation to Ireland and ratification of the Nice treaty.</P>
      <P>All member states are committed to the ratification of the Nice treaty by the end of 2002 so that enlargement can proceed on schedule. Beyond that, no formal undertaking was given to EU partners in relation to the precise timing of a second referendum, although the Taoiseach referred to the general recognition and expectation which exists that such a referendum would be held in the autumn. Neither was any formal understanding or arrangement reached with EU partners concerning the treaty itself beyond a reiteration of the Government's full commitment to enlargement of the Union and to treaty ratification.</P>
      <P>A protocol to the Nice treaty is not feasible. Rather, the Government will seek a declaration from the Seville European Council which will confirm that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality is not affected by the Nice treaty. Our partners indicated they would be positively disposed to this approach, and this is reflected in the Barcelona conclusions.</P>
      <P>The Government has also recognised that other concerns arose during the referendum campaign and is working actively and constructively to address these. The establishment of the National Forum on Europe has encouraged an important, wide-ranging and overdue debate on issues relating to the European Union and Ireland's role in that Union. The Government has brought forward proposals to improve significantly scrutiny by the Oireachtas of EU affairs. When fully implemented, these measures will put Ireland's scrutiny arrangements on a par with the best in Europe and will contribute significantly to a fuller understanding of Ireland's role and influence in EU decision-making. The Government is also examining ways in which the communication to ordinary people of how Europe operates and affects their lives could be significantly improved. Through its national representative, Mr. Ray MacSharry, it is engaging constructively in the European Convention on the Future of Europe that recently got under way. The Government takes the view that one of the most fundamental questions that must be addressed is the sense of disconnection between the EU and many of its citizens and that the convention provides an important and timely forum for addressing this challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2001, UNAIDS estimated that more than 40 million people were infected with the HIV-AIDS virus, of which 27 million live in sub-Saharan Africa. The spread of the disease in Africa is undermining years of development progress. In some southern African countries, one adult in three is infected and life expectancy is declining from over 60 to a projected 45 years. Africa now has over 11 million HIV-AIDS orphans.</P>
      <P>In countries where the Government has promoted strong and effective prevention and education campaigns, HIV-AIDS rates have declined. Uganda, for example, has seen its HIV-AIDS rate decline from over 20% of the adult population to less than 10%. The UN Secretary General has identified strong political leadership as the single most important contribution to the fight against the disease.</P>
      <P>In January 2000, Ireland Aid published a HIV-AIDS strategy and integrated the fight against the disease into all of its development activities. The priority issues in the HIV-AIDS programme include: pressing for strong political leadership in Africa to deal with prevention, education and treatment; calling for increased international funding as the crisis demands a global response; supporting the right of poor countries to have access to life-saving medicines at affordable prices; acting in partnership with NGOs, particularly in the care of children orphaned by the HIV-AIDS epidemic; supporting the international search for a HIV-AIDS vaccine.</P>
      <P>In response to the spread of the epidemic and its impact on development, Ireland Aid is further strengthening its response to the HIV-AIDS crisis. In June 2001, at the UN Special Session on HIV-AIDS, the Taoiseach gave a commitment that Ireland would spend an additional &euro;34 million per annum on the fight against HIV-AIDS. In 2002, Ireland Aid will spend an estimated &euro;50 million on HIV-AIDS programmes, up from &euro;19 million in 2001. Ireland has announced that it will contribute &euro;10 million in 2002 to the Global Fund to fight HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB. Ireland actively participated in the international effort to establish the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the WTO ministerial meeting in Doha in November 2001, Ireland and its EU partners supported the Declaration on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and the Declaration on Public Health. The declaration affirms that the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement should be interpreted in a manner which promotes access to medicines for all. In 2002, Ireland Aid will signifi<Col N="819" /> cantly increase its spending on HIV-AIDS programmes in Africa. Our support for the HIV-AIDS activities of both Irish and international NGOs will also increase. Ireland will contribute more than &euro;2 million to the international aids vaccine initiative which is leading the international search for a HIV-AIDS vaccine. Ireland will increase its support to UNAIDS to &euro;2.95 million in 2002, from &euro;1 million in 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has played a very active role in efforts to achieve disarmament and to work against the proliferation of weapons. These efforts are carried out multilaterally and primarily through the United Nations.</P>
      <P>With regard to nuclear weapons, Ireland has been consistently to the forefront in international efforts towards nuclear disarmament. The forum in which we are most active is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This treaty contains the only legally binding commitment to pursue nuclear disarmament which has been undertaken by the five nuclear weapon states.</P>
      <P>At the Sixth Review Conference of States Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2000 Ireland was a key participant in the difficult negotiations which led to agreement on the final document of the conference. This final document outlines a significant number of steps to be taken by the nuclear weapons states to achieve the goal of total nuclear disarmament. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty cycle begins again in April this year and together with our New Agenda partners we will actively pursue progress on this blueprint for action. The New Agenda will present a working paper to the First Preparatory Committee on ways in which the steps agreed at the 2000 Review Conference might be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July of 2001 the UN Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects took place in New York. Ireland played a very active role in this conference and worked with European Union partners to achieve the strongest possible outcome. This conference was the first major step in addressing the problem of small arms proliferation and significantly, represented a formal recognition by the member states of the United Nations of the effects of the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons on civilian populations. The major issues dealt with by the conference were export criteria and controls, tracing and marking of weapons and regulation of brokers. The programme of action agreed by consensus contains politically binding commitments at national, regional and international level. It also <Col N="820" /> establishes a framework for follow-up action including provision for a review conference to be held in 2006.</P>
    <P>Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports which was adopted by the European Council in 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding on whether to allow an export of military goods.</P>
    <P>The third annual report on the code of conduct which was adopted by the General Affairs Council in November 2001 set as one of the priorities for this year, continuing efforts in the area of control of arms brokerage. Thus, discussion is ongoing in the European Union working group on arms exports &ndash; COARM &ndash; on how best to develop EU-wide regulation on the control of arms brokerage. The issue of arms brokerage is a particularly important one in controlling the spread of small arms and light weapons and work is continuing in various fora outside of the EU on this subject including the Wassenaar Arrangement, of which Ireland is a member. Ireland supports efforts in these fora to regulate the activities of arms brokers and will play an active role both within the European Union and elsewhere in trying to achieve progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Ireland also played a key role in the negotiations for the 1997 Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and continues to advocate the need for all states to accede to the convention in order to ensure a world wide ban on these weapons. Many countries which are parties to the convention and which are afflicted with mines will require international assistance in meeting their obligations under the convention. In recognition of this need Ireland has made ongoing contributions to humanitarian mine action programmes. Since 1994, Ireland has spent just under &euro;9 million on a wide variety of demining and rehabilitation projects as part of its humanitarian assistance projects. In September 2001, states parties to the convention established an implementation support unit to assist in the work of the Ottawa Process intersessional meetings &ndash; these take place between and prepare for the annual meetings of states parties. Ireland has committed &euro;50,000 toward funding this implementation support unit.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 23 of 7 February 2002 in which I drew attention to the fact that numerous commitments have been made by Ireland to conflict prevention activities in the context of our bilateral development assist<Col N="821" /> ance programmes. Along with our EU partners, Ireland remains committed to extensive co-ordination and co-operation arrangements with relevant UN agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, which has conflict prevention as part of its mandate.</P>

      <P>Ireland's approach to conflict prevention remains under regular review by my Department, particularly in the context of implementation of the EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts as endorsed at the Gothenburg European Council in June 2001.

      <P>I am aware of the concerns of the World Archaeological Congress and others about the construction of the Ilisu dam on the Tigris River in southeastern Turkey. These concerns relate to the effects which construction of the dam may have on the local population, its impact on cultural heritage in the area, particularly the great archaeological sites of Hasankeyf, and the reported lack of adequate consultation with the affected communities on resettlement issues and local claims to cultural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 December last, the committee on culture, science and education of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe approved an information report on the cultural aspects of the Ilisu dam project. The report was prepared by the committee's general rapporteur on cultural heritage, Mrs. Vlasta Stepová. I presume it is this report to which the Deputy's question refers. It is hoped the Turkish authorities will carefully bear in mind the legitimate concerns which have been expressed about the project. In this context, the information report prepared by the committee on culture, science and education of the parliamentary assembly represents an important contribution to discussion. However, as the Deputy is <Col N="822" /> aware, its conclusions would not be shared by all those with an interest in the matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to the case of the woman sentenced to death by stoning, Deputies will be aware that on Monday, 25 March, the Sharia court of appeal in the state of Sokoto overturned the conviction for adultery. I welcome the decision of the court of appeal to overturn the conviction. I am particularly pleased that the decision was taken at state level. This removed the need for an appeal to the federal court which would have prolonged the suffering of the woman in question.</P>
      <P>Throughout the legal process we made our views known to the Nigerian authorities. I remain concerned at the inhumane nature of the sentence originally imposed and the existence of such laws in Nigeria. In this regard I am aware of reports of the imposition of the death penalty in a similar case and I have asked my officials to obtain further details with a view to taking up the issue. Together with my European Union colleagues, we also urge the Nigerian Government to work towards the immediate abolition of the death penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 105 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-Congolese dialogue seeks to bring together the various actors in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC. Following initial difficulties as to the entitlement of <Col N="823" /> one party to attend the talks, the dialogue was successfully launched on 25 February. However, the town of Moliro on Lake Tanganyika was occupied by the Congolese Rally for Democracy rebels on 15 March. This major violation of the ceasefire agreement was strongly condemned by Ireland at the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>As a result of the occupation of Moliro, the Government of the DRC withdrew from the inter-Congolese dialogue in Sun City. We view the inter-Congolese dialogue as a crucial element of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement as it is intended to lead to representative governance and democratic elections in the DRC. The European Council meeting in Barcelona on 15 March expressed concern at developments and regretted the effect that these developments have had on the evolution of the inter-Congolese dialogue.</P>
    <P>On 19 March, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1399 which condemns the capture of Moliro by the RCD and demands that the rebel troops withdraw immediately and unconditionally from the town. The resolution stresses that no party to the Lusaka ceasefire agreement should make military gains while a peace process is under way and a peacekeeping operation is deployed. It further calls on the Government of the DRC to resume its participation in the inter-Congolese dialogue.</P>
    <P>On March 21, following negotiations between the parties to the conflict, an agreement was reached in Lusaka that the RCD and the government of the DRC will mutually and expeditiously withdraw their forces from four locations in the eastern half of the DRC. The withdrawal of troops will be monitored by MONUC, the United Nations peacekeeping force in the DRC. Following this agreement, the Government of the DRC resumed its participation in the inter-Congolese dialogue.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that the peace agreement is now at a critical juncture and will continue to closely monitor the situation in the DRC. We welcome the swift resolution of the recent ceasefire violation and we urge all parties to the inter-Congolese dialogue to participate in a constructive manner for the benefit of the Congolese people.</P>

      <P>There is currently a network of 50 embassies, five multilateral missions and 11 consulates general and other offices abroad. The embassies and consulates established in the last five years are as follows: Embassies: Brazil, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey: Consulates: Cardiff, Edinburgh, Shanghai and Sydney.</P>
      <P>Ireland does not have a consulate in the Faroe Islands at present. The spread of resident Irish missions abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. As the Deputy will appreciate, however, constraints on Government expenditure and the limits on the resources that could be made available for opening new missions require that any expansion of our diplomatic network must be incremental and based on a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to his questions of 7 February 2002, in which I outlined my general position, and that of the EU, regarding the development and maintenance of stability in the western Balkans. Since 7 February several encouraging moves towards peace and the establishment of democracy in the region have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement, brokered on 14 March by Javier Solana, between Serbian and Montenegrin leaders on a new joint state of Serbia and Montenegro, was welcomed by the European Council. Once ratified by all parties, this new state will replace the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, coming after ten years of conflict and instability, marks an important contribution to the stability and development of the western Balkans. A key factor in the successful conclusion of negotiations was the acknowledgement by both the Serbian and Montenegrin sides that engagement, in particular economic engagement, with the European Union was vital to their shared future. Much work remains to be done on both sides in order to ensure the viability of the new state, particularly from an economic perspective. The EU has <Col N="825" /> declared its support in the context of the stabilisation and association process (SAP) and has also offered its advice and assistance to the new state.</P>
    <P>Political consultations between officials from my Department and Foreign Minister Svilanovic and his officials took place in Belgrade last week. During discussions with Mr. Svilanovic, my officials stressed, <i>inter alia</i>, the need for better co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY, and the issue of the release or relocation to Kosovo of the remaining Kosovar Albanian prisoners in Serbia. In this regard I was very pleased to learn that all of the prisoners were released to the custody of UNMIK on Tuesday, 26 March. Discussions also took place on economic development and the deepening of bilateral relations between our two countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with our EU partners, has welcomed the recent positive developments in Kosovo, namely the election by the new Assembly of the President of Kosovo, Mr. Ibrahim Rugova, and the establishment of a government led by Prime Minister Rexhepi, which mark an important step forward in the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999).</P>
    <P>On 22 February the Albanian Parliament approved the appointment of the new Prime Minister Pandeli Majko. This is an important step forward for the country following months of political instability and Mr. Majko and his cabinet have stated that their top priorities are to fight against corruption and illegal trafficking and to work towards Albania's integration into Europe. It is hoped that this will give a new impetus to the reform process and lead to the opening of real dialogue between the EU and Albania on a stabilisation and association agreement, SAA.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, on the implementation of the Framework Agreement, which enabled a donors' conference for the country to go ahead on 12 March. The conference drew pledges of &euro;307 million for the reconstruction of war damaged infrastructure, implementation of economic reforms and support for the Framework Agreement. Ireland pledged &euro;315,000 at the conference, a 20% increase on our funding for FYROM in 2001.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to support the policy of the EU that concentrating the energies of the region on economic development, institutional reform and European integration is the best way to bring about stability and overcome conflict. The EU is committed to continuing economic assistance under the SAP, which represents the best way forward in terms of the integration of the western Balkans countries into European structures while building regional structures.</P>

      <P>The issue of human rights in Chechnya will be discussed at the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), which began in Geneva on 18 March and will continue until the end of April.</P>
      <P>The Russian Federation has made it clear that it is opposed to the adoption of a resolution on human rights in Chechnya by the Commission on Human Rights, and that it does not wish to see continued discussion of the situation in Chechnya at the UNCHR in future years. The Russian Federation viewed last year's resolution on this issue as &ldquo;unobjective and unbalanced&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, takes the view that despite progress since last year, there remains serious cause for concern regarding the protection of the human rights of civilians in Chechnya. We acknowledge the right of the Government of the Russian Federation to defend its territorial integrity, to fight against terrorism and crime and to protect its population, and we welcome recent moves by the Russian Federation to improve the investigation of human rights violations. However, the fight against terrorism must be conducted in accordance with internationally accepted human rights standards. Credible reports of human rights violations perpetrated both by Chechen fighters and by the Russian security forces are still emerging.</P>
      <P>Ireland considers that our concerns in this respect must be raised in the context of the Commission on Human Rights. Discussions are under way with our EU partners to enable us to reach an understanding with Russia on an agreed chairman's statement on Chechnya which would highlight our continuing concern.</P>

      <P>The significant humanitarian support being provided by the Government to Afghanistan points to the enormity of the task which we and other members of the international donor community face in helping the vulnerable people of that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan which I attended in Tokyo on 21 January, Ireland and other international donors made combined pledges of $1.8 billion to Afghanistan for 2002 and in excess of $4.5 billion to cover the next five years. This year marks the first phase of the <Col N="827" /> Government's Tokyo pledge to provide &euro;12 million in reconstruction support over a three-year period. At the same time, we are continuing to respond to the humanitarian crisis. So far this year, a total of over &euro;1 million has been provided between humanitarian assistance and reconstruction support. This dual approach by the Government is intended to assist progress in terms of both the survival and recovery of the Afghan people. It means that our combined support for Afghanistan this year will equal, if not exceed, the &euro;5.08 million provided during 2001.</P>
    <P>The real challenge facing the international donor community is to deliver on their reconstruction pledges while continuing to respond effectively to the humanitarian crisis. Millions of Afghans remain at risk and face the prospect of a fourth successive year of drought on top of ongoing food shortages, displacement, sporadic conflict and the severities of winter. The situation on the ground remains both complex and volatile. While thousands of refugees are now returning to Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran, an estimated 47,000 new refugees have fled Afghanistan since the start of this year due to drought, insecurity and ethnic tensions. Aid agencies are having to be extremely flexible in responding to these developments.</P>
    <P>In many remote areas, insecurity, poor infrastructure and a lack of communications are continuing to hamper the international relief effort. The World Food Programme is implementing helicopter-assisted responses in severely affected areas. Irish and other non-governmental organisations are arranging special animal convoys to deliver food to areas made inaccessible to trucks by the winter snows. It is recognised by the aid community in Afghanistan that the humanitarian emergency is set to continue in that country for at least the next 18 months.</P>
    <P>In his report on the situation in Afghanistan of 18 March 2002, the UN Secretary General has reiterated that Afghanistan will require massive amounts of international assistance for the foreseeable future in order to meet current humanitarian needs, initiate recovery and work towards the long-term reconstruction of the country. The challenges of responding adequately to the needs of the Afghan people are, therefore, set to continue for some time and leave no room for complacency. The Government will continue to reflect the spirit of the Secretary General's report by responding substantially to both the ongoing humanitarian emergency and the longer-term needs of reconstruction in Afghanistan.</P>

      <P>Since my reply to the Deputy on this matter last month, Ireland has continued to give prominence to Somalia at the UN Security Council. We have reiterated our support for the Arta peace process, which continues to be the most viable basis for peace and national reconciliation in Somalia, and reaffirmed our commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia.</P>
      <P>Ireland strongly supports the forthcoming National Reconciliation Conference, due to be held in Kenya in April 2002. We urge all parties in Somalia to participate constructively in the conference and we welcome the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to co-ordinate their efforts for national reconciliation in Somalia.</P>
      <P>We call on all states in the region to use their influence to bring on board Somali groups that have not yet joined the peace process. Ireland is a member of the International Partners' Forum &ndash; IPF &ndash; which seeks to support the work of the IGAD.</P>
      <P>Ireland continues to closely monitor the humanitarian situation in Somalia. As the Deputy will be aware, the recent UN Inter-Agency Mission to Somalia concluded that the security situation in the country was not yet conducive to establishing a peace building programme at this time.

      <P>The Government of Rwanda is currently participating in the inter-Congolese dialogue which got under way in Sun City, South Africa, on 25 February.

      <P>Following a violation of the ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by the rebel group Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) on 15 March, the UN Security Council called on Rwanda to exert its influence on the RCD to withdraw from the areas it had occupied in contravention of the Lusaka Agreement.

Since the implementation of the agreement, much progress has been achieved. With the exception of some isolated incidents, Ethiopia and Eritrea have complied with their commitments under the Algiers Peace Agreement.</P>
      <P>Ireland continues to play an active role in the peace process, bilaterally and at the UN Security Council.</P>

      <P>Under the Algiers Agreement, the United Nations established a boundary commission to delimit and demarcate the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The boundary commission decision is due to be released in early April and its acceptance by both sides will be a crucial test of the peace process. In February 2002, Ireland took part in a Security Council visit to the region, and met with President Isayas in Asmara, as well as travelling to the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) to witness the work of UNMEE. The aim of the mission was to encourage confidence building measures and reconciliation between the two countries, as well as relaying to the parties the monumental importance attached to their acceptance of the boundary commission's determination. As such, the mission can be considered successful. The mission welcomed the commitment made by President Isayas to abide by the determination of the Boundary Commission. In March 2002, Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, visited our troops in Eritrea and took the opportunity to convey once again to President Isayas that the international community expects Eritrea to abide by the terms of the Algiers Agreement. President Isayas confirmed his earlier commitment to abide by the findings of the Boundary Commission.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Burmese people are ruled by a repressive military junta which has refused to recognise the results of the democratic 1990 elections. Under this regime, there has been a systematic abuse of the civil and political rights and fundamental freedoms of the Burmese people. Basic political rights have been curtailed, the offices of the opposition National League for Democracy closed and its members imprisoned, including its leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest in Rangoon since 1989. UN, EU and NGO reports confirm that political prisoners are held in sub-standard jail conditions. Minority ethnic groups, in particular, suffer systematic human rights abuses. The military is engaged in violent conflict with armed groups in many areas of the country and there are reports of serious violations of the rights of innocent civilians, particularly refugees, in these areas of conflict. Moreover, Burma is experiencing a high level of HIV infection.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in common with most EU countries and the majority of nations worldwide, does not have diplomatic relations with Burma. Over the past decade, the Government has been closely following developments in Burma, looking, in particular, for some sign of change in the military's attitude towards the restoration of democracy and respect for fundamental human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past year, there have been some positive developments. The military regime has released a number of political prisoners detained since the early 1990s. The offices of the National League for Democracy were re-opened and confidence building contacts were established between the military and Aung San Suu Kyi, under the auspices of the special envoy of the United Nations Secretary General for Burma, Mr. Razali. Contacts with the International Labour Organisation and the UN Commission on Human Rights were also resumed. Ceasefires were agreed with various ethnic armed groups. These developments, while welcome, do not represent concrete or irreversible developments <Col N="832" /> towards the restoration of democracy or national reconciliation. For this reason, pressure will be maintained on Burma on a number of fronts.</P>
    <P>On the human rights front, Ireland is co-sponsoring a strongly worded resolution on Burma at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The draft resolution strongly urges the Burmese Government to ensure full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms and goes on to list specific areas for concrete action, notably in relation to political rights, the rights of women and children and minorities, the protection of prisoners and refugees and labour rights. On the issue of forced labour, the ILO is considering further action against Burma following a disappointing visit by its team of monitors last month. During the visit, the military Government refused the ILO's request to establish a permanent presence in the country and refused access to Aung San Suu Kyi, despite a commitment by the military Government to eliminate all forms of forced labour in Burma.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General's special envoy to Burma, Mr. Razali, has regularly visited the country over the past year and has succeeded in bringing about a number of positive developments, not least the decision by the military Government to initiate contacts with Aung San Suu Kyi. Mr. Razali is currently seeking progress in three main areas, calling on the military to release 30 senior political prisoners, to create an amnesty for all political prisoners and to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to leave her residence and take up leadership of the NLD. Mr Razali's most recent visit, planned earlier this month, failed to go ahead. The Government hopes this visit will be reinstated as soon as possible, and that the Burmese military will continue to engage in meaningful dialogue with Mr. Razali.</P>
    <P>The European Union is actively engaged in monitoring the situation in Burma. In October 2001, in response to the first steps of progress taken by the Burmese military, the EU decided to relax some of its restrictions on the Burmese leadership and to contribute to the UN joint plan of action aimed at combating the spread of HIV and AIDS. In doing so, the EU made it clear to Burma that it would consider introducing further positive measures if there was real progress towards the restoration of democracy and national reconciliation. The EU clearly stated, however, that such measures could be reconsidered should there be any negative developments.</P>
    <P>A team of high level EU representatives recently visited Burma to assess the situation there. They met senior Burmese military leaders, as well as Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the NLD, other opposition groups, ethnic minorities, and NGOs. The team will report in the coming days and its recommendations will form the basis for discussion among EU Ministers next month on whether to extend the EU's common position, which currently places restrictions on <Col N="833" /> the Burmese leadership, for a further six months. Ireland will seek to extend the common position.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to pursuing wherever possible an improvement in the situation in Burma. The Government will continue to encourage the military junta to follow up the initial positive steps it took last year and to engage in further meaningful dialogue, aimed at the restoration of democracy, national reconciliation and an improvement in the human rights situation in Burma.</P>

      <P>Under the e-commerce measure of the national development plan, 31 submissions were received under the second call for proposals by the deadline of 19 October 2002. The submissions were independently evaluated and the results of the evaluation were finalised at the beginning of this year. On foot of the evaluation, a number of local authorities have been asked to enter procurement to establish firm prices for their proposals. Once procurement is completed, subject to satisfactory pricing, contracts will be offered for the projects. It is anticipated that this will take place over the next two months. The proposals involve the construction of metro area fibre-optic networks in 19 towns. No proposal was received in respect of Tralee. Networks in other towns are under discussion with the relevant local authorities. Arising from the Government strategy which I announced on 8 March, a second <Col N="834" /> phase of 48 additional towns will be pursued through a public private partnership model. Tralee is one of those towns.</P>

      <Quest>following the statement in Dáil Éireann on 21 March 2002 by a Minister of State in her Department concerning the provision of natural gas to Sligo, the cost of the pipeline to Sligo; the towns it will serve between Ballinconnick, County Mayo, and Sligo; and the timeframe for the completion of the gas line.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's decision to extend the gas transmission system to Sligo via Ballina from the proposed Mayo to Galway pipeline recognises that the extension would not be viable on the basis of anticipated gas demand and that considerable grant aid would be required. The provision of such grant aid raises issues relating to EU state aid and procurement rules. My Department has already been in touch with Commission officials on the matter. The right to construct the pipeline will be established in an open tendering process. The next step in moving the project forward involves carrying out detailed engineering and planning work in order to establish a firm estimate of the capital costs. As this work will also define the optimum pipeline routing, it is not possible to say which towns it will serve between the Galway and Sligo, other than to say that the pipeline routing would be the shortest and most economical path with due consideration for environmental factors and ground conditions.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that Bord Gáis is likely to tender for the project, it is necessary to have the planning and costings carried out independently of them. This task will be carried out by consultants to be engaged by my Department. Terms of reference for the task are being drawn up and the normal EU public procurement rules will apply. This phase should be completed by the end of the year and the Government will be able to make a decision on grant aid. It is only then that the full development of the project can be put out to tender. The tendering process and the remaining phases in pipeline projects of this scale, obtaining the necessary wayleaves and statutory consents and constructing and commissioning the pipeline usually take at least a further two years to complete.</P>

      <P>Units do not hold stocks of service medals and bars in stores. Service medals and bars are requisitioned retrospectively by 31 March each year, through brigade records and data management, for personnel entitled to these medals. When sanctioned, units draw medals and bars from brigade clothing stores for issuing to personnel who have the required satisfactory service. Medals are generally presented on a formal parade during annual training camps. I have been advised by the military authorities with regard to the three units specifically mentioned by the Deputy, that two, 8th infantry battalion and 10th infantry battalion, have submitted requisitions for medals for the period ending on 31 March 2002. The 5th cavalry squadron has personnel awaiting service medals or bars from 2000-01. Requisitions have been completed in respect of all these personnel and the service medals or bars are awaiting issue to brigade clothing stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that around 140 farmers supplied reactor animals to Henshaws in the last three weeks of business, while a further 60 to 70 had been issued cheques by the company for their reactors but had delayed cashing them in the period before closure. The farmers involved are mainly from counties Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The procedure for disposing of reactor animals under the TB and brucellosis disease eradication schemes operates on the basis that meat factories tender on a weekly basis for the slaughter of these animals and my Department selects the meat factories on the basis of the prices they offer for different types of animals. At all times the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer and therefore the contract for the salvage value is a matter between the farmer and the meat factory involved. My Department's responsibility is to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and to pay the appropriate compensation.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances where a factory goes out of business, such as has happened in the case in question, the recovery of any moneys due to losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between themselves and the company's liquidators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have given my views on the Tobin tax issue on several occasions, most recently in reply to Question No. 75 put down by himself on 24 October last.</P>
      <P>The issue of the Tobin tax was discussed at the informal Ecofin meeting at Liege on the 22 September 2001. The Belgian Presidency indicated that it wished to pursue the matter in the context of a general study to be carried out by the Commission on the issue of globalisation. However it would be fair to say that most Finance Ministers, myself included, continue to have reservations about the Tobin tax proposal, and believe that it is not clear that a further examination of the issue by the Commission would ensure that satisfactory answers would be given to the many real questions concerning the tax including: the difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax; its doubtful effect on short-term speculative capital movements; its conflict with the basic tenet of free capital movement in the EU; its disproportionate effect on small business and consumers; the probability that the tax would simply drive participants into other, non-taxable, alternatives; and the negative impact on liquidity in the foreign exchange market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, at a formal Ecofin meeting on 16 October 2001, it was agreed the Commission would carry out a study on globalisation and that <Col N="842" /> this study would examine the arguments for and against a Tobin tax. This study, Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation, was published on 14 February. On the matter of the Tobin tax, the study concluded that &ldquo;while as a source of additional revenue a currency transaction tax may look appealing, its feasibility is, however, not demonstrated&rdquo;. On the general point of international taxes, such as the Tobin tax, to fund international development, the study concluded, &ldquo;it seems that meeting needs for enhanced financing of development and for the provision of global public goods in the short to medium term will require more substantial contributions from national budgets and a further increase in the efficiency of resource use than is presently the case&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 147 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" />The production, issue and withdrawal of the euro banknotes fall within the responsibility of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). I am assured by the Central Bank of Ireland that the quality of the euro banknotes produced is consistent across all the euro area member states.</P>
    <P>I have received a letter from a member of the public about the condition of euro banknotes in circulation in Ireland, mentioning &euro;5 notes in particular. The Central Bank advises that while it has not received complaints, it has noticed that some &euro;5 notes in particular are already exhibiting signs of deterioration. This phenomenon, the bank says, is similar to the pattern observed with the quality of IR£5 banknotes: the average life of the IR£5 banknote was about five months. It is too early to estimate the length of the life of the &euro;5 banknote but it is unlikely to be much different from the IR£5 banknote, as the quality of the paper in both notes and the manufacturing processes used are virtually the same. The average life length of banknotes in Ireland has traditionally been much shorter than that of banknotes in other countries in the euro area. This seems to result from the way in which the banknotes are treated in circulation. In this context the Central Bank made an appeal to the public, shortly after the euro changeover began, to handle the new notes with care, including by carrying them in a wallet or some similar holder, and not to crumple their notes or fold them more than once. The Central Bank would repeat this appeal.</P>
    <P>In addition, the bank points out that there is a particular problem in relation to the lowest denomination notes because retailers require these as change and do not lodge them. This in turn makes it difficult for the bank to remove badly-deteriorated notes and replace them with new ones. I am advised that the Central Bank is examining ways in which the quality of the &euro;5 note circulation might be improved.</P>

However, there are provisions in Section 193 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, whereby income from a scholarship held by a person receiving full-time instruction at a university, college, school or other educational establishment is exempt from income tax. It may be that the income of the person in question is from a scholarship and not from a fellowship.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The one parent tax credit is intended as an assistance in respect of the financial burden involved where a lone parent, single, separated or widowed, has responsibility for dependent children. In those circumstances, married couples living together and cohabiting couples living together as man and wife are specifically excluded from the credit.</P>
      <P>A married couple is regarded as living together unless either (i) they are separated under a court of competent jurisdiction or by a deed of separation or (ii) they are in fact separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent.</P>
      <P>A married couple may be regarded as living together for tax purposes even though one of them is working abroad. However, the question is one to be decided on the facts in each individual case.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to change the relief, if the Deputy has a specific case in mind and the party involved is likely to be regarded as separated from her husband in accordance with (i) or (ii) above and therefore likely to be entitled to the one parent family tax credit, she should contact her local tax office to have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the Office of the Revenue Commissioners' rules and practices reference manual published under section 16 of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, sets out its practice in relation to the application of business relief for capital acquisitions tax purposes to caravan parks.</P>
      <P>In summary, business relief only applies to relevant business property. Section 127 of the Finance Act, 1994, sets out the definition of such property. The section specifically excludes investment assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" />The Revenue Commissioners' rules and practices reference manual states that, as a general guideline, where a business's own furnished caravans account for at least half of the total number of lettings, it would be appropriate to accept the business as primarily trading and therefore eligible for business relief.</P>
    <P>Conversely, where most of the lettings relate to pitch sites and facilities are restricted to the provision of basic facilities such as water and electricity, business relief would be denied on the grounds that the business is mainly engaged in the exploitation of its property rights as opposed to trading.</P>
    <P>The Revenue manual states that the availability of business relief will depend on the facts in each case and I am informed that if there are any specific cases, these can be submitted to Revenue for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>I introduced income tax relief for trade union subscriptions paid to specified trade unions in the Finance Act, 2001, for 2001 and subsequent years. Arising from the prior need to identify the qualifying trade union members in the most efficient way <Col N="846" /> possible, the tax relief for trade union subscriptions due in respect of the short tax year ended 31 December 2001 is, with the agreement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, carried forward for inclusion with the relief appropriate to the 2002 tax year.</P>
      <P>The annual amount of the relief for 2002 is &euro;130 at the standard rate of tax, which is equivalent to a tax credit of &euro;26. The relief available for 2001 is reduced proportionately for the short year of assessment to a tax credit of &euro;19, and this is carried forward to supplement the tax credit to be allowed in 2002. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where possible the tax credit for trade union subscriptions &ndash;&euro;45, comprising &euro;26 for 2002 plus &euro;19 for 2001 &ndash; was automatically included in the certificates of tax credits and standard cut-off point which issued earlier this year. Any individual, paying a trade union subscription, who has not yet received the tax credit in his or her certificate may claim the relief by contacting his or her local tax office or by telephoning the LoCall number 1890 60 50 90.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the delays being experienced by applicants for intercountry adoption assessment in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA. The number of applicants awaiting assessment in the ERHA at the end of 2001 is 477 for first assessment and 61 for second assessment. Delays have arisen in recent years because of an increased interest in intercountry adoption and difficulties being experienced by the South West Area Health Board &ndash; which to date has been providing this service on behalf of the three area boards &ndash; in recruiting social workers in the child care area, including intercountry adoption.</P>

    <P>The standardised framework for intercountry adoption assessment procedures is now being used in all health boards. The purpose is to streamline assessment processes for first and second assessments so that resources are used <Col N="849" /> effectively and to provide a transparent system that can be understood by all of the parties. The framework has been welcomed by both health boards and couples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal that the Deputy has furnished to me was previously presented to the Joint Committee on Health and Children by its author when that committee was examining the issue of the public orthodontic service. This proposal &ndash; that responsibility for the orthodontic services within my Department be moved from &ldquo;the Community Care section to the Hospital Care section&rdquo;, was not recommended in the report on the public orthodontic service by the joint committee.</P>
      <P>I recognise that there are problems in the orthodontic service and I have taken a number of important steps to increase the number of cases in orthodontic treatment. However, the contention that moving the administration of the orthodontic service from the community health division to secondary care is a panacea for such problems is, at the very least, unconvincing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996, my Department wrote to the chief executive officers of the health boards recommending that a group, representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists, review the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure an adequate and equitable provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. One of the key recommendations of this review group &ndash; known as the &ldquo;Moran Report&rdquo;&ndash; was that appropriately <Col N="852" /> trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the provision of a timely and high quality service.</P>
    <P>This was against the background of a consultant-led service that had developed in the mid 1980s. Within this service a number of dentists had worked in orthodontics under the direction and supervision of consultants with a view to achieving postgraduate qualifications in orthodontics. This informal training framework was inconsistent with the modernisation of dentistry under governing EU directives that led to the introduction of specialisation in dentistry in the 1990s. In effect, it became essential that specialist in orthodontics training programmes meet internationally recognised standards. Accordingly, with my consent the Dental Council established a specialist register with a division of orthodontics in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also be aware that in 1998 the then consultant orthodontist in the Eastern Health Board requested my Department to invite experts from the United Kingdom to validate a training programme for her staff. It is regrettable that the consultant subsequently refused to participate in the validation process. This sequence of events led to trainees leaving the orthodontic unit and applying elsewhere to seek specialist in orthodontics training.</P>
    <P>Agreement has been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. This agreement resulted from complex and time-consuming negotiations. The introduction of the specialist grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics. Other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service include new specialist in orthodontics training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist.</P>
    <P>Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North Eastern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;541,000 in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    <P>The Moran report also recommended that auxiliaries be employed in the regional orthodontic units. In order to enable the achievement of <Col N="853" /> greater caseloads, the Dental Council will shortly submit to my Department a draft scheme to recognise auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics. This grade &ndash; to be known as orthodontic therapist &ndash; will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff, develop new treatment facilities and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. My Department is exploring with boards every possibility to expand the level of services in the short-term such as the use of private specialist orthodontic practitioners and the treatment of patients in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year.</P>
    <P>The assertion by the author of the proposal submitted by the Deputy that fewer children are being treated now in the orthodontic service than in 1999 is at variance with treatment statistics furnished to my Department by the health boards. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in mid-1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <P>While this development is of concern it does not have any immediate implications for the delivery of obstetric services in Ireland. The clinical negligence scheme which is due to come into effect from 1 July 2002 provides for the change of existing arrangements for the provision of medical indemnity so that individual consultants who work in the public hospital system will not have to provide their own indemnity cover for their public work. This will remove the need for consultants to pay the amounts now being charged for indemnity cover even though the bulk of this cost is borne by the Exchequer by way of a 80% to 90% reimbursement for those who work in the public sector. To tackle the longer term issues in this area the group established to look at alternative ways of providing cover for infants who suffer brain damage at birth, including a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme, has had several meetings and is due to produce an interim report in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993, has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act, and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. There is no provision in the legislation for the payment of a subvention for a patient in a general public hospital. Nonetheless, if people in a public hospital wish to enter a private nursing home, it is open to them to apply for a subvention towards the cost of their care. Application forms are available from each health board.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

      <P>The pharmacy review group, which held its first meeting on 2 November 2001, was established to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland and it is now being asked to report as quickly as possible, in view of the revocation of the relevant regulations. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. I am considering a number of options pending the completion of the work of the group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, confers a right to retain possession, as a tenant, of a formerly rent controlled dwelling for the lifetime of the person who was the tenant at the commencement of the Act &ndash; 26 July 1982 &ndash; and for the lifetime of their spouse. Where a member or successor members of the tenant's family succeed to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to retain possession as a tenant under the 1982 Act continues to 25 July 2002, or until the tenancy has lasted a minimum of 5 years.</P>
      <P>Once protection for successor tenants ceases under the 1982 Act, I am advised that they may be entitled to claim a long equity lease of up to 35 years under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. If the landlord is unwilling to grant such a lease, the tenant may apply to the Circuit Court to determine a tenant's entitlement and also to set the rent and other tenancy terms in the absence of agreement between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acquisition of a long equity lease provides significant benefits for tenants. They acquire the right to retain possession of the dwelling and are subject to rent reviews at intervals of not less than <Col N="862" /> five years. The court, in determining the rent, has regard to market value but also takes into account the addition to the letting value of any improvement works carried out to the dwelling by the tenant.</P>
    <P>My main area of concern will be to avoid the creation of hardship for low income successor tenants moving from a position where rents are set by the rent tribunal &ndash; taking into account the means of the tenant and of the landlord &ndash; to a position where the rent approaches the levels applicable in the open market.</P>
    <P>Under the present terms of the special rent allowance scheme operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for tenants in this sector, entitlement to rent allowance ceases when protection under the 1982 Act ceases. Proposals for an appropriate form of means-related rent assistance in such cases are being prepared in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and it is intended to seek Government approval of these within the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 187 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past five years this Government has substantially increased the level of capital investment in the fire service with more than &euro;66 million <Col N="863" /> being provided in capital grants &ndash; more than was provided in the preceding ten years. This year's allocation is a record &euro;19.568 million and will ensure further significant progress in the development of the fire service infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 40 new fire appliances approved for delivery this year, fire authorities are being given approval to invite tenders during 2002 for the purchase of 32 further new fire appliances at a total cost of &euro;8 million. This brings to more than 130 the number of new appliances that I have approved since taking up office &ndash; almost half of the current front line appliance fleet nationally. This level of approval will further accelerate fire authorities' plans to replace older first response vehicles with up-to-date new type appliances and thereby significantly reduce the average age of fire brigade fleets.</P>
    <P>Over the years, fire authorities have purchased some previously owned appliances to meet the requirements and particular needs of their fire service e.g. for less busy stations or as specialist appliances, etc. My Department has provided grant assistance for many of these proposals and it is a condition of grant approval that fire authorities have to be satisfied that the appliances meet their operational requirements and represent value for money.</P>

    <P>In relation to funding for public library services generally, the implementation of the recommendations in the 1998 report on the public library services, Branching Out, is now well advanced. Progress made to date includes: a doubling of capital investment in library buildings. The multi-annual building programme put in place in 1999 was expanded last year and there are now projects <Col N="864" /> under construction or in planning which will attract grant-aid of over &euro;65 million; provision of funding for the installation of more than 1,400 Internet access points together with a centrally funded scheme of Internet training for library staff; provision of library stock grants totalling &euro;4.4 million in 1999-2001 with the result that average spending on book stock by library authorities has increased from &euro;1.61 <i>per capita</i> in 1998 to &euro;2.49 in 2001; introduction of improved financial assistance for the computerisation of management systems and the electronic delivery of library services; following a pilot project in six libraries to assist people with visual disabilities, plans to introduce PC based optical scanning facilities throughout the library network are well advanced; the launch of a major promotion of free library membership to all primary schoolchildren to promote better awareness of public library services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.</P>
      <P>On 23 January 2002, I received a report from a member of the public which made a number of serious allegations concerning, among other things, unauthorised waste activities involving or associated with a company that had received grant assistance from my Department under the EU co-funded Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no statutory function in the oversight or regulation of waste activities. However, in the circumstances of this case, and as an exceptional measure, I considered it appropriate that my Department should directly investigate the allegations in the said report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the request of the complainant, I also forwarded a copy of the report to the Criminal Assets Bureau, which in turn referred it to the <Col N="865" /> National Bureau of Criminal Investigation for consideration.</P>
    <P>An inspector of my Department visited the area in question on 6 and 7 February 2002 and interviewed relevant members of the public and officials of Louth County Council. He had a lengthy telephone discussion with the complainant, who indicated that he also possessed further evidence in support of this complaint, in addition to his report of 23 January 2002 which had been stated to be comprehensive.</P>
    <P>I have received a report of these investigations, and my Department has since made a number of recommendations to Louth County Council regarding further actions that should be considered by the council, having regard to the nature of the allegations concerned.</P>
    <P>On 11 March 2002, the inspector concerned wrote to the complainant, in response to faxes dated 7 and 15 February 2002, pointing out, among other things, that it had been and remained open to him to submit to my Department such further evidence or information as is in his possession. I am not aware that any such material has been provided in the interim.</P>

This requirement applies strictly to the payment of all housing grants by public authorities and cannot be waived in any individual case. An unsuccessful grant applicant might, in the circumstances presented, seek redress from the contractor. Details of the case might also be drawn to the attention of the semi-State body and of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

This provides, for the first time, a statutory right of public access to meetings of a local authority, subject to a restricted right of councils to meet &ldquo;in committee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have made regulations which permit public access as of right, also for the first time, to meetings of local authority committees, subject to certain exclusions.</P>
      <P>As indicated in replies to earlier questions, it is necessary for local authorities to have in place new standing orders to coincide with the coming into operation of these and other provisions of the new Local Government Act. Notes incorporating suggested standing orders have been issued to local authorities for assistance in relation to the commencement of these provisions.</P>
      <P>To allow time for elected councils to prepare for these changes and accept new standing orders, the time schedule for commencing the new provisions has been extended somewhat to 17 July 2002, which is fixed as the operative date by the commencement order already referred to. I have arranged for a copy of the relevant circular and accompanying documentation already issued to local authorities by my Department to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to <Col N="869" /> the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. Some &euro;4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002.</P>
    <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover 50% of the once-off cost of the purchase and-or installation of the necessary security equipment but grants of up to 90% maybe made where the circumstances so warrant.</P>
    <P>Any voluntary or community based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may apply for grant aid. Individual people who wish to obtain information on how they, or older people known to them, can obtain assistance under this scheme should contact their local representative of any of the organisations involved in the scheme, such as Muintir na Tire, Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, or any other group involved in the scheme in their local area. Alternatively, they may contact the relevant social welfare regional office for information on which local organisations may be involved in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The 2002 scheme of grants will be advertised extensively in the national and provincial newspapers in the near future. While a closing date for receipt of applications is applied each year, the regional offices of my Department are flexible in accepting late applications, their prime concern being the safety and security of vulnerable older people in the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, as amended by regulations last year, pregnant workers are entitled to 18 weeks unpaid leave from their employers. Employees can also qualify for an additional eight weeks leave, but since this does not attract any payment, I am only dealing with the 18 week period in this reply.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory obligation requiring the continuation of wages during the 18 weeks of maternity leave. Therefore, the question of payment by employers during such leave, as in the case of other types of leave, including sick leave, are matters for negotiation between the employers and employees involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, where a woman is entitled to <Col N="870" /> maternity leave and has sufficient PRSI contributions she may qualify for maternity benefit from my Department.</P>
    <P>While no comprehensive data is available, it is understood that most public sector employers and many of the larger private sector employers continue paying wages during maternity leave. In general, such employers pay the difference between the woman's normal wages and any maternity benefit payable.</P>
    <P>Weekly social insurance benefits are, in general, paid on a flat-rate basis and comprise a personal allowance, together with additions for qualified adults and children. For instance, the personal rate of the main social insurance payments for temporary periods of absence from the workforce, i.e. disability and unemployment benefit, is &euro;118.80 a week.</P>
    <P>However, the maternity benefit scheme differs from other weekly social welfare payments in that it is an earnings-related payment, but subject to a minimum and maximum payment. The purpose of this payment is to provide women with an adequate income during the maternity leave period.</P>
    <P>The level of maternity benefit is set at 70% of the woman's earnings in the relevant income tax year, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;135.60 a week and a maximum payment of &euro;232.40 a week. However, unlike other social welfare payments, maternity benefit is not taxable. In addition, if the employer does not pay any wages for the maternity leave period, then the woman will generally be entitled to an income tax refund for that period.</P>
    <P>If social insurance payments were to be made fully earnings-related then this would involve a substantial increase in expenditure on these schemes. This in turn would require a significant increase in the current levels of PRSI contribution payable in order to fund the additional costs involved. By way of illustration, the level of social insurance contributions payable in EU countries where the benefits provided are earnings-related, e.g. France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, range between 10% and 43% in the case of the employee contribution and between 20% and 45% in the case of the employer contribution. The equivalent social insurance contribution rates in this country are 4% in the case of employees and 10.75% in the case of employers.</P>
    <P>Any increases in the level of social welfare payments payable, including maternity benefit, are matters for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and in the light of the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203, 204 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>The surviving remains of Portumna Castle, garden and demesne are of unique national architectural and historical significance and the setting and extent of the national monument would be considered of international importance.</P>
      <P>The presentation and interpretation of these remains provides the &ldquo;additional possibility&rdquo; of developing the potential of the site as a cultural resource in terms of academic research, conservation skills training with local community involvement and tourism.</P>
      <P>Inaccurate or conjectural restoration would detract from the integrity of the national monument. Restoration of a number of elements of the castle &ndash; mainly the roof, main floors and front garden - was based on evidence gained from research and the study of surviving features.</P>
      <P>Due to the intensive fire of the 19th century very little remains of the elaborate interior finishes of the castle and consequently my Department is of the view that a full accurate restoration of Portumna Castle is not feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" />I should also re-iterate that &euro;3,948,263 has been spent to date at Portumna Castle and that there is an ongoing commitment to providing a visitor service at the site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership and I am not therefore, in a position to provide assistance for the restoration or repair of the steeple of St. John's Church, Nurney, County Carlow. However, one source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has the power to provide advice and assistance &ndash; including financial assistance &ndash; in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that as part of a package launched jointly by me and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, a grant scheme has been introduced for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities. All enquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant local authority, in this instance Carlow County Council.</P>
      <P>Finally, the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by the me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I am happy to furnish the Deputy with greater detail on changes to SAC boundaries made on foot of the appeal process as referred to in my earlier reply of 20 March.</P>
      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the following statistics relating to appeals that were completed up to Tuesday, 26 March. Out of a total of 384 appeals dealt with informally by Dúchas staff the cSAC boundary was amended in 200 cases. Most of these informal amendments involve 187 exclusions from the overall land contained within the designated site, but only 13 involve additions to the extent of land in cSACs.</P>
      <P>Out of a total of 86 appeals referred to the appeals advisory board, the cSAC boundary was amended in 39 cases. Of the balance of 47 cases, 13 were withdrawn by the appellant. Each of the amendments have involved exclusions from the overall land contained within the designated site.</P>

      <P>On 28 March 2001 the Deputy tabled Parliamentary Question No. 156 on the subject of golf course development in Kerry and Donegal and injunction proceedings to restrain such development which my Department sought and obtained. These injunctions were <Col N="874" /> sought on the grounds that any additional golf course development at the sites concerned would have an adverse impact on the favourable conservation status of the SAC in which they were located.</P>
      <P>In reference to the Kerry case it was stated, <i>inter alia</i>, in the written reply: &ldquo;The Deputy will also be aware that works had commenced, which constituted a &lsquo;notifiable action' under the Natural Habitats Regulations&rdquo;. This statement was based on a misapprehension of the situation by officials of my Department. In light of further clarification from the officials I accept that no work had in fact been done on the site in Kerry at that time.</P>
      <P>The interim injunction proceedings in the Kerry case were brought to full hearing in the High Court in the course of which the designated status of the site as a SAC under the EU Habitats Directive was challenged. The reserved judgment has been given but a court order has not yet been perfected. Therefore, the designated status of the site is affirmed by the court and a permanent injunction has not been granted.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management adopt a pro-active approach to activities such as gangs of youths congregating in residential areas, or engaging in anti-social behaviour and vandalism. Mobile foot patrols and public order units are directed to pay attention to areas where such activities prevail. Community policing units, in conjunction with Neighbourhood Watch schemes, <Col N="878" /> continue to work together to identify culprits and persistent offenders who are dealt with under current public order legislation. The recently launched Operation Encounter is proving very effective in curbing such activities.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January to date a total of six incidents have been logged at the Bridewell Garda station regarding stone throwing and acts of criminal damage in the general area of Sitric Road and surrounding streets. During the same period a total of three persons have been arrested for breaches of public order and committing criminal damage in this area.</P>
      <P>The complainant mentioned in the question has corresponded with the Bridewell gardaí by letter dated 15 March. He outlined problems relating to damage being done to his property.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the neighbourhood policing garda assigned to this area has, in addition to attending residents' meetings in the locality, called on the person in question on a number of occasions to discuss these matters. Furthermore, this area is patrolled regularly by the Garda who have interviewed and taken the names of a number of youths found congregating in the locality.</P>
      <P>Road contractors rubble located at the roadworks on Oxmanstown Road has contributed to the ongoing problems and been used as ammunition by youths in the area to break windows and commit criminal damage. Garda are endeavouring to have Dublin Corporation clear up the rubble and are liaising with the site foreman in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Garda attempted to establish a Neighbourhood Watch scheme in the area but did not get a good response from residents last December and the matter was deferred. New efforts in this respect will be made by the Garda in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>As part of the recently launched Operation Encounter, the patrol for the Manor Street area has been extended to specifically cover Sitric Road and the surrounding streets in this operation. I am assured that the gardaí at the Bridewell will continue to pay attention to this area in order to assist in resolving the current problems being experienced at this location.</P>

      <P>The total amounts paid out in each of the past four years by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal to applicants entitled to compensation is as follows: 1998 &ndash;&euro;3.834 million; 1999 &ndash;&euro;3.657 million; 2000 &ndash;&euro;3.329 million; and 2001 &ndash;&euro;2.951 million.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the amount payable in any year is dependent on the number of claims lodged and the number of claims which can be finalised in each year. In each of the years mentioned, all claims which had been finalised during the year were paid out.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme is being undertaken by my Department at present. It is intended that the review will be a comprehensive one, taking into account all relevant questions and situations. Submissions for proposed changes have been received from relevant organisations and these submissions are receiving consideration as part of the review. In addition, my Department is consulting compensation authorities in other jurisdictions in relation to the operation of criminal injuries compensation schemes to identify best practice in advance of making proposals in relation to the Irish scheme.</P>
      <P>I can also inform the Deputy that the European Commission has presented a Green Paper in relation to compensation to victims of crime. Discussions are ongoing with the Commission in relation to the proposals for change contained in this Green Paper.</P>
      <P>In relation to specific proposals for changes to the existing scheme, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be proper for me to make decisions in this regard in advance of receiving the report. While the scheme is a non-statutory one any proposals to change it, which may be recommended as part of the review, will require the approval of Government. A revised scheme will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>An allocation of &euro;190,000 was made to Carlow in late 1999 under the young peoples facilities and services fund. In late 2000 the development group for the YPFSF in Carlow made a submission to the national assessment committee of the fund for the development of a central youth facility for the town and for advice on how best to progress the project. They were informed that no additional funding would be available under the YPFSF outside of their original allocation. I subsequently met representatives from Carlow Regional Youth Service in early 2001 to discuss its proposal.</P>
      <P>The development group made a further submission to the NAC in April 2001 seeking permission to use some of the funding allocated to them to develop the necessary plans to secure planning permission for its proposed youth facility. Following a meeting between representatives of the development group and the NAC in May 2001, this proposal was approved and the decision was communicated to the Carlow development group.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of funding which his Department has made available to the Kildare library service to ensure proper facilities for literacy, computer and audio training in all of the libraries of the county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>My Department makes a grant available to each local authority on an annual basis to enable local authority librarians select, purchase, and deliver books to the primary schools in its area. The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each local authority area. Kildare County Council received &euro;58,577 from my Department in respect of this grant in 2001.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to provide a library service for the schools in its area. My Department has no involvement in the operation of this service. Nor does my Department have an involvement in providing libraries with facilities for literacy, computer and audio training. This is a matter for each local authority.</P>
      <P>However, in the implementation of Branching Out, the comprehensive review of public library policy that was published in October 1998, a working group was established in May 2000 to explore all of the issues relating to the schools library service. My Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, An Comhairle Leabharlanna and the library authorities are represented on the group. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to proper library facilities and resources. In this regard, in addition to the funding that my Department provides to local authorities on an annual basis, two grants have issued in recent years from my Department directly to primary and post primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of some &euro;1,269 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received &euro;4,025 each. The grant that was issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to &euro;3,174, while disadvantaged schools received &euro;6,755.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second grant was issued to all primary and post primary schools in December 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant, primary schools received a payment of &euro;9.78 per pupil, while a minimum grant of &euro;586.62 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or less. Post-primary schools also received &euro;9.78 per pupil, while a minimum grant of &euro;1,955.40 was paid to all schools with less than 200 recognised <Col N="887" /> pupils. At primary level the total value of these two grants was approximately &euro;9.78 million, while at second level the two grants amounted to &euro;6.60 million.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. In view of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. A building project at the school in question is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals at present to establish a school for profoundly deaf children in the Munster area. At present, there are three special schools catering for deaf pupils, two in Cabra, Dublin and one in Limerick. There are 11 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools, located in Ballymahon (1), Cootehill (1), Cork (3), Ennis (2), Galway (1), Geashill (1) and Tralee (2). In addition, there are four post primary schools located in Castleblaney, Dublin, Ennis and Tralee with special units catering for deaf pupils. Further provision for children with hearing impairment will continue to be made available by my Department in response to identified need.</P>
      <P>I recently established an Advisory Committee on the Education of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. The committee will review the adequacy of the current range of educational support services available to students with hearing impairment; identify and prioritise areas of services provision which require development or adjustment; and bring forward such proposals as are considered appropriate in order to ensure the development and delivery of an appropriate and effective education support service for students with hearing impairment. The work of the committee will make an important contribution to the future development of services for children with hearing impairment throughout the country, including the Munster area.</P>

      <P>A national training programme for special needs assistants is in the process of being designed. It is envisaged that this programme will commence on a pilot basis in the coming school year. The in-career development unit &ndash; ICDU &ndash; of my Department has requested Mary Immaculate College, Limerick and St. Angela's Training College, Sligo, to undertake this work.</P>
      <P>The design process has already begun. Mary Immaculate College has organised two training courses for special needs assistants. Further courses are planned in the near future. These courses form part of the design process and will inform and help shape the development of the training programme for special needs assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, and pending the introduction of a national programme of in-career development, the unit is funding as an exceptional matter, the course fee for special needs assistants attending training which is currently being offered by a private training school. The unit also <Col N="890" /> considers applications for funding from schools for courses on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>The location of venues for training purposes is a matter for the course organisers, having regard to suitability and availability. To date, special needs assistants have attended courses arranged in various venues including teacher training colleges and education centres.</P>

      <P>Part-time special needs assistants are contracted to deliver a specified number of hours service per week in the schools in which they are employed and are paid accordingly. The duration of the service provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual children in respect of whom the special needs assistant support is allocated.</P>
      <P>Special needs assistants employed on a part-time basis are paid at an hourly rate. Under current legislation 8% of total earnings is paid to each part-time special needs assistant in respect of holiday pay. At present, a total of 568 special needs assistants are employed on a part-time basis in the primary sector.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the vital role which special needs assistants play in the special education system. My Department has no plans at present to pay part-time special needs assistants through the summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of &euro;58,407,951, £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes (CE) come to <Col N="891" /> an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school sector. My Department will receive a total of &euro;40,631,618, £32 million in this school year.</P>
      <P>The grant has been increased to &euro;102, £80 per pupil with effect from January of this year. In line with the new arrangements, an amount of &euro;20,604 was lodged to the school's bank account recently towards the cost of ancillary services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the major new disadvantage programme, &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; which I launched in January 2001, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;. The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and is eligible to receive &euro;4,027 in respect of the current school year, towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned.</P>
      <P>Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the breaking the cycle pilot project, including the school in question, retain their entitlements under that scheme, and also receive extra funding. Under breaking the cycle, the school in question is benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil, a refund of the television licence fee, a grant of &euro;5,079 per annum for out of school activities and a grant of &euro;3,809 per annum for materials and equipment. The school is also participating in the support teacher project and benefits from the services of a support teacher who caters for pupils with disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviour. Any claims for extra allowances for teachers who are teaching in disadvantaged areas should be made to the teachers' conciliation council.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and <Col N="892" /> speech and language therapists. The Report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next fifteen years. In relation to speech and language therapy training places, the report recommended an annual increase of 75 training places over the previous level of 25 training places. I have recently sanctioned an increase of 75 in the number of places for the education and training of such speech and language professionals so that those most in need will have access to the therapists who will help them get the education they deserve. As an interim measure my Department and the Higher Education Authority agreed to increase the annual intake to the speech and language therapy course at the University of Dublin, Trinity College to 29 from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority to pursue the issues arising from the report.

      <P>I am aware of the child referred to by the Deputy. Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in that area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties which pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to progress this case further a questionnaire issued to the child's mother which has helped identify his educational needs and pro<Col N="893" /> vides my Department with her written permission to contact schools and NEPS on behalf of her child. The advice of my Department's Inspectorate is being sought in this case, and every effort is being made to find a suitable school placement. The advice of the national educational psychologist service was sought in this case and on their recommendation my Department sanctioned 10 hours per week home tuition for this child.</P>

As part of this examination, factors such as housing developments, current and projected enrolments, and <Col N="895" /> the current capacity of schools in the area are being considered.</P>
      <P>This examination is nearing completion and a decision will be then be made on how best to meet the long-term accommodation needs of each post-primary school, including the Mercy Secondary School, Mounthawk. The overall objective will be to ensure that, between them, the post-primary schools will have the capacity to cater for the anticipated number of students from the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the circumstances of the school referred to by the Deputy. This school is already benefiting under a number of schemes aimed at addressing educational disadvantage. However, there is no scheme providing child care workers in schools generally and accordingly, it is not possible at this stage to give any commitment in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the major new disadvantage programme, &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; which I launched last year, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; is being run over a three-year period and will cost some &euro;33 million with the allocation of over 200 teaching posts. The schools targeted under &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, retain their entitlements under that scheme, and also receive <Col N="896" /> extra funding. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school in question is benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school-community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;. The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and is eligible to receive supplementary capitation funding of &euro;1,658 in respect of the current school year, towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. This funding is in addition to the &euro;3,885 that the school received under the disadvantaged areas scheme. Schools categorised as urban in &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo; with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils, including the school in question, are being supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes, infants through second class and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is also included in the support teacher project since 1999 and shares the services of a support teacher with another school who works with pupils with disruptive, disturbed or withdrawn behaviour. The position of this school will fall for consideration again in the context of the further development of measures to address educational disadvantage generally.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>Phase two of a building project for St. Thomas and Scoil Áine Naofa, Esker, Lucan, County Dublin is part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 260 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of what local consultations may have preceded the decision by the Patrician Brothers and County Laois Vocational Education Committee to amalgamate their existing schools to form a new community college in Portlaoise. I am informed that, since the decision was announced by the trustees on 31 August last, there have been at least five meetings with representatives of parents and-or teaching staff, specifically to listen to their concerns.</P>
      <P>To my knowledge, the trustees of the Patrician College met both parent and staff representatives and Dr. Tom McCarthy, facilitator, also met both parties. I met a deputation of Patrician College parents and officials of my Department met with both parent and teacher representatives on three occasions, the last such meeting lasting more than three hours. In the circumstances, there has been full engagement with the school community in Ballyfin and they have been given many opportunities to express their views regarding the trustees' decision. In that regard, the parents' and teachers' representatives have made a formal submission to my Department which is under active consideration at present.</P>
      <P>Community colleges which arise from greenfield developments or amalgamations are given formal effect in articles of agreement between the parties to the new school. In this case, I understand that the articles have been signed by County Laois VEC only. I am unaware of the date of signature.</P>
