      <P>It is proposed to take No. 35, motion re Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Act, 2001 (Commencement) Order, 2002; No. 24<i>a</i>&ndash; Finance Bill, 2002 &ndash; allocation of time motion for select committee; 24<i>b</i>&ndash; Finance Bill, 2000 &ndash; Financial Resolutions; No. 56, Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001 <i>[Seanad]</i>&ndash; Second Stage (resumed), and No. 9, Civil Defence Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: Nos. 35, 24<i>a</i> and 24<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate and, in the case of 24<i>b</i>, Financial Resolutions, Nos. 1-32, shall be moved together and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair; the resumed Second Stage of No. 56 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m., and the sitting shall be suspended from 1.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. to facilitate an electronic voting demonstration for Members in the Dáil Chamber.</P>

      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House.

      <P>No, Sir. As has been indicated from these benches on a number of days during the past few weeks, we do not agree to guillotining Bills. If Members wish to contribute, they should be afforded that opportunity. As a matter of principle, we ask the Government to stop guillotining measures when there are days on which the House could sit.</P>
      <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 56 be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach about the conflict between what seems to be the Government's view on the constitutional position of the morning after pill and IUDs and that expressed by the Referendum Commission. He assured me the commission was wrong and the Government was right. The Minister for Health and Children indicated that he believed I was quoting the commission out of context. The Taoiseach is probably aware the commission has reaffirmed its position. It now states, on the basis of independent legal advice, there is no change in the constitutional status of the use of the IUD or morning after pill. As a consequence, who are we to believe &ndash; a Government which has failed to explain matters properly or an independent Referendum Commission acting on independent advice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of this debate the Fianna Fáil Party issued an explanatory leaflet on the issue of the referendum. On question No. 5, it stated: &ldquo;The use of emergency contraception&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not quote&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer to it. The use of emergency contraception such as the morning after pill or post coital IUD will be fully safeguarded. In view of the presented legal advice from the independent Referendum Commission which patently contradicts that view and given that the Government's Green Paper, paragraph 708, also raises the same fears in relation to this matter, as outlined in the Referendum Commission's advices yesterday, is it not a fact that the advice from the <Col N="355" /> Fianna Fáil Party is wrong? Will the Taoiseach acknowledge and admit this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday morning that my advice from the Attorney General was to the effect that the morning after pill was fully compatible with Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and did not in any way infringe on the personal right to life of the unborn accorded by the Article. The Government's strong and consistent legal advice is that the constitutional position of the morning after pill is not open to doubt that it is fully compatible with Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. The Irish Medicines Board has similar but independent strong legal advice. The acceptance or rejection of the referendum proposal will not change its constitutional law status. There is, therefore, no question of a current or future infringement of the civil law.</P>
      <P>It is the statutory issue concerning the criminal law, emergency contraception, which the Government is addressing. As Members will be aware, the criminal law on abortion in Ireland can be found in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. The matter is being challenged in another jurisdiction. Section 6 of the envisaged Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act repeals sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. This new Act replaces those sections with a definition of abortion which will prevent any case being made that the morning after pill will be termed an abortifacient or subject to criminal sanction.</P>
      <P>The fact that there is currently no civil or constitutional law in relation to the morning after pill will not be altered by the acceptance of the proposal in the forthcoming referendum. There has been some doubt as regards criminal law, but it has been acknowledged that the new law will ensure the use of the morning after pill will no longer come within the scope of criminal law. It is entirely correct, therefore, to say the amendment will clarify the legal status of the morning after pill; that is the view of a number of eminent people.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention another matter while I have the opportunity. It was said the other day in sensationalist reports that women haemorrhaging as a result of miscarriage would not receive medical care. I welcome the statement of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists, which supports the Government's approach to the twenty-fifth amendment of the Constitution and accompanying legislation.</P>

      <P>May I put it to the Taoiseach that the Referendum Commission is independent in the exercise of its functions and that its primary function is to independently inform the electorate as to the issues on which it will vote? The commission reaffirmed yesterday the statement it made on Tuesday which stated:</P>
      <P>Whether the current criminal law outlaws the morning after pill (and similar devices) is open to question. The present constitutional position of these devices is also open to doubt. However, the acceptance or rejection of the proposal will not change their constitutional status.</P>
      <P>That is what the Referendum Commission has to state, but the Taoiseach is taking an entirely different view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has to be resolved, as it is absolutely crucial to the decision that many people will make. It is especially crucial for women who are deciding how to vote. I call on the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House this afternoon to make a clear statement of his understanding of the issues. Will the Taoiseach agree to publish the Attorney General's advice on the matter, as it seems to contradict independent legal advice received by the Referendum Commission, according to a spokeswoman quoted in this morning's newspaper?</P>

      <P>When this issue was raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell on Tuesday's Order of Business the Tánaiste gave a commitment that the cases raised by him would not be appealed. The position taken by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, certainly breaches the spirit of the Tánaiste's undertaking, if not the fact of it. Will the Taoiseach clarify the contradiction between the position of the Minister for Health and Children and the assurance given by the Tánaiste on Tuesday?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Claimants under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, may either <Col N="359" /> accept an award or appeal it to the High Court. The decision is entirely a matter between claimants and their legal advisers, but only one option may be validly pursued. Three cases, in which claimants are seeking to increase their awards after accepting them and thereby waiving the right to appeal, are due to come before the High Court in mid-March. The claimants have also received compensation from the statutory compensation tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children is not bringing the cases to court; he is the respondent in the cases being taken by the claimants and their legal advisers in the High Court. In a case decided in December 1999 the High Court considered that it had no discretion to hear an appeal from a claimant who had accepted an award and waived the right to appeal when the time limit for such an action had expired. I am advised that the question of the jurisdiction of courts to hear appeals in similar circumstances was not addressed in High Court judgments delivered last Friday, 15 February.</P>

      <P>A committee of the House heard last week that a number of foreign workers who have been brought to this country are being exploited and not being paid the national minimum wage. The Department has rightly blacklisted those employers, but there is some legal doubt about its right to do so without appropriate legislation.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Connaughton.</P>
      <P>The Gas Act, 1976, as amended by the Gas (Amendment) Act, 2000, now comes before us in the form of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001. There has been much controversy in recent times about unequal infrastructure, provision of energy and attractiveness for the location of industry in different parts of the country. This city on the east coast has become a monstrosity. It soaks up the vast majority of funds under the NDP and the consequences, because of inadequate facilities, include loss of business, stress and pressure. This is detrimental in terms of people's quality of life and social well-being. Governments, especially this Government, are very good at general discussion but it is never followed through. Conviction and direct decisions are required to influence the problems of which I have spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as a former Minister for Tourism and Trade, there is no question that a supply of natural gas is a critical factor when a decision is being made about the location of an industry. It confers an industrial advantage and results in job opportunities. Since natural gas is attractive for industry as a stable power supply and every local authority should have a supply within its region. In the west, we laboured long under the delusion that we had no problems in this regard. However, a number of years ago the ESB admitted that we did not have the capacity within the power loops to attract major industry to the west. Now that the Corrib field has been determined to be commercially viable and this enormous national asset is being examined for possible exploitation through the planning process, together with the <Col N="371" /> possibility of exploitation of the Rockall field and other fields further west, it would make sense for the Government to have a focused and clear agenda in terms of possibilities for the new board and direction, in policy terms, from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a real asset, in speaking to potential industrialists abroad, to be able to say that there is a stable power supply. I know the Minister of State will agree that industries such as Allergan, Baxter Healthcare, Hollister, Coca-Cola and Abbotts, all of whom are major employers in the Mayo-Sligo region, should be able to plan now for the existence of a gas line by a certain date so that they can supply combined heat and power processes for their own plants and sell the remainder into the grid or supply the local town. That makes absolute sense.</P>
    <P>There is currently a hearing in Ballina about Mayo County Council's decision to grant planning permission to Enterprise Energy Ireland for the building of a gas terminal at Ballagelly South, Bellanaboy Bridge, Belmullet. In many ways this exercise is necessary from a democratic point of view. The question being examined at the moment has nothing to do with Dúchas or the EPA or the issuing of licences. It is about the decision of the council on physical structure. Bord Gáis, which is to construct the pipeline from Bellanaboy to Galway, has already completed its way leaves and its site clearance construction for the holding of pipes and has made legal arrangements with farmers about passage through their lands. It appears, in many ways, as though the exercise were just that. I hold no brief for those who have objected, but they have stated their views quite clearly. However, I strongly believe in the necessity of bringing gas ashore, harvesting it and harnessing it for the economic well-being of all our people.</P>
    <P>The Government should make a clear statement that it and the new commission will ensure under this Bill and under the direction of the Minister that a line will be supplied from Bellanaboy through Ballina and on to Sligo. We should able to say that the gas network will be as efficient and as prolific as the telephone or the ESB network. I understand that not every rural household can have a supply of natural gas, but it should be without question that local authorities be able to plan now for an expansion of the gas line through their towns so that roadworks can be co-ordinated to cater for gas ducts. Industrial agencies promoting Ireland abroad should be able to state with confidence that combined heat and power processes can be an integral part of any major industrial plan locating in the west.</P>
    <P>Under the relevant section Bord Gáis has been given approval in the last few weeks, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to spend &euro;305 million on the development of a second interconnector from Scotland. While this is necessary, it creates an impression of confusion. Will there be gas through Ballina and Sligo or not? It <Col N="372" /> appears that we can have Siberian gas on the east coast but we cannot have west of Ireland gas for west of Ireland industry. I do not believe that is the case and the Minister, in responding to this Bill, should make that absolutely clear. There is confusion about the issue. Industry in the west labours under great disadvantage. There has been no publication of the national spatial strategy or the national decentralisation programme, despite the fact that the mission statement of every Department mentions equal opportunity for development throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have here a letter from the managing director of a firm which employs 1,000 people in County Mayo. Last year that firm spent &euro;130,000 in product damage limitation and was obliged to invest heavily in technology and re-packaging formats. Its representatives travelled as far as Japan to explain to customers why products had been damaged. It had happened because of the poor and inadequate road surface on the N5, the main commercial artery for the province of Connacht. This is not strictly relevant to the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001, but it is one of the disadvantages suffered by industry in the west.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify these issues in his reply. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources has said on two or three occasions that there will be a gas line through Ballina to Sligo, yet the spokesperson for Bord Gáis has said that this is not so because the board must first examine all aspects of the proposal, including economic issues. I understand that. Under the Gas Act, 1976 the Government is entitled to set down conditions. Will the Government see to it that gas is provided for the towns on the line through Ballina to Sligo? They should not be left wondering whether they will be connected to the national grid or not.</P>
    <P>Under section 9(4) of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001 the holder of a consent for the construction of an upstream pipeline, a line from the source on, has to take into account &ldquo;all reasonable steps to prevent injury to any building, site, flora, fauna, feature or other thing which is of particular architectural, historic, archaeological, geological or natural interest,&rdquo;. I assume that Enterprise Energy Ireland will be committed to that when the line develops.</P>
    <P>Recently I made the case in the House that the discharge pipe from the terminal at Bellanaboy should go further out than the six kilometres west of Glengad Head as proposed. Fishermen have a valid point. This line will be there a long time and, however clean the discharge into the bay, there will be trace elements in it. Over time that is bound to affect the juvenile fish population and stock. We should listen to the fishermen and if the pipe cannot be put out as far as the well head it should at least be put out further than planned at present. This issue needs decisive Government action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill, the basis for <Col N="373" /> which is the introduction of an independent regulator for the national gas sector. At present matters are regulated under the aegis of the Minister for Public Enterprise. I cast no aspersions on the Department but with new competition rules it is important to have an independent regulator.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis is one of our best companies. It works efficiently and the hallmark of that efficiency is that it has laid hundreds of miles pipeline without causing the problems other service providers seem to create. Bord Gáis seems to deal well with landowners and has had no particular problems in laying pipes through farmlands and towns.</P>
      <P>Now that there is a huge reservoir of gas off the west coast, the west will have access to gas for the first time. I raised the access issue with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources on a number of occasions. With this Bill, we want to ensure there will be no deviation from the promise of access to gas for towns in the west. Gas is a clean, efficient fuel. The new line will be built from Dublin to Galway and then connected with the Mayo coast. That will only connect the Mayo find to the national grid but will be of little use to towns like Tuam, Claremorris, Sligo and Letterkenny unless local lines are interconnected. This is our only chance to bring gas to the remoter areas of the west.</P>
      <P>The BMW region is being promoted world-wide for industry and 50% of foreign based industrial jobs are to be channelled to the west. I doubt that will happen but it is Government policy. A main attraction for any industry coming to the west is access to natural gas. Until now it was not available but it will shortly flow through the pipeline. Irrespective of what the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, said in the Dáil, I want a clear indication from Bord Gáis and the Government that this gas will flow through the towns I mentioned in the west and north-west.</P>
      <P>This gas find will create competition in the energy field. We have had too many monopolies in this country. Until recently, only the ESB provided electricity, only Bord Gáis provided gas, a telephone call could only be made through Telecom Éireann, a person could only take a train with Iarnród Éireann and, until private bus companies came on the scene, a person had to travel with Bus Éireann. The result was that the price to the customer was higher than it should be. European Union competition laws brought external pressure on us to change and we had to introduce competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must use this gas find to ensure we become competitive. Energy is an important aspect of all industrial development and this find is a lifesaver for the west in terms of job creation. It is important to write into the preamble to the Bill that the towns and villages of the west get gas as of right. We do not want to hear mention of social clauses. Some people would say that because a person lives in the west, he is not entitled to what a person living in Dublin would get. I do not want <Col N="374" /> to hear that. The only way to build sustainable, vibrant communities is to get people back to work and the only way to do that is to encourage the best and brightest to create jobs. Energy and natural gas are vitally important if we are to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ring, by agreement. I welcome the opportunity to speak and wish the Minister well. Some time ago, I tabled a question to the Minister regarding the extension of the gas pipeline to Longford and the surrounding region. In reply, he told me it was a matter for Bord Gáis to decide based on commercial criteria, that Bord Gáis was carrying out an assessment but that, at that time, it did not feel Longford would be included in its overall plans. That was like taking down a gun and shooting everybody in that region.</P>
      <P>We have heard from the Government about its interest in advancing industry in the BMW region. We have been told it is the policy of Enterprise Ireland and of all State agencies to advance the prospects of industry, commerce and the economy of those areas. This is a golden opportunity. Is the Government serious about this? It appears not. It is a major disappointment to me, as a Deputy for that region, that this Government has let the people down. The Taoiseach is to visit the area next week. I put down a marker and say to him that if he does not have plans to bring natural gas to Longford and the surrounding region, he is in for a bit of a roasting.</P>
      <P>In the past two days, I have spent two hours meeting various people involved in industry, including the largest employer in that area. That employer told me that if gas is not available and infrastructure not in place that region is going nowhere. I cannot understand how a Government that proposes to spend &euro;1 billion on a sports complex, which every expert and every independent opinion has called a waste of public funds, can justify not putting infrastructure into the midlands under the natural gas programme. I want to hear from the Minister, as a Member of the Government, that the advancement of infrastructure in that region is an important policy of this Government. I give a commitment to this House and to the people that I represent that such a policy will be my first call on a new Government.</P>
      <P>Through the years, the Fianna Fáil party has been quick to tell us that it was the party that brought energy and industry to the various regions. It was my party, Fine Gael, that advanced the ESB. When that power was brought to every corner of Ireland, it was approved by all and sundry. The advancement of the ESB gave domestic, industrial and commercial power. Such an opportunity exists again. Never before has any Government had the opportunities this Government has had. Whether this Government is re-elected or not, it is well-known that it has squandered the past four years and many opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Government not to waste this opportunity and to stand by its word and commit<Col N="375" /> ment. It should not let down the people of Longford and the surrounding area. The Government must bring the pipeline, the infrastructure and the energy to that area so that the area can be sold and people can be enticed to come in. If the power and energy are not there, industry will not come in. I hope, when the Taoiseach comes to Longford next week he will be in a position to give a clear commitment to the people that he will ensure that Bord Gáis will include Longford in its overall infrastructure plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. A number of years ago, when the Corrib gas field was first heard of, the people of the west were delighted. They said this was the first time since the foundation of the State that the west would get its fair share from the national cake, and that it would get the infrastructure, roads, industry and jobs that the region badly wants. That belief only lasted a short time. People then realised this was not all it was supposed to be. They then learned that Enterprise Oil had done a deal with the Government. The then Minister, former Deputy Ray Burke, tied up the negotiations and this country was sold short in relation to the money that will come to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Many people are now complaining that local people in north Mayo are objecting to this gas coming ashore. The people of north Mayo are not objecting to the gas coming ashore; they are objecting to the gas terminal coming to Ballinboy in north Mayo. This is the first time a gas company is bringing gas on to the mainland. We must be fair to those people who must fight the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The money spent by those Departments is taxpayers' money so that we now have a situation where taxpayers' money is being used to fight taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The reason local people are upset and are objecting to this building in Ballinboy is best highlighted by some examples. One example is that of a young man who lives within a couple of metres of where this building is to be built. He owns 40 acres of land approved by Mayo County Council for planning permission, but he is not allowed to build. The local doctor was trying to build six old folks' homes for the people of that area in need of accommodation but he also was refused by Mayo County Council. However, the multinational company, Enterprise Oil, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and Mayo County Council together saw fit to grant planning permission for this terminal when they would not do so for local people born and reared in the area, and who had lived there all their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in politics for 21 years this year yet I never knew of a State agency &ndash; I am talking about the Department of the Marine and Natural <Col N="376" /> Resources &ndash; that wrote to a local authority to ask it to let the agency know before planning permission was granted whether it would be granted. I will quote from a letter sent from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to Mayo County Council, reference AA05/01, which reads: &ldquo;In this context, the Department is seeking your co-operation and would appreciate if you would inform us in advance of any approval being given for this development&rdquo;. The letter is signed by an official in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>The Mayo county manager then wrote on the letter the words: &ldquo;Please ensure that the information required by the Department of the Marine request is complied with.&rdquo;  Is that not interfering with the planning process? The local people must fight the State with their own resources, their own time and their own effort. These people are not objecting for the sake of it or because they are opposed to gas. They are doing so in an attempt to protect their environment, their livelihoods in tourism and fisheries and the future of the area. They will get nothing from the State. The State will not gain one penny from this which is the daft thing about this gas find. Enterprise Oil, a private company, will make something like £800 million out of this. The taxpayers will not gain one penny and the people of the west will not gain anything. These rights are being sold for nothing. What is upsetting and annoying about all this is that these local people have to fight for their rights and have to fight the State, be it the Department of the Marine and Natural Resource or otherwise. What is happening is wrong. I support the residents 100% and make no apology for so doing. I support the gas but also support the residents. I see nothing wrong with bringing that gas in from the sea as was done in Kinsale and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have spoken about the gas going to Longford. I would like to see it going to Longford, which is in the BMW area, but it will be the greatest national scandal if this gas is taken out of north Mayo and if the people of Mayo do not benefit from it. It is planned to take it to Galway, Northern Ireland and to Scotland but the towns in Mayo will not get gas. They might get it in the second phase but the Minister of State and I are long enough around to know that if they do not get it on the first day, they will never see it. The daft thing is that investors all over the world &ndash; in Dublin, London, South Africa and elsewhere &ndash; will make millions upon millions of pounds. Bord Gáis has been given the responsibility for taking the gas out and Mr. and Mrs. taxpayer will pay for that. If we want a connection to Westport, Ballina and Longford, the taxpayer will pay for it.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight something that happened recently which will be of interest to football followers. Arsenal Football Club decided to relocate in London. It had to apply for planning permission and it went through the process. The club was granted permission but part of the deal was <Col N="377" /> that it would spend £300 million on the local community now, not when the club is up and running. It has now outlined to all the different agencies what it will spend. The Government has sold the taxpayer and the country short in relation to these rights. If the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is so interested in the planning process, in helping Enterprise Oil and in making sure these guys make plenty of money, why can it not put a condition on whatever support it is giving Enterprise Oil that it would give £300 million to the people of north Mayo to spend on roads, infrastructure, water schemes, hospitals and schools? It should say, &ldquo;Right, we may not be able to give you the gas, but we will give you something in return&rdquo;, but instead it would prefer the people of north Mayo to take all the disadvantages and the abuse with nothing in return. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>Why did the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources interfere with the planning process in this country? I hope fair play will apply to the residents of north Mayo when they appeal, that An Bord Pleanála will see they were not properly treated and will make the correct decision. How dare people condemn the people of north Mayo when they do not know what is happening. These are not unreasonable people; they are decent, honourable people fighting for their children, their rights and their area as they are fully entitled to do.</P>
    <P>Recently the local radio station did a programme on the planning process for the gas field. I think it was called &ldquo;Deficiency in Democracy&rdquo;. I compliment the local radio station because it went through the process stage by stage and showed what was happening &ndash; big brother taking on the small people of the west. Please God, if there is any justice, it will be shown that these people are doing the right thing and should not be condemned by people who do not know what is happening.</P>
    <P>It is a great scandal that we sold our rights. The taxpayer and the country will not gain anything. As a result of a certain Minister, some lord in Dublin, London or South Africa will probably take all the profits and laugh at the people of Ireland. There will be a tribunal some day in relation to this gas, the way the rights were sold and the way the planning process was dealt with. It will be called, the north Mayo Corrib gas field tribunal. We will get to the truth of what went on. I am in favour of the gas as are the people of north Mayo but people do not like being abused by the system. State agencies, taxpayers' money and the lawyers paid for by the taxpayers should not be used against the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Let us call a spade a spade. We want to see the people of this country getting something from this gas. When representatives of Bord Gáis came to meet Mayo County Council, I left that meeting in protest because I had to listen to a State agency giving a State view and telling us why we could not and should not get the gas. It said we did not have enough users and consumers to justify the <Col N="378" /> gas. When I left that meeting a lot of members of my party, present and former politicians, gave out about me but now they realise I was right. They now realise that the big guys will gain but the west will not.</P>
    <P>For 50 years, the west has suffered as a result of deficiencies in infrastructure. Every other place in the country has a national primary road to this city. As Deputy Kenny said, we have few jobs in the west. Companies are now complaining that when they bring their goods from the west to Dublin or elsewhere, they are damaged as a result of problems with the roads and infrastructure. Many people in the west do not have running water in their houses or access to proper sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>The planning process is supposed to apply to the whole country. Why is it that in Bellanaboy local people cannot getting planning permission but Enterprise Oil can with the assistance of the county council, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and Dúchas? Dúchas objects to every young person seeking planning permission in County Mayo and in the west, yet it did not see fit to make an observation, an objection or submission in relation to this big gas terminal in Bellanaboy. People who apply to Mayo County Council for planning permission are aware of the location of the SACs and NHAs. On this occasion, somebody said, &ldquo;Keep your mouth shut.&rdquo;  Shame on them, the Department and the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are people in north Mayo who have suffered over the years and have lost family members at sea. They have worked hard to build up little businesses such as lobster and salmon businesses. Instead of going out and taking on the Spaniards, the Dutch and others, the fisheries and patrol boats spent their time down in north Mayo following the poor the little fellow who might have spent an hour longer fishing than he should have or who might have had left the nets out for an extra hour. By God, when they want to use the resources of the State against them, they do so in this way and through the planning process. Shame on the politicians, particularly those on the Government side, who allow this Government to take a natural resource from north Mayo while the people of the west gain nothing from it. Shame on us all, we will have to answer to somebody for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. Gas is a very important means of power and support for this country. We are very fortunate to have discovered it off Kinsale and now in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals specifically with how gas will be piped through the various land structures and dis<Col N="379" /> tributed. It is important to recognise the good relationship between the gas installers and landowners in this regard. It took a long time for the NRA, which is trying to blame farmers for the delay in the construction of bypasses, to enter such an agreement with farmers.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed that it is proposed to bring the gas from north Mayo down the coast to Galway and across the midlands. Once again, the northeast and Border region is being ignored. The obvious route would be to pipe the gas through Leitrim and Cavan into Monaghan and then join up with the Northern Ireland pipeline. Instead, through whatever pressure or power, this pipeline is to be constructed along the west coast and across into the midlands leaving many areas without supply. That is unacceptable. Monaghan, which I represent, has a 100 mile border with Northern Ireland and has suffered more than most over the last 35 years as a result of the Troubles. Monaghan was to receive a peace dividend as a result of the British-Irish Agreement and the ceasefires. What have we got? We still have no indication that the pipeline will run through Clones &ndash; one of the most hard-hit towns in the country which was completely cut off from its hinterland &ndash; Monaghan, Ballybay or Castleblayney. There is a small link, through Kingscourt, with Carrickmacross and Lough Egish Food Park but the remainder of the county is left wide open with no support of any kind.</P>
    <P>Gas is a natural resource. Deputy Ring spoke of what he felt this should mean for the west. I believe it should benefit all areas not just the west. Handing over this project to private companies who have no interest in the well-being of rural areas is dangerous. Piped gas should be available to all. When electricity was being distributed throughout Ireland in the 1950s, every person received it at the same cost. People may have had to wait some time for a telephone service &ndash; I had to wait three years for my line &ndash; but when they got it, they did so at the same cost as everybody else. However, in this situation isolated areas may never receive piped natural gas. The Government must intervene to ensure all areas are treated equally and are given the same opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Government said it will give 50% of all IDA created jobs to the BMW region. They may give them to Galway and Athlone but is Monaghan, especially north Monaghan, not entitled to some of these jobs? How can we compete with areas that have good roads, railroads, broadband and natural gas? The Government promised a great deal five years ago. However, its promises are becoming very hollow at this stage. It is now proposed to remove the accident and emergency unit from Monaghan General Hospital, which is a further downgrading of services in that area.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to intervene at this late stage to ensure the gas pipeline from north Mayo is brought through the Border region <Col N="380" /> thereby giving service to areas most severely hit by the Troubles.</P>
    <P>Monaghan town has witnessed the closure of Pattons Mill, one of the most renowned feedmills in the country. Two thirds of Ireland's poultry was produced there yet the mill was closed. The swimming pool, which could have benefited from natural gas, was also closed. St. Patrick's Agricultural College has been closed with no effort being made to re-open it as a third level college. Monaghan Poultry has also closed. Natural gas would be extremely beneficial to anyone wishing to re-open that plant. The bakery, the jeans factory and Monaghan maternity unit have also closed. Monaghan has suffered more than most &ndash; I cannot repeat that often enough &ndash; as a direct result of the situation in Northern Ireland. Like Dublin, it is famous for all the wrong reasons, namely, the Monaghan-Dublin bombings. The onus is on the Minister of State and others to ensure Monaghan receives justice. That is all we are looking for; we are not looking for hand-outs. It is impossible to explain how the shortest way of joining a pipeline with Northern Ireland is to go south, cross the midlands and go up again. Surely a decision could have been taken to bring the pipeline from north Mayo across into the Border region.</P>
    <P>This Government will be judged not on what it has done but on what it has not done. The Government should and must ensure that the British-Irish Agreement and all it entails works not just for the island of Ireland, not just for Dublin and Belfast but for the Border region also. One of the major cross-Border bodies is located in Cork. Perhaps it was a recognition of the fact that Monaghan did not have gas, roads, railroads or the services required to service that organisation. It was a chicken and egg situation. If we do not provide the services we will not get decentralisation and multinational companies will not locate in Monaghan. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, promised that if people in Monaghan wished to set up broadband they would receive the necessary grant aid to do so. As yet, there is no indication of that happening.</P>
    <P>I do not like to be negative. I have tried to work with Government to the benefit of my constituents, to try to lift them from the mire they are in through no fault of their own. Clones is cut off. There is a meat factory that is doing well and the food industry is growing in the town. Are those industries to be put at a disadvantage because they cannot get natural gas? Is the town to be impeded? Is the new school not entitled to clean heating? Laws are being introduced to prevent the use of ordinary coal and all coal may eventually be banned. What will the costs be for those who live outside areas where natural gas is available? The Minister must reconsider the situation.</P>
    <P>The Government has influence over big industry. Deputy Ring spoke of the efforts to help with planning matters. At this late stage, a genuine effort should be made to make sure that the areas <Col N="381" /> that are most isolated are recognised and given the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>A person cannot fart here but someone will object. It is an objectionable activity but it begs the question does natural gas stink? Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us in his reply.</P>
      <P>When the curtain comes down in a few weeks time, I will retire from the Dáil. In moments of madness, however, I am tempted to run again as an anti-protest candidate. Every day of the week someone protests about this, that or the other and it really gets under my skin when I see how ridiculous some people can be. I have no objection to the introduction of natural gas to Ballyglass, County Mayo. It may lead to the Erris peninsula becoming a hub of industrial activity, creating jobs for the western seaboard. Surely we want to see that, not mass emigration from the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell the House the dimensions and projected life-span of the Corrib gas field and the remaining life-span of the Kinsale gas field. We have been told over the years that it is virtually exhausted but then renewed estimates tell us that it will be able to supply the needs of the State for a further year or two. There should be an accurate assessment. Does the Minister have such an assessment? What other fields are potentially commercially viable? Is the Helvick field viable in terms and what other pockets of oil or gas exist around the Irish coast? The Minister of State would do the House a service today if he would answer those questions instead of our having to table parliamentary questions about each specific item. Will he do that? He has been struck dumb ever since his appearance on the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo;, he does not even nod now. That is a good policy &ndash; keep the head down when in trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like an assessment of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more natural gas we have the better. We are all aware of our lack of natural resources and the impact that has on our economic progress. There is no coal or oil in Ireland. When anyone suggests a wind farm, however, particularly in the west, there is an avalanche of objections. I support the Government in its plans to provide more power through the use of wind farms The House was told that wind farms could meet 30% of all our electricity needs. On a windswept island like this, we should be in a position to provide 100% of our energy needs from wind power. Flying over Holland or Denmark, dozens of wind farms are visible. They get great benefit from this cheap energy source. We have an even greater capacity for wind generated energy because of our proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. Every effort should be made to encourage people to provide wind <Col N="382" /> farms and the objectors should be faced down wherever possible.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy with those who object to gas being brought in from the Corrib field through the west coast. Likewise, I have no sympathy for those who object to wind farms. I sympathise with those who object to pylons &ndash; there are dangers where electricity is concerned, particularly the electromagnetic fields that surround high tension cables. I also have limited sympathy for those who object to masts, which are often just antennae similar to television or radio aerials.</P>
    <P>Natural gas use will benefit the community but it will encourage the production of more greenhouse gases so it is not welcome in that regard. The less oil, coal, turf, timber and gas that we burn, the better. We should attempt to reduce the emission levels for this country and the way to do that is by using wind power.</P>
    <P>There should be a national strategy to become self sufficient in electricity &ndash; 30% is not good enough. The maximum we can hope for from hydro-electric schemes would be another 10%, but we should aim for 100%. We have the wherewithal at our disposal and we should use it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal for a major wind farm on the Arklow bank of the Minister of State's constituency. We are fortunate that Deputy Timmins has been promoting such projects for County Wicklow, be it the wind farm off the county's coast or the completion of the <i>Jeanie Johnston </i>project.</P>
    <P>That project was foisted on the people of Tralee, County Kerry where there is no shipbuilding tradition. There is such a tradition in Arklow where, as Deputy Timmins rightly pointed out, the ship should have been built and should be completed.</P>

      <P>A power plant project in Dungarvan, which will use natural gas, is awaiting a decision by An Bord Pleanála. I hope the objection will be overruled. In the interim, until we have a sufficient number of wind farms, natural gas will provide the best option for making up the shortfall in our electricity supply. The ESB is having tremendous problems in satisfying prospective industrialists who wish to locate here, because it cannot provide sufficient power supplies. That is the case in Waterford's Belview industrial estate. Industries which want to consume large amounts of electricity are being referred elsewhere because the power supply is insufficient. The Minister of State should address that disgraceful situation in his reply. What will the Corrib gas field do in this regard? Will it provide self-sufficiency? Will it encourage people who wish to start up heavy industry to come to Ireland, or will they be told that we still do not have sufficient electricity? I would like to know the answer because that matter has been swept under the carpet. Apparently, we do not have sufficient electricity to service industry, in particular, heavy industry.</P>

I do not want to go over the same matter again, but his fear about the supply of electricity into Dungarvan echoes mine about Sligo. It has been stated publicly on numerous occasions that the 220 kV line is unable to carry sufficient power supplies to Sligo town and on to County Donegal. The ESB is seeking to upgrade that supply. We have also been told that the lack of an upgraded electricity supply is one of the reasons Sligo town, as well as parts of counties Leitrim and Donegal, have not received the major boost in employment that other areas have enjoyed about which there is a concern.</P>

      <P>The issue of natural gas has been bandied around the constituencies of Connacht-Ulster for a number of years, ever the since the announcement of the Corrib gas field. There are local objections to the project on the Erris Peninsula, but the overview is that this will be of tremendous benefit to the country. I fully support the legislation before the House which is necessary to ensure a natural gas supply for the west coast with the necessary infrastructure. In my capacity as Fine Gael spokesperson on western and regional development, I have visited the Erris Peninsula which has suffered from a lack of job creation and infrastructure over the past 70 years. With Corrib gas field supplies coming onshore <Col N="385" /> there, the existing infrastructure will have to be upgraded. The development of the gas field should bring much needed employment to the area, including parts of the constituency I represent. I hope the gas supplies will be brought ashore as quickly as possible and that this will play a major role in halting the emigration of young people.</P>
      <P>Much information has been provided in recent years about the gas field and it takes time for such matters to be developed. I am hopeful that when the Bill is enacted the Government will be in a position to move forward apace. The biggest issue in the west is where the pipeline will go and what towns will be provided for, about which the Government has made numerous announcements.</P>
      <P>In his reply the Minister of State should outline where over the next five to ten years he envisages the gas pipeline being laid. In the local media I have heard Government Deputies stating the pipeline will eventually go to every small town and hamlet in the west and north west. That surprises me greatly because I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions to the Minister and have always received the response that the situation is under review. The Minister of State says that Bord Gáis wishes to extend the gas pipeline to Sligo, but a cost analysis must be undertaken and numerous other obstacles overcome before that will happen. On a local radio programme I heard that the pipeline would go to Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton, Letterkenny and most towns and villages in County Donegal and Sligo, which was news to me. The impression was that it would happen in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was on a local radio programme with the Minister, Deputy Fahey, and Deputy Ruairí Quinn last week when other issues were debated and when Deputy Fahey found himself in hot water. He gave a commitment that regardless of price the natural gas pipeline would go to Sligo and it would certainly run from Ballina to Sligo. I welcome that decision but I ask the Minister of State to clarify when it will happen, be it next year or in three, five or ten years time. My information is that it will be in the longterm because other areas have been prioritised already by Bord Gáis. I do not understand how a Government decision stating categorically that the gas pipeline will be going to Sligo can be made without the money being provided. A future Government could decide otherwise. It is imperative for the development of the north west and the western region in general that natural gas be brought into the area. The Western Development Commission has published some alarming statistics in its report on the state of the west. It is noted that only 7.8% of Leitrim third level graduates and 12% of Sligo graduates find employment in their native county and 48% of Leitrim graduates and 43% of Sligo graduates find their first job in Dublin. That is a huge brain drain from the north west and it is happening because we do not have the necessary infrastructure to provide jobs in the area. The development of the natural gas pipeline <Col N="386" /> is vital to job creation in the west. I ask the Minister of State to provide some concrete information regarding the timeframe and the security of the Government decision. While I welcome the Bill I ask the Minister of State to say how licences will be granted and what companies have declared an interest in becoming involved. Will the Minister of State say whether the necessary planning permission to lay the pipeline is being applied for and whether compulsory purchase acquisitions of land will be required? I would be grateful for a response to those questions. I welcome the legislation and hope the Bill will be passed as quickly as possible so that the Corrib field gas supplies can be brought ashore and delivered to the west and the midlands as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of this Bill. I hope that this Bill will not facilitate the great western robbery. Natural resources are scarce in the west. The products of the fishing and forestry industries have traditionally been brought elsewhere for processing and finishing. Natural gas is another western natural resource and I am pleased that it will be brought ashore in County Mayo and distributed from there throughout the west. This House should not facilitate a robbery of this gas from the west without any of its benefits accruing to the west.</P>
      <P>The west has a great energy deficit. The Department, local authorities and regional bodies have all indicated the need to redress that imbalance. This Bill is another opportunity to utilise a natural resource to the advantage of the area where it reaches land. The designation of the BMW region has meant nothing to us in the west in terms of job creation and infrastructural development. We have a new cliché in the west at present: the Atlantic corridor is now the phrase in vogue. The Minister for Public Enterprise has responsibility for the delivery of broadband infrastructure to the west but she has failed miserably in that task. It is just one more of the Government's failures in a time of plenty. The Sligo &ndash; Tuam &ndash; Gort &ndash; Ennis &ndash; Limerick rail line is lying disused for a long time. There is traffic chaos in many towns in the west because of the inadequacy of the infrastructure and the Government has not considered redeveloping this railway line. The phrase &ldquo;Atlantic corridor&rdquo; means nothing to us in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has a duty to deliver the necessary infrastructure to the western region and this Bill provides that opportunity. The proposed pipeline from Dublin will meet the north-south axis in Craughwell, County Galway, about seven miles from my home. I compliment Bord Gáis for the manner in which they dealt with the landowners through whose land the pipeline will be laid. They dealt with them in a positive manner, held meetings with them and resolved any difficulties. This contrasts with the NRA whose communications with the farming community and <Col N="387" /> landowners have been a monumental disaster. Will the Government allow pipelines to traverse and dissect our county yet not provide a service? Loughrea is five miles from the junction point and Ballinasloe, Gort and Athenry are within a narrow radius. If that happens it will amount to a great western robbery. We will not allow it.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed in its policy of job creation for east Galway. Not one IDA assisted job has been created in Ballinasloe in the past 25 years. That is a record of monumental failure. With an election approaching we are told that 1,000 jobs will be created in County Galway, yet the Government is afraid, for considerations of political advantage, to say where they will be located. In the past 15 to 20 years all new jobs have been located in Galway city, where there has been an enormous rate of development. However, it has been at the expense of the county's satellite towns, such as Loughrea, Ballinasloe, Gort, Athenry and Tuam. Despite the Government's neglect, private enterprise has managed to provide additional jobs without which these would be ghost towns, even though they are so near the fastest growing city in Europe. This gas pipeline must benefit the development of the infrastructure, which will help to provide additional jobs. In view of this, there is an obligation on the Minister of State to ensure that the resources of the gas field will benefit the west, especially County Galway.</P>
    <P>South County Galway presents an ideal environment for the development of wind energy, which will help to balance the energy deficit in the west. We are continually told by industrialists that the west does not have sufficient energy resources and back-up to ensure a guaranteed supply to industry, especially the very important IT sector. According to<i> The Irish Times</i> today, the ESB has been granted approval by An Bord Pleanála to proceed with the construction of an electricity generating station at Shannonbridge. I welcome that but it is regrettable that An Taisce was the main objector.</P>
    <P>An Taisce and Dúchas, acting together, have determinedly stifled the production of a clean form of energy in south County Galway in the form of a £40 million project. It was turned down but is now with An Bord Pleanála for a final decision. If sanction is withheld, Dúchas should be disbanded forthwith because it objected on the grounds that a pair of hen harriers were found, not on the site but within the immediate vicinity. If a Government agency is to stifle the improvement of infrastructure, especially in energy supply, in the west, where it is so badly needed, because of the possible influence it may have on a pair of hen harriers, what has the country come to? Are we serious about the development of the west or are we paying lip service to it?</P>
    <P>Nobody is suggesting we must wreck our natural environment or wildlife to develop the west but there must be a balance. It will not be provided for as long as a Government agency, <Col N="388" /> operating under the auspices of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, seeks to stall a £40 million development, involving a co-operative of farmers who have come together to make an investment in wind energy as an alternative to farming, which is so difficult to conduct at this time. On five occasions I have asked the Minister of State examine this. I again ask him to examine it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State must ensure the gas will be distributed to the benefit and the potential development of the west. Connection spurs should be constructed to Loughrea, Ballinasloe, Athenry and Gort. If there is to be yet another great western robbery we will object in the most strenuous manner possible.</P>

      <P>Natural gas is one of the most important natural resources at our disposal, economically and otherwise. Since the Government took up office many consultants have been appointed to analyse the energy capacity of the country but despite their reports, which have been brought to the attention of the Minister of State, the country faces an energy crisis. Hardly a month goes by when various groups and organisations, especially IBEC, express their concern.</P>
      <P>In view of this, I welcome the sanction given to the development of a wind farm by Eirtricity off the coast of County Wicklow, beside the Minister of State's constituency. The decision was long overdue. It will add to the national grid.</P>
      <P>Despite the country's huge economic growth and the fact that the Minster for Public Enterprise has been long aware of the ESB's need to generate greater capacity, it has taken until the eleventh hour of this Government's term of office before a substantial decision has been made to address the problem of energy generating capacity. The next Government will also have to address it. There is a lack of planning at present but a planned approach to the problem is urgently required. The interconnector from Scotland to Ireland is one aspect and the additional resource off the west coast will provide another source of gas supply which will feed into the energy sector. However, much more could be done to connect natural gas to industries, ports and households throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I made representations to the Minster of State's Department indicating that a private company in south Kilkenny was willing, through public private partnership and in conjunction with Bord Gáis, to connect to the Belview port, which is based in my constituency in south Kilkenny and which services a large number of industries and businesses in the south east. It is situated on the edge of Waterford city and the planning authority is Kilkenny County Council. I got an acknowledgement, but I heard <Col N="389" /> nothing else about it. This was a case in which people were prepared to put up their own money to help the State, through Bord Gáis, to supply an important natural resource for the benefit of port related activities and jobs for the south east region at a time when they are badly needed.</P>
    <P>The attitude of Bord Gáis in recent years through its monopoly has been disgraceful. I have never come across a State monopoly which has been so unwilling to assist, through public private partnerships, in the connection of its gas and energy network to towns throughout a region, in this case the south east region. In spite of my best efforts to have gas connected to Belview Port, with the assistance of a private company which is willing to take on the project, it has not happened. It is about time we introduced legislation that will ensure we have a more accountable Bord Gáis than has been the case heretofore.</P>
    <P>Some of the people engaged in the operational work of the board of Bord Gáis do not realise they are working on behalf of the people. It was taxpayers' money which allowed the gas from the Kinsale gas field to be brought ashore. Taxpayers' money also ensured that we have the network that exists today, and it is to the taxpayers that these people should be accountable through the Minister of State. There has been no accountability on the part of Bord Gáis to this House or to the Minister of State, and he has not gone out of his way to ensure proper stewardship of the operations of Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>I express my deep disappointment at the attitude of Bord Gáis towards any proposal it received to assist it in the provision of natural gas to towns and port related activities at Belview in Waterford. I hope in the course of this debate the Minister of State will take the opportunity to determine the up to date position in terms of the provision of natural gas as an essential part of the energy infrastructure to create employment opportunities and economic activity at Belview Port in Waterford.</P>
    <P>I made representations on the need to connect natural gas to the town of Callan in County Kilkenny. The national gas grid from Cork to Dublin goes through Kilkenny and is only 500 metres from the town of Callan. Industrial users indicated they were prepared to take on natural gas. There are approximately 700 dwellings with planning permission yet to be built in the town of Callan, but all I got from Bord Gáis was the standard reply to the effect that it is not possible to do it at this stage because of the economic cost involved. What is the economic cost of allowing the national gas grid to be connected for the benefit of the people of Callan? There is a gas station 500 metres from the town of Callan yet in its usual replies Bord Gáis states it will not connect the town to the national grid. This highly efficient, clean fuel would create economic activity and a better quality of life for the domestic users of Callan in County Kilkenny. I cannot understand the economic cost of connecting a pipe to a gas station 500 metres away. Perhaps <Col N="390" /> there is precedent involved but I was not told that. It is ridiculous that people who are willing to put up money to ensure the provision of this essential, cheap and efficient energy supply have been turned down again by Bord Gáis. That is an abuse of the monopoly vested in Bord Gáis since its foundation and the Minister of State, through this legislation, should ensure that we have proper accountability and a better service from Bord Gáis on behalf of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>We are not fortunate enough to be in the BMW region. All the statistics in recent years indicate clearly that the south east lags behind other regions in terms of economic development and prosperity. We need the provision of this cheaper form of energy to create a more competitive environment in the south east region. Our region is affected by the weather but we do not always get the necessary assistance other regions receive in terms of hand-outs. This form of energy stimulation in the region would be of considerable assistance in generating additional economic activity. There are people in the private sector who are willing to help out and I hope the Minster of State will be able to compel Bord Gáis to be a little more reasonable in terms of the provision of this important energy resource to the south east region.</P>
    <P>Emissions from various fuels are unsavoury. Greenhouse gas emissions are a major issue and will become more so here in the future. One of the areas where there is great concern and which contributes enormously to the level of greenhouse gas emissions is Moneypoint. A decision is required to connect gas to Moneypoint and to deal with that clean energy source off our coast as quickly as possible. I am aware the Government is considering that matter but I hope it will be fast-tracked to ensure that the issue of greenhouse emissions is dealt with by the provision of natural gas to Moneypoint station as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We need greater accountability from Bord Gáis. We need more connections to the areas I have mentioned, particularly in the south east region, and we must help Bord Gáis to realise that a new era is developing in the provision of services and that there are private individuals who wish to contribute to developing greater energy capacity. Bord Gáis must modernise its thinking and with leadership from the Minister of State, we can ensure that happens.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Natural gas is an efficient and cheap form of energy, and we were all delighted when the Kinsale natural gas field was discovered in the early 1970s. That was a tremendous boost to the south region because it contributed to economic <Col N="391" /> development and provided an efficient and cheap source of energy not only to domestic users but to industry and business in that area.</P>
    <P>In one of the papers last January there was a press release from Bord Gáis announcing a &euro;1 billion expansion of the national gas grid to embrace the midlands and the west regions. That is a huge investment which will expand the grid to different parts of the country. It is excellent news that a field has been found off the north west coast of Mayo, the Corrib gas field, which is comparable to the Kinsale field. It was also stated in the press release that the gas will be brought ashore at Pollatomish, in County Mayo, and will be piped from Pollatomish down to Galway where it will join the new proposed pipeline from Dublin to Galway, which is envisaged to pass through Ennis and on to County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I am amazed the entire north west region has been left out of the proposed extended national grid. According to the map included in the press release, the north west, and particularly Donegal, is a barren desert. It looks as if nothing exists there. A map of the national primary roads in the country also shows that in terms of investment in road infrastructure, the north west, including Donegal, is a barren desert in that provision has not been made for that part of the country. A natural resource was found in an area off the north west coast and the priority is to pipe that gas resource to other parts of the country as quickly as possible and overlook the hinterland where it was found. That priority is difficult to understand and justify.</P>
    <P>I do not need to tell the House again of the economic difficulties in the north west, including Donegal, where there are major deficits in road and energy infrastructure. The ESB had plans to bring a 110 kv line into different parts of Donegal, including the western side of the county from which I come. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that the ESB ran into difficulties with An Bord Pleanála and that its plans to bring an adequate supply of energy to support and underpin industry and attract new industry, particularly in the IT sector, to Donegal, have been temporarily held up.</P>
    <P>Natural gas is usually piped underground and, in that way, does not intrude on the landscape. Natural gas piped underground could be an ideal way to supply energy to the picturesque parts of the country in the north west without despoiling the landscape.</P>
    <P>There may be plans to bring the natural gas supply to Sligo, but it is disappointing that there does not seem to be any plan to bring it further north. Donegal and other towns in the north west have been overlooked. I refer to Balllyshannon, which would benefit from an investment in industry, Donegal town, Letterkenny and the Gaeltacht areas in the west of the county. It is unforgivable that when such a resource is in abundance, the priority is to pipe it to regions of the country that already have adequate sources <Col N="392" /> of energy not alone to provide for domestic consumption but for industry.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in the north west is that the energy infrastructure is not sufficient to attract industry to locate there. There is not a constant supply of energy to that part of the country. That has been brought to my attention on numerous occasions and I am sure the Minister of State is also aware of that. The unemployment rate in Donegal of between 15% and 20%, compared to the national average of 4%, is one of the highest in the country. Unless we examine the energy needs of regions such as Donegal, we are not serious about attracting industry to locate there.</P>
    <P>Gas is a valuable natural resource, but the most valuable natural resource we have is the people living in an area. Our aim must be to allow the people who live in that region to remain in their own environment and to provide employment for them in their own areas. We must keep that valuable natural resource, our people, at home. One of the ways of doing that is to provide the necessary industry and jobs, but that cannot be done unless the necessary infrastructure, of which energy is such an important part, is in place.</P>
    <P>The gas pipeline from Dublin to Galway will serve Mullingar, Enfield in County Meath, Athlone and other places along that route right down to Galway. One could not help but think that there may have been some political influence at work because Cabinet Ministers live in those towns along that route, including in Galway. A spur line will extend the gas supply to Limerick via Ennis in County Clare and another Cabinet Minister lives there. It is only fair to pose the question, has there been political influence or interference at work to determine where this line will go? It is amazing that the pipeline will go out of its way not to bypass any town along that route where some Ministers live. I do not know whether An Bord Gáis would own up to there having been political interference, but from looking at the map and taking account of the political landscape it would seem to me there has been.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed my region has been overlooked in terms of this gas supply. It suffers from a deficit in energy supply. Difficulties were experienced by the ESB in bringing an energy supply to the region. The provision of a gas supply would be the ideal solution. I hope an undertaking, or at least an indication, will be given that Donegal and the rest of the north west will not be bypassed in terms of this valuable source of energy that would be of such benefit and is so necessary from the point of view of attracting industry, creating jobs and underpinning what is already there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill. I welcome the announcement yesterday regarding the provision of a new power station in Shannonbridge in Offaly. That decision is good for the peat industry. Coming from Kildare, I understand the essence and meaning of that industry for the <Col N="393" /> region in terms of the many jobs it has provided down through the years.</P>
      <P>When I was recently in a public house in Rathangan in Kildare, I noticed an article from a old newspaper on the wall stated that Bord na Móna was looking for 1,100 workers. While I suppose the numbers employed there are far from that now, it is great that it still provides the essence of employment in the midlands. Up to 400 jobs will be generated from the construction of this new power station and a number of permanent jobs will be created when it is built. There is an urgent need to provide such a power station, given the problems regarding the supply of energy by the ESB in the midlands.</P>
      <P>A major problem facing the midlands is the reconstruction of the supply of energy by the ESB. There has been major investment in industry in recent years, yet the necessary back-up service does not seem to be in place in the ESB to provide a proper service to facilitate further advances in such development in the midlands.</P>
      <P>As part of my local authority's initiative, it will provide for the triangle towns of Newbridge, Naas and Kilcullen. There have been major developments in industrial and commercial parks, but power failures are experienced in those areas on an ongoing basis. The ESB and the Minister need to express an interest in this matter and ensure the necessary finance is made available. A plan should be drawn up to meet the needs of further development of this area.</P>
      <P>There has been a major increase in the population of these areas. Kildare has zoomed up the ladder in terms of the increase in population along the eastern seaboard. There is no town or village in Kildare that has not experienced an increase in population and that has led to an increase in the demand for electricity.</P>
      <P>It is up to us as legislators to ensure nothing is put in the way of such development and that it will not be hindered or put on the long finger due to the lack of availability of and electricity supply, one of the basic utilities necessary for such development.</P>
      <P>The same can be said of the gas lines. There is a major gas initiative in Kildare. Even the small hamlets where I reside, which are on the line, will have their heating provided from a natural resource. I benefited because the line went by my house. Had Deputy McGinley been here he would have suggested I had something to do with it. I had nothing to do with the particular line except to take the connection and appreciate the value of natural gas to a particular household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However there are shortfalls. Despite the PR exercise by Bord Gáis in respect of the line to which I have referred and the efforts to advance its sale, many people are waiting seven, eight and nine months for supply. Many do not know what to do or whether supply will be available in the shortterm. It is difficult to get a reply from Bord Gáis on the criteria for those connections. It is a slap in the face to those who gave their money to <Col N="394" /> Bord Gáis and yet have to wait eight and nine months for supply.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of Athy UDC last night where a motion was put down demanding that Bord Gáis attend its next meeting to explain its actions in relation to its failure to honour commitments given at a previous meeting about 12 months ago. At that meeting Bord Gáis had all the brochures and documentation, so much so that I almost thought we would have supply the following morning. Yet nine months on people in that area, especially old age pensioners who have given the money, do not know whether to invest in an alternative supply. Because of this people lose faith in the system. Local authorities are latching on to the value of the natural gas supply. In Lakeside Park, Newbridge, there is a project where 50 houses in the ownership of the local authority will be connected to the gas line. Will the same problem arise in that area as to when they will be connected? </P>
    <P>While I appreciate the function of a regulator is not to deal with the bottom level I hope that when a regulator is appointed the commitment given by Bord Gáis will be honoured. I hope those who gave that commitment will come back to the people, instead of a situation where the phone is not answered and where the old age pensioner has to approach the local representative or a member of the local council where their house is located to demand information on the whereabouts of their money, the connection and when supply will be made available. That is bad in the overall context of making supply available throughout the country. It is great to think there will be a natural gas supply to all towns. The local authorities have the will to deal with a connection when it comes into a town. Some local authorities are seeking that the main line, or a spur, go through their town because of the bonus to the town in terms of seeking alternative industrial development.</P>
    <P>We have got to ensure Bord Gáis provides a detailed plan of its proposals in relation to pipelines throughout the country. In regard to the proposed line in Mayo, about which much has been said regarding appeals and a counter appeal to An Bord Pleanála, I hope common sense will prevail at the end of the day. This should not be allowed develop to a point where the national plan will be put in jeopardy because we do not appear to come in line with environmentalists or local objections. Every effort should be made to ensure existing problems are met. The only way this can be done is through constant consultation with the local community and environmentalists who appear to take a hold on every local authority.</P>
    <P>I was in my local authority office the other day where five men were examining 70 or 80 files for An Taisce. Many of those applications will be appealed to An Bord Pleanála, the result of which may be a disappointment for many families. This appears to be the trend not only in Kildare but right across the country. It is a worry<Col N="395" /> ing trend at a time when there is a need for a natural resource we may have difficulty in bringing it on stream.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of the peat powered stations in the midlands given the closure of stations at Rhode, Ferbane and Allenwood where there had been many problems. It is encouraging that the ESB is replacing the station at Shannonbridge and also providing a new station. In that regard there will be a continuation and an involvement by Bord na Móna which is of major importance to the midlands and has been a great employer in the past. It should be congratulated on its efforts.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to Greece I saw the many wind farms that are being developed. That is another form of power that would be welcome here. There is a problem here in regard to objections etc. but at the end of the day we must have the maximum amount of electricity to allow the country develop. It is necessary to follow up every aspect of that under the remit of all the State agencies to ensure we have the means to allow the country develop in a commercial, industrial and residential manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and am pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. As the Minister of State is aware we had a parallel discussion at the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport on electricity regulation. It appears this is a parallel Bill designed to regulate Bord Gáis and to give us the opportunity to review its activities. I compliment the board on the efficient and effective manner in which it has operated since its foundation.</P>
      <P>I have one or two questions for the Minister for State on this Bill. Will it be possible under it, to raise issues in the House relating to the operation of Bord Gáis? We have found over the years, for example in the case of the Electricity Supply Board on matters of electricity generation and distribution, that it has been impossible to raise questions in the House. Such questions are generally ruled out of order as the Minister does not have responsibility in the area. It is important that Members can raise issues in relation to gas regulation and distribution in the House when they wish to do so. Will it be possible to raise such questions under this legislation? I am sure that if it is not possible to do it in the House, it will be possible to do it in certain committees. I have been in this House for quite some years and I have found it a disadvantage at times that Deputies are unable to raise fundamental issues about the operation of the ESB. It may have been better for all concerned, including the ESB, if Deputies had such a function. It is a minor issue and possibly not entirely relevant to the Bill under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituents have expressed some concern in recent weeks since Bord Gáis began to lay its <Col N="396" /> pipeline to Cork through County Clare. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that the line passes near Gort and Ennis and meets the Shannon Estuary near Labasheeda. Many people have complained about the damage to the county roads network in west Clare during the work that was done by Bord Gáis. Will Clare County Council be compensated for the inconvenience caused to many local communities when the pipeline was being laid? Small by-roads in west Clare, where I live, were damaged and local people have made representations as a result. Will Bord Gáis provide adequate financing as compensation or will the ancillary damage that was done during the operations of Bord Gáis be repaired?</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the possibility of extending to Kilrush, which is adjacent to Moneypoint, the gas pipeline that goes to Cork. The original proposals for laying the pipeline through County Clare contained a suggestion that the line be extended to Moneypoint, with the intention of converting the power station there from imported coal to gas at some point in the future. I recommend that we think twice about such a conversion, especially as the reason Moneypoint power station was developed as a coal fired station in the first instance was to move away from our dependence on imported oil. The decision taken at that time was a wise one, as Moneypoint has proven to be an efficient station which is effective in meeting the demand for power. The country would probably come to a standstill if Moneypoint was not there.</P>
    <P>There has been some concern about emissions from Moneypoint and we are right to be concerned. It has been suggested from time to time that additional facilities be installed in the power station's chimneys to reduce emissions. A large volume of research has been done in Europe into clean coal technology. A huge investment has been made in this area as Europe is so dependent on coal and may need to diversify its sources of power. It is generally acknowledged that adequate supplies of coal are available at reasonable and stable prices. Ireland should be at the forefront of research into clean coal technologies and additional funding should be provided to Moneypoint so that emissions can be reduced.</P>
    <P>It would be unwise, short-sighted and unnecessary to convert the coal fired station at Moneypoint into a gas fired station. The huge expense that would be involved in such a conversion has been estimated at up to £400 million. The converted station may not operate as efficiently as a newly built power station. I strongly suggest that Bord Gáis and the ESB should reconsider the proposal, although I do not think it will happen in any event. It would be far wiser and more efficient to build a new gas fired station adjacent to the existing station at Moneypoint if additional generation capacity is needed. It would be preferable if we retained the coal fired station as a back-up, as it is so important for Ireland's electricity supply. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, should discuss the possibility of developing <Col N="397" /> a new gas station adjacent to Moneypoint with the ESB, Bord Gáis and the authorities at Moneypoint. It could cheaply and effectively feed into the national grid, while supporting the existing station.</P>
    <P>Further research into clean coal technologies, similar to those being developed in Europe, is needed on the part of the agencies attached to the Department of Public Enterprise. The research could be used to reduce emissions at Moneypoint and make the station more efficient, while continuing to provide the dependable generating capacity we have enjoyed over the years. Electricity can be generated at a smaller cost by burning coal than by using gas, which is quite an expensive commodity. The only reason to convert Moneypoint to gas is to reduce emissions, but I believe they can now be dealt with far more effectively than when the station was built. New technology should be put to use in Moneypoint. I compliment the board of the ESB for the work it has done to reduce emissions in Moneypoint and this should be continued.</P>
    <P>The point I really want to make is that if there is to be a gas connection to Moneypoint, it should be to facilitate the construction of a new gas station adjacent to Moneypoint. The conversion of the existing station to gas would not make economic sense and would be totally crazy. When the gas line is being extended to Moneypoint, I ask that a spur line be laid to Kilrush, a town that would welcome a supply of gas for industrial and domestic purposes. The people of the town are frustrated that a pipeline bringing gas from the west to Cork will pass near them but will not be of any use to them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the passage of this Bill any longer, as it may be possible to receive clarification of certain issues on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister of State to consider the points I made in relation to parliamentary questions and the payment of compensation to Clare County Council for repair of the damage done to roads when the pipeline was being laid. The disruption and inconvenience that was caused needs to be examined and I ask the Minister to outline if this can be done.</P>

      <P>I thank the 12 Deputies who contributed today for their valuable comments, as well as those who outlined their opinions on an earlier date. This complex Bill provides for independent regulation of the gas industry. The establishment of an independent regulatory body for the gas sector, unconnected with any operator in the sector, is the best option for ensuring future confidence in the market. I do not take lightly the transfer of regulatory responsibility to independent agencies. However, the model being used has been adopted successfully in liberalised markets in Europe and elsewhere and I am convinced it is the best model all round. I will table amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage and pay particular attention to <Col N="398" /> the constructive contributions of colleagues during this debate.</P>
      <P>I will now endeavour to respond to some of the points raised by Members. Deputy Jim Higgins expressed concern regarding the adequacy of the powers of the regulator to ensure competition takes place. I agree with the Deputy on the importance of this issue. However, I am confident that the provisions of the Bill provide more than sufficient powers to ensure all those seeking access to the national gas grid are provided with this assurance on a fair and reasonable basis. Effective third party access is the main prerequisite to developing competition in gas and I am confident that the regulator will be able to ensure this is provided for those who require it.</P>
      <P>The Corrib gas field was referred to by a number of Deputies as was the issue of the towns to be connected to the Mayo-Galway pipeline. Other Deputies raised the possibility of connecting other areas to the national grid. Deputy Browne mentioned Wexford, Deputy Enright set out the case for connecting counties Laois and Offaly, Deputy Deenihan spoke in favour of a gas supply to the Ballylongford-Tarbert land bank and Deputy Daly wanted gas to be brought to Kilrush which is close to my heart as it is the town of my birth. I share the Deputy's aspiration in that regard.</P>
      <P>However, we are all aware of the reality that in developing and extending the gas network BGE is obliged to adhere to commercial criteria. In other words, such extensions must be capable of paying for themselves. The commerciality of extending the network to a particular area is determined by the size of the projected demand, together with the cost of the feeder main. Following this policy BGE has successfully connected gas supplies to many towns during the years. I understand the question of network extensions to likely areas is kept under regular review by the company. I am as anxious as anyone that a gas supply be extended to as many towns as is feasible. BGE has informed me that it is assessing the economic viability of connecting a number of towns to the Mayo-Galway pipeline and has signalled that Castlebar, Westport, Tuam and Athenry are being considered in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of oil and gas exploration was raised by Deputy Higgins and others in terms of the return to the State from the Corrib field. Deputy Stagg pointed out that when the terms for exploration leases were agreed in 1992 there was a need to give the greatest encouragement to the development of this area. Deputy Sargent called for a renegotiation of the terms of the leases. The question of future possible changes in this area is, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey. Deputy Sargent pointed to suggestions that the Corrib gas should be kept in the ground until a later date. However, the reality is that the gas now belongs to those companies which <Col N="399" /> invested in the exploration and they are entitled to it and to sell it as they see fit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent also mentioned the possibility that exploration companies may be withholding information on the true extent of their discoveries. If the Deputy has any hard information in this regard, I ask him to present it without delay to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, who is the appropriate Minister in order that it can be properly and expeditiously investigated.</P>
    <P>The accountability of the regulator was raised by Deputies Stagg and Stanton. This issue cannot be divorced from the question of regulatory independence. This point was recognised in a document referred to by Deputy Stanton published in March 2000 by the Minister for Public Enterprise which set out the policy on governance and accountability in the regulatory process. The document took account of the experience to date in this area and the wide-ranging views expressed in response to a discussion document issued on the subject the previous year. There is a delicate balance to be struck between ensuring the accountability of regulatory authorities and safeguarding their independence. This balance is achieved in the framework established by the Bill and the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, by clearly defining the duties and responsibilities of the commission, and ensuring transparency in the decision making process.</P>
    <P>The accountability of the commission is further enhanced by the obligations on the commission regarding its annual accounts. The audited accounts, with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, are submitted to the Minister who is required to lay copies before each House of the Oireachtas. Furthermore, the commission is required to account for the performance of its functions before an Oireachtas joint committee whenever so requested by the committee. Deputy Stagg raised the issue of the resources available to the committee to carry out its functions. While there is food for thought in some of the issues put forward by the Deputy regarding the committee system, he will agree that this is a wider issue which is well outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton raised the issue of the effectiveness of regulation in Ireland. In this context, I refer the Deputy to the OECD review carried out last year on regulatory reform in this country which highlighted many positive aspects of our regulatory regime and also pointed to areas where progress must be made. Among these areas were the need to establish independent regulation in the gas sector and to increase liberalisation of the sector, matters which are being dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg suggested that there was a delay in proceeding with the second interconnector as a result of which we are short of gas. I categorically state that the country is not, and will not be, short of gas. The interconnector will be in place next October as planned and fully on schedule, <Col N="400" /> and well in time to meet the forecasted demand for next winter.</P>
    <P>Deputies Stagg and Sargent mentioned the issue of security of supply and the need to develop our usage of renewables and alternative technologies. The Bill is primarily concerned with establishing independent regulation in the gas sector, not with the use of alternative energies. I am dealing with the issue of alternative energy sources by other, more appropriate, means in terms of demand side management and the promotion of renewable energy technologies.</P>
    <P>The Sustainable Energy Bill completed its progress through the Oireachtas last night and I am grateful to the Chief Whip for facilitating the passage of this important legislation during this session. Deputy Higgins and others are pleased that the Bill has reached this stage. As a result, the Irish Energy Centre will become the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, with increased funding and staffing resources. It will be one of the main agencies contributing to the Government's efforts to meet our Kyoto obligations. I assure Deputy Stanton that the work of the authority will not be impinged on in any way by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent mentioned the benefits of gas in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly when use is also made of combined heat and power technology. The Bill encourages the use of this technology by allowing that all generators of electricity, including those using CHP, irrespective of their levels of gas consumption, are now eligible to avail of third party access rights to source their supplies of gas. The question of security of supply has been raised by a number of people. I can confirm that the Bill contains provisions to enhance Ireland's security of supply. It gives to the commission a clear monitoring and reporting role with regard to our present and future capacity to meet demand for gas and electricity. It will also give the commission the power to hold a competitive process for the provision of gas pipelines where it determines there is a need that is not being met.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins raised the issue of safety and the remit of the commission in this regard. Primary responsibility for safety in the gas network, including safety downstream from the meter, rests with the network operator. The regulator's duty is to ensure the operator carries out its responsibilities in full. The regulator will have full powers to impose conditions on operators with regard to safety with any licence it grants. Deputy Higgins also sought clarification on sections 4, 5 and 7, which deal with legal proceedings. I can confirm that the Deputy's understanding of those provisions is correct. Deputy Stagg mentioned the possibility of privatisation. As I stated in my introductory speech, the Bill before us contains no provisions for the future shape or direction of Bord Gáis. It simply provides for independent regulation of the natural gas sector. As for the future of the company, my Department is working on separate legislative <Col N="401" /> proposals including provisions for transforming Bord Gáis Éireann from a statutory corporation to a public limited company. We hope to introduce a Bill later this year. It is my view that establishing BGE as a public limited company will allow it greater freedom to operate in a liberalised market. I should make it clear, however, that there are no proposals on the table for privatisation of BGE.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kenny, Reynolds and others asked about proposals for a pipeline to Sligo. As I have said before, the Government has decided in principle to extend the gas transmission system to Sligo via Ballina from the proposed Mayo to Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny from Derry. The decision recognises that these extensions would not be viable on the basis of anticipated gas demand and that considerable grant aid will be required. A formal decision was taken in Cabinet and the Taoiseach has resolved that the gas infrastructure be extended to the west and the north west. That decision was taken in the knowledge that it would not stand on its own economic feet and that State aid would be required.</P>
    <P>The next step in moving the project forward involves carrying out detailed engineering and planning work to establish a firm estimate of the capital costs. Once this phase is completed and a firm estimate of the capital costs has been established, the Government will be able to consider further the question of grant aid. Given that there are issues of competition and State aid involved, it is essential to ensure that the approach to the next stage of the project does not create difficulties which might result in the project being delayed down the line. We have all had experience of how State aid works and I have experienced hold-ups in other areas of my own portfolio in the context of State aid issues. We want to get it right first time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny raised the matter of the planning process with regard to the Mayo-Galway pipeline. The decision to grant planning permission for such a pipeline, as the Deputy well knows, is a matter for the relevant local authority and, on appeal, for An Bord Pleanála. BGE is carrying out certain preparations in advance of permission's being granted but this must be seen as the prudent actions of a commercial company, given the need to complete such projects in a tight timeframe. BGE has an excellent record of meeting targets on schedule and we certainly want it to do this during the massive programme of infrastructural improvement taking place at present which includes the construction of a ring main, a second interconnector and so on. The company's actions should not be taken as a sign that the granting of planning permission is any type of rubber stamp or formality.</P>
    <P>Deputies Connaughton and Ring stated that towns in the west, particularly Mayo, should be supplied with gas from the Corrib fields. Deputy Connaughton asked that a legal right be inserted in the Bill to ensure this. Deputy Belton insisted that the Government give priority to making a <Col N="402" /> supply of gas available to the Longford area. Deputy Crawford asked that the Government ensure that all areas, particularly deprived areas such as Monaghan, should have an equal right to a gas supply. We all subscribe to that aspiration. Deputy Ring stated that the taxpayer would pay for the Mayo-Galway pipeline. It is important that I clarify that. The pipeline is to be funded by the company and the Corrib partners on a purely commercial basis. The taxpayer is not being asked to fund this pipeline.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked about the projected life span of the Corrib and Kinsale fields and the potential of finding any other gas fields, as was the case with the Seven Heads field. I do not have that information here, but I will try to get the information to the Deputy as soon as possible. As an indication, last year BGE celebrated the 21st anniversary of its bringing gas ashore at Kinsale. Gas has been obtained from Kinsale for about 22 years now and I am advised that Corrib is about two thirds the size of Kinsale. I would like to have been able to respond to the contributions of Deputies McGinley, Hogan, Wall and Daly among others, but I have come to the end of my run. I thank all who have contributed to the debate and I look forward to dealing further with these issues on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to present this Bill to the House. The Bill provides for the establishment of a dedicated Civil Defence Board, funded by the State, which will be representative of its principal stakeholders involved such as Government Departments, State agencies, county managers, Civil Defence officers and volunteers together with outside expertise.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is twofold. Firstly, its purpose is to update Civil Defence legislation generally. Civil Defence currently operates under the Air Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 and a number of emergency powers orders. The various powers conferred by the aforementioned legislation, which was brought about by the climate of uncertainty created during and after the Second World War and later by the Cold War, will remain unaffected by the introduction of this Bill except for two minor provisions of the 1939 Act to which I will refer. This Bill will provide the necessary legislative framework for the future development of the Civil Defence organisation. The creation of such a framework to enhance the development of Civil Defence to the year 2010 and beyond was an important element of the chapter on Civil Defence contained in the Government's White Paper on Defence published in February 2000. I am pleased to say that as the Minister with delegated responsibility for Civil Defence I have honoured the policy commitment to create that framework by introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Bill will provide for the establishment of a board of management to be known as An Bord Cosanta Sibhialta or, in English, the Civil Defence Board which will, in general, oversee, supervise and co-ordinate the operation and future development of Civil Defence at national level, in co-operation with and in support of all the major emergency services such as the Garda, fire service, ambulance service and coastguard. The board will also advise the Minister on policy issues and will, in effect, carry out all of the non-policy roles relating to Civil Defence that have up to now been carried out with distinction by the Civil Defence branch of <Col N="404" /> the Department of Defence. Political accountability to the Oireachtas for the discharge of its functions by the new board will, of course, remain with me as the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence was originally set up in 1950 to be part of the national defence structure. It was designed to undertake non-combatant activities and measures to afford defence against, mitigate, minimise and forestall the effects on persons and property of an attack on the State or of hazards otherwise arising from war-like weapons, radioactive fallout or biological or chemical warfare and, in particular, includes measures taken under the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939. Civil Defence currently operates under the Air Raid Precautions Acts of 1939 and 1946, the Local Government Acts of 1941, 1955, 1960, 1963, 1976, and various statutory instruments. The Minister for Defence delegates responsibility for Civil Defence to the Minister of State at the Department of Defence. The Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence facilitates, through the local authorities, civil defence responses for emergency relief and support to ensure the operation of vital services and the maintenance of public life and to provide other community supports as directed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The work of the branch involves <i>inter alia</i> planning, organising, financing, training and equipping the local authorities. The Department of Defence currently pays 70% of the approved Civil Defence expenditure in each local authority area and this arrangement will continue under the new Bill. The Department provides equipment such as vehicles, boating equipment, rescue and other equipment, uniforms and protective items as required to support the provision of various local services. The new board will invigorate the organisation in the planning, recruiting, training and equipment areas.</P>
    <P>Each local authority provides Civil Defence services that are administered by a designated officer, the Civil Defence officer, who reports to the county or city manager. There are currently approximately 6,000 volunteer members in the organisation. They are recruited within their local areas and are offered training in various skills such as first aid, rescue, fire fighting, emergency feeding and evacuee care, land and water search and radiation monitoring. Civil Defence provides the community with trained teams who can and do assist in an emergency or support local community events.</P>
    <P>With the end of the Cold War, the principal focus of Civil Defence in the 1990s changed to one of community support and emergency response. This was highlighted with the launch in 1992 of the development programme Towards 2000 which was designed to put in place the structures and develop the skills that would enable the organisation to face the future challenges. The aim of the programme was to develop Civil Defence as a top class second-line emergency service within the local community. The Department of Defence introduced an organisational, training, <Col N="405" /> equipment and logistical support programme to facilitate meeting the Towards 2000 objectives.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence members are very dedicated and highly committed to the idea of voluntary community service, and I salute them for their work. They are part of a structured and disciplined uniformed organisation under the direction of the local authority Civil Defence officer. A programme of national exercises which are conducted each year provides opportunities for large scale exercising of the members, which helps to broaden and improve skills, and a forum to inject external influence and expertise into the organisation. These exercises provide an opportunity for objective assessment of performance by their instructors or personnel from the primary emergency services. I thank the primary emergency services for their help in this regard.</P>
    <P>Equipment purchase and logistical support development have been progressing in accordance with the Towards 2000 programme. A primary focus in recent years has been upgrading the ambulance and transport fleet and completing the radio communications network. These are now to a very high standard and I and the Government are committed to maintaining the equipment at a high standard.</P>
    <P>The review that ultimately culminated in the launch of the Towards 2000 programme was aimed at giving the volunteer organisation a current operational role in society, to make it productive and to have a resource available, if required, in wartime. It took account of the fact that planning structures that would emerge for any future national emergency would be different from those originally envisaged for Civil Defence. Any new formation would be based on the framework of the major emergency plan which was being employed to organise the emergency responses of local authorities, the Garda Síochána and health boards. The Civil Defence can take its place along side the other services and this will continue to be the focus for the organisation in the future.</P>
    <P>Since 1992, the organisation has been learning to operate in close support of the front-line emergency services and so integrate in a meaningful way into the day-to-day emergency planning structures. This has allowed the Civil Defence organisation to focus on serving the needs of local communities. As I have already said, this trend will be continued and developed under the new legislation, which I introduce today. Generally feedback from stakeholders with regard to Civil Defence is positive and this was confirmed in the consultative process undertaken in the context of the White Paper which demonstrated without doubt the commitment of those involved in Civil Defence. The submissions were very supportive of the progress made under the Towards 2000 programme without forgetting the valuable work undertaken by members over many years.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence volunteer force is maintained at a very modest cost, has a substantial history of working at supporting its local and <Col N="406" /> national community in times of need and has maintained its voluntary ethos even while working side by side with the full and part-time professional services. The voluntary nature of the organisation will be preserved. There is a particular culture and ethos associated with voluntary activity which is widely recognised as being important in community life. This must be nurtured at all levels by continuing to build co-operative relationships with other service organisations but maintaining the distinctiveness of Civil Defence. The volunteer nature of the Civil Defence organisation gives each citizen the opportunity to serve his or her community and it is the public face of the delivery of local authority services at many events.</P>
    <P>The progress of the Better Local Government initiative of the Department of the Environment and Local Government highlights the importance of such factors.</P>
    <P>Following on from the commitment to create a modern legislative framework that I mentioned earlier and well in advance of the horrific events of 11 September last, I reviewed the operations of Civil Defence and concluded that the best way forward for the further development of Civil Defence into a first class second line emergency service, working in support of the first line services while retaining its focus on community support and most importantly its voluntary ethos, would be by bringing the organisation under the control of a dedicated board of management.</P>
    <P>In any organisation geared to emergency response and community support, the quality of the training which the volunteer receives is of paramount importance if that organisation is to flourish and meet the needs of the community while providing the right environment for both developing and retaining the services of qualified volunteers and for attracting new members. Under this Bill, the new Civil Defence board will be empowered to initiate and foster contacts with other Departments and State authorities, external educational and research institutions, both national and international, as well as utilising its own resources to enable it to develop optimum standards for the training of volunteers.</P>
    <P>As is common to all voluntary organisations in modern times, recruiting new Civil Defence members and retaining their services has proved difficult for the organisation. There is a wide variety of alternative attractions available to people of all ages, particularly to young people, to which to devote their spare time and, consequently, it is my intention that under this Bill, the Civil Defence board will devote a considerable portion of its energies to recruitment of new members and to retaining the services of existing members.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is the pivotal provision as it brings An Bord Cosanta Sibhialta, or the Civil Defence Board, into existence on the establishment day. That day will be appointed by order of the Minister under section 4. Section 8 sets out the many and varied functions of the Civil Defence Board. Of paramount importance is the provision in <Col N="407" /> section 8(<i>h</i>) for the board to advise the Minister for Defence on policy matters relating to civil defence on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister. It is my intention under this Bill that the board, which will be comprised of individuals and representatives dedicated to the future development of the organisation, will carry out its functions in an independent manner outside everyday ministerial or departmental control and will develop its own programmes and initiatives within general policy guidelines as provided in section 8(<i>o</i>).</P>
    <P>Among the board's other principal functions are the promotion, development and maintenance of Civil Defence as an effective voluntary service in support of the front line emergency services and in full co-operation with local authorities and with other State authorities and agencies as required. Civil Defence is essentially an emergency response organisation and while the board will be empowered to develop training, educational, planning, operational, and other standards particular to civil defence, this Bill provides for the board to carry out its functions in consultation and in co-operation with the various authorities responsible for the delivery of front line emergency services, particularly local authorities.</P>
    <P>A very important function for the new board will be promoting the role of Civil Defence in providing services to the community at local level and in developing programmes to enhance those services. The development of the community support services provided by Civil Defence have evolved since the ending of the Cold War and the threat from the old communist bloc of nations in eastern Europe but were given particular focus by the Towards 2000 development programme for Civil Defence introduced in 1992. They were then copperfastened as part of the policy framework for the future of Civil Defence set out in the White Paper in February of 2000. While Schedule 3 sets out the type of community support programmes to be developed by the board arising from section 8(3), it is not exhaustive in itself and the new board will be able to develop other community support services within the limits of its own resources and in support of the emergency services.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (<i>e</i>) provides for the board to develop plans and improve standards of civil defence education, training, knowledge, skill and equipment. These will be vital functions for the board as training, in particular, is the mainstay of any emergency response organisation. To assist it in that regard provision is made in section 8 (<i>i</i>) for the board to conduct and commission research and foster and promote contacts with educational institutions and other bodies engaged in civil defence activities at home and abroad. I am confident that with these provisions in place the new board will be sufficiently equipped to develop the training and skill base of the organisation to a such a level as to provide for the broad and mean<Col N="408" /> ingful development of existing members and also to provide an attractive platform for recruiting new members.</P>
    <P>In regard to equipment, I remind Deputies that with the introduction of the White Paper in 2000, the Government underlined its commitment to Civil Defence by providing an additional &euro;635,000 per annum for 2000 and the following years to be spent on equipment and training. I am pleased to say that, in terms of equipment, this additional funding has been spent on protective clothing for volunteers as well as the purchase of more boats and vehicles.</P>
    <P>In developing its training and equipment plans the board will, under section 8(<i>e</i>), have to take account of existing and future plans of Government and State agencies whose activities relate to civil defence. In addition to supporting Civil Defence planning at national level, at section 8 (<i>a</i>), provision is made at section 8(<i>j</i>) for the board, in consultation with those Government and State agencies, to contribute to the development of Civil Defence measures internationally which I believe is particularly appropriate in dealing with the consequences of horrific events such as those of 11 September last.</P>
    <P>There is provision in section 8(<i>f</i>) for the board to promote public awareness programmes in relation to Civil Defence and I expect that, in addition to providing a valuable service to the public, the new board will utilise this new provision to elevate the profile of the organisation in the public mind. This should prove useful to the board in carrying out the vital functions of recruiting new members to Civil Defence, in conjunction with local authorities, as provided for at section 8(<i>k</i>). A regular intake of new recruits is vital for the vibrancy of any voluntary organisation and I consider this function so important for the future of Civil Defence that I have provided later in the Bill, at section 27(4), for a committee of the board to be constituted specifically for that purpose. To conclude the functions provisions in the Bill I have included the standard provision at section 8(4) to allow for additional connected functions to be conferred on the board by the Minister after consultation, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the transfer of two functions of the Minister under the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, which I consider pertinent to the effective management of the organisation, to be transferred to the new board. Sections 60 and 61 of the 1939 Act allow for the training of persons and the provision and storage of equipment for civil defence purposes and related matters. In addition, section 9(1)(<i>b</i>) provides for the board to administer any compensation scheme for injury to persons engaged in Civil Defence activities put in place or introduced by the Minister. However, I must recognise that in the modern world in which we now live and taking account of international developments, such as the 11 September scenario, the possibility or probability of a deliberate or accidental disaster of major proportions affecting the nation could necessitate the <Col N="409" /> Minister, with Government approval, having to recall the authority of the board for the duration of such an emergency. I, therefore, propose to introduce an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage which would allow the Minister, on foot of a Government order declaring that a situation of major or national emergency had arisen, to take over the functions of the board for the duration. I emphasise, however, that this provision could only be exercised on foot of a major disaster and only with the full authority of the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the composition of the Civil Defence board which should not comprise more than 12 members. I intend this board to be as focused and efficient as possible in carrying out its functions and, therefore, any more than 12 members could be unwieldy. Consequently, I propose to bring forward an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The director general shall be a full member of the board in order to have a full and meaningful participation in the decision making processes of the organisation. The City and County Managers Association will be represented on the board. It is essential that a body representative of the people with day to day operational control of Civil Defence at local level has an input into all decisions affecting the future development of the organisation. The operational experience gained by managers in overseeing the activities of Civil Defence officers and volunteers in day to day operations assisting local communities, in addition to their expertise at the head of the local authority first line emergency services in their area, will be of invaluable assistance to the new board in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for up to four persons with external expertise to be members of the new board and assist the board by bringing their broad experience to bear on its work. I envisage these persons to be broadly representative of commercial, industrial and administrative interests countrywide and that they will assist the board with the benefit of their experience gained outside of the normal Civil Service structures. I would see particular relevance for the application of such expertise to developing the concept of strategic planning within the board structure and to providing impetus to developing proposals for the recruitment of new members to the organisation.</P>
    <P>It is vital for the Department charged with responsibility for co-ordinating the emergency plans of local authorities and with a supervisory and co-ordinating role in relation to all local authority activities to be represented on the new board. Consequently, the Bill provides for a representative from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with expertise in emergency planning to be a member of the board. The combination of their strategic experience in emergency planning at departmental and interdepartmental level and hands on experience of dealing with the first-line emergency services of local <Col N="410" /> authorities will be of invaluable assistance to the board in carrying out its functions and in preparing its development plans.</P>
    <P>It is important in terms of national emergency planning that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland be represented on the new board. With the many threats to our environment now evident, it is important that whatever first line service is charged with combating the particular threat can call on the resources of Civil Defence to support it in its endeavours. Having an EPA representative on the board will be of great assistance in developing strategies to offer support in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence officer, CDO, is the person charged with maintaining and developing the organisation at local authority level. The CDO, who is a full time local authority employee, is the pivotal contact between the local authority and the volunteers on the ground. He or she recruits, trains, equips and manages the many tasks demanded of the Civil Defence in its day-to-day operations. The CDO liaises with the Department on operational and monetary matters and, through the city-county manager, formulates and arranges for the implementation of Civil Defence plans. The Civil Defence Officers Association, CDOA, is a national organisation representative of CDOs and assistant CDOs and liaises with the Department on an ongoing basis on matters affecting its members. I consider it appropriate, therefore, that this organisation should be represented on the board and contribute to the management of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the most important member of any voluntary organisation, the volunteer. Without its volunteers, the Civil Defence would not and could not exist. It is vital that the voluntary ethos of the organisation is maintained and strengthened by this Bill. I consider it prudent and appropriate that the voice of the volunteer be clearly available on the management board and I have provided for this at section 10(<i>h</i>)(i).</P>
    <P>In line with best management practice and with the ethos of partnership I believe it is important that a member of staff is appointed to the board of management. This will provide a balance between staff and management as the board conducts its affairs and develops its strategic objectives. Section 10(4) provides for one member of the board to be designated as chairperson and section 11 contains related standard provisions regarding chairpersons. I also propose to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to section 13 and, consequently, Schedule 4 which will provide for a permanent civil servant to be designated as the first director general of the board. The combined efforts of the strategists and administrators in the branch and the instructor and technical personnel in the school have steered the organisation through many difficult situations from assisting with flood relief to combating the effects of foot and mouth disease and they deserve our gratitude for developing it to the stage it is at today. The enthusiasm of personnel <Col N="411" /> in the branch in dealing with volunteer members at the school and on various exercises in all parts of the country was a major factor in sustaining the interest of the volunteers in the Civil Defence. It is important that the impetus of this Civil Service expertise should continue and develop in managing the Civil Defence of the future and that the position of director general will be pivotal in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 14 which provides for the board to engage, as appropriate, outside expertise will be an important provision for the development of strategic planning in the organisation. Funding will obviously be of vital importance and provision is made at section 19 for the Minister to provide that funding by way of grant-in-aid to the board from the Defence Vote. This will replace the payment of grants-in-aid from the Department to local authorities and give the board a wide autonomy in determining the distribution of the funding to the various local authorities. There will be no diminution in the funding being made available to the board as compared to the level of funding made available heretofore. As I pointed out earlier the Government is committed to additional funding for Civil Defence. The grant-in-aid will also provide for funding the salary and related costs for the staff of the board.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 contain standard provisions for dealing with gifts and for the accounts of the board to be prepared as appropriate and submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the audited accounts to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In light of ongoing discussions between officials of the Department and the Department of Finance, I may propose an amendment on Committee Stage to delete the provisions contained in sections 23 and 24 of the Bill regarding the accountability of the Secretary General to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees as the obligations contained therein are sufficiently provided for in the Public Service Management Act, 1997 and other legislation.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 25 for the board to make an annual report and other reports to the Minister as he-she may require or as the board may think fit. Section 26 provides for the Minister to give a direction to the board to use, provide or lend equipment as appropriate should the Minister consider it necessary to alleviate a particular situation. Section 27 provides for the board to establish committees of the board, in particular four named committees, to carry out the its work. I have already mentioned the recruitment committee and, for strategic development, the planning and development committee will be vital. However, in so far as the volunteers are concerned the education and training and health, safety and procurement committees will be of most relevance to them.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the importance of training to the Civil Defence but in executing the training and delivering Civil Defence services, the <Col N="412" /> health and safety of the volunteers and staff and their confidence in the equipment they use is of paramount importance if the organisation is to be sustained. Section 29 provides for the board to submit a strategic plan to the Minister setting out its key objectives and strategies to be reviewed every three years. Section 30 provides for each local authority to submit a Civil Defence plan to the board setting out its key objectives and strategies and these plans are intended to form the basis for the board to submit its plan to the Minister under section 29. I am confident that this process of strategic planning and the implementation of these plans will permeate throughout the organisation from management down to the newest recruit, lead to a sense of empowerment at local level and give renewed focus to the overall development of Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>I am providing at sections 33 and 34 for the board to develop its policy for formalising the recruitment and registration process for Civil Defence members. With regard to section 35 and the staffing provisions in the Bill, I have considered this matter further in order to ensure developmental and career opportunities for staff of the board and to allow for a source of new blood. I am also considering introducing an amendment to establish a chief Civil Defence officer who will be a uniformed member.</P>
    <P>Schedule 1 to the Bill provides for the definition of Civil Defence to be identical to that already contained in the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Act, 1998 which gives a broad and internationally recognised definition of the tasks in which the Civil Defence can be involved and, more importantly, allows sufficient scope for the board to develop the organisation into the future.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have had the opportunity to shape and advance the statutory framework for the future development of the Civil Defence. The Bill represents a landmark development in that regard, being the first piece of Civil Defence legislation in over 50 years and I look forward to hearing Deputies' views.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Civil Defence is an organisation of which we see a great deal but know little about. In many respects, its members are unsung heroes whom we take for granted. Despite very small support and funding, somewhere in the region of &euro;5 million last year, the Civil Defence provides excellent value for money. Whether during flood time or the local county show, the many volunteers who make up the force are to be found giving of their time to assist others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Defence was set up in 1950 as part of the national defence structure and as a necessary civil response to potential hazards which might <Col N="413" /> arise in a war situation. It was to operate in a non-combatant role and was afforded partial defence against the effects on persons and property of an attack on the State or other hazards that might arise in a time of war or emergency such as radioactive fallout or biological or chemical warfare. If we are honest, we will acknowledge that little or nothing has been done for the Civil Defence over the past half a century. The organisation has been placed on the back-burner. In a county like Wicklow, with a population of over 100,000 people, there is but one Civil Defence officer answering directly to the county manager, with responsibility for somewhere in the region of 150 volunteers operating within a budget of circa &euro;80,000, out of which a wage must first be taken.</P>
    <P>Many Civil Defence officers rely on local arrangements or the goodwill of the local authority to provide assistance of any description. Morale in many areas has to be low and the miracle is that the organisation has survived it all. The attack of 11 September has given a focus and interest to the group with many new recruits joining. I am aware that in my home county, two new branches have set up in Ballyconnell and Kilcoole in recent months. The Civil Defence operates under legislation that includes the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 and the various local government Acts. The Minister for Defence usually delegates responsibility for the Civil Defence to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. I do not know the reason for this or from where that tradition evolved. It is no reflection on the current Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, who I am sure is very able but the Civil Defence should be the responsibility of the Minister for Defence who should be tasked with responsibility for all emergency planning. The Minister should explain on Committee Stage why he is handing that over. After all, he does not have an onerous brief &ndash; the post has often been joined with that of Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. The Minister might take this on and allow the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, to return to his duties as Government Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence facilitates, through the local authorities, Civil Defence responses for emergency relief and support, ensures the operation of vital services and provides other community supports as directed by Government. It is responsible for policy development and the direction of the volunteer organisation through the local authorities. It also looks after the training, equipping, administration and financing of Civil Defence. Expenditure incurred by local authorities on this group is grant aided to the extent of 70% by the Department of Defence. The Department fully funds capital equipment but, sadly, the inventory makes for poor reading and the equipment is scarce and outdated.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 6,000 members trained in various skills, such as first aid, rescue, fire fighting, land and water search and radiation <Col N="414" /> monitoring. With the end of the Cold War, the principal focus of the 1990s changed to community support and emergency response. This was highlighted with the launch in 1992 of the development programme Towards 2000. This will now be revised and the new board will be able to redefine the aim and focus of the organisation. Despite the many lofty aspirations and aims outlined in various documents and White Papers, these policies have never been followed by the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Defence White Paper in 2000, the Government decided that the Civil Defence mission should be to facilitate, through the local authorities, responses for emergency relief and support, to ensure the operation of vital services and the maintenance of public life and to provide other community supports as directed by the Government. A commitment was given to update the legislation and, thus, we have the Civil Defence Bill, 2002, which provides for the establishment of a Civil Defence board to oversee and supervise the development of the organisation in co-operation with the major emergency services. Funding for the board is by way of grant-in-aid from the Defence Vote.</P>
    <P>Part II, chapter one, the main kernel of the Bill, deals with the establishment of the Civil Defence board, its functions and membership, including the appointment of a director general. The functions of the board, as outlined in section 8, are very detailed. They mirror the role of Civil Defence but it would give a greater sense of purpose to the organisation if its role was defined in Part I of the Bill. The Minister should examine this on Committee Stage. It is referred to in the Schedule but I ask him to consider putting the definition of Civil Defence in the preamble to the Bill. Many Civil Defence members have said to me that they are unclear as to their role or mission.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with membership of the board. The absence of a nominee from the Defence Forces is an omission. I cannot argue with the groups nominated, particularly the volunteer sections, but a member of the Defence Forces would bring expertise and act as a valuable link for the board. The Minister may have an explanation for this omission so I would like to hear it. I am in favour of cross-pollination between groups because it can extend the focus and bring skills from different backgrounds.</P>
    <P>Do we know where the board will meet? Strangely the Minister is not responsible for Civil Defence but he took the decision to relocate it to Roscrea, a difficult place to get to. I would not like to think the composition of the board will be dictated by geography to ensure attendance.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the dreaded consultant. Taking into consideration the role of the Civil Defence, consultants will be queuing to give advice. The board should move slowly and use the knowledge that will be readily available to it through the Civil Defence officers and volunteers, who are experts in many areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" />Sections 15 to 25 deal with membership accountability and ethics. Section 26 deals with equipment, of which the Minister is aware the organisation has a limited pool. Section 27 deals with committees to be established by the board but I cannot see the need for the four committees outlined in the Bill. Perhaps the recruitment and health and safety committees could be amalgamated. Section 29 deals with the strategic planner for the board. Will the Minister assure the House that six months is an adequate timeframe to draw up a plan for a group that has only been established? It may be over ambitious and give rise to a hurried plan. Does the Minister have the power to reject or amend the plan? The Bill states that the Minister may give direction as to what he wants in the plan but can he reject it?</P>
    <P>Section 30 deals with the local authority civil defence plan. Again, I am concerned with the nine month timespan. I assume the plan cannot be dealt with until the strategic plan of the board itself has been completed. In effect, the local authority will only have three months to complete its report. The Bill states that from the date of establishment of the board, the local authority must come forward with its own plan within nine months. There is only one civil defence officer in each local authority, who will not be able to draw up his plan until he finds out the plan of the strategic board, which gives him only three months to draw up a plan.</P>
    <P>Section 33, which is very prescriptive, deals with the production and upkeep of a register. Such details should be left to the board. Section 34 outlines in detail the procedures for keeping the names, addresses and dates of birth of the members. Again, this should not be in the Bill: it should be left up to the board to draw up such regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the Minister has the authority to retake control of the board in time of crisis. Does that refer to the Minister for Defence or the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach? </P>
    <P>Section 13 does not say that the director general must be a permanent civil servant but, according to the Minister's speech, he intends to amend that, and I wonder why. Expertise and fresh thinking from outside the Civil Service could be useful.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence has been a neglected element of our Defence Forces and this Bill has been a long time coming. The Minister of State and his staff have put a great deal of work into it and I commend them for that. It is important that the message goes out to the many volunteers who on weekends, at night and in time of emergency turn up for little or no remuneration. The budget for County Wicklow is &euro;80,000 to pay the Civil Defence officer's wages and meagre expenses to the volunteers. They are also poorly equipped. In the wake of 11 September, we should take Civil Defence more seriously and make an effort to recruit more people. A section of Civil Defence <Col N="416" /> falls under the remit of the Department of Public Enterprise. Perhaps it should all fall under the remit of the Minister for Defence as it does not make sense to split it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this Bill was accelerated by the tragic events of 11 September and it is important that we have responded. If the Bill reinvigorates the Civil Defence it will have been worthwhile. We can see that the age profile of Civil Defence groups in local areas is largely an older one and for that reason every effort should be put into recruitment. The declining numbers can be attributed to the fact that so many control centre facilities are in a poor condition. In my town, Loughrea, the premises from which the Civil Defence unit operates are dilapidated and isolated. From the exterior they appear to be semi-derelict. The budget increase, from &euro;2 million to &euro;5 million, is most welcome and I hope much of it will be used to upgrade existing facilities.</P>
      <P>In County Galway, which the Minister of State knows well, we associate the Civil Defence with specific parts of the region. In areas where there is a tradition of a Civil Defence unit I hope it will remain, but in other areas there is little visible sign of Civil Defence activity. We must target such areas in order to establish a widespread and uniform presence. I hope the Bill will provide the impetus for such an initiative to take place.</P>
      <P>Current and past members of the Civil Defence are to be complimented for having generously and voluntarily given of their time over the years. They have played a crucial role in saving lives and providing backup to the emergency services at football and hurling matches and other such events. Were it not for the presence of the Civil Defence members there would be no emergency cover and so we must show our appreciation of their loyal presence and dedication at public events all year round.</P>
      <P>With a national membership of 6,000, there is room for large scale recruitment, especially among the younger generation. With proper guidance, young people are only too willing to channel their energy and enthusiasm into positive things such as the Civil Defence. School leavers should be encouraged to join the Civil Defence, even for a short period, thus benefiting from the training, expertise and discipline involved. I am not advocating conscription but such membership should be encouraged through the education system. There is a civic responsibility to join Civil Defence units and enormous potential could be tapped among the young. Once the seed of commitment has been sown it will bear fruit, with young people remaining on to become life-long members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays, there are many distractions for young people who are seeking activities such as those provided by service within the Civil Defence. When we see so many tragic instances of young people becoming involved in crime, along with crime victims in their own peer group, <Col N="417" /> we can appreciate the importance of an organisation such as the Civil Defence in channelling young people's energy in a productive way. I hope the Minister will be able to make progress in that regard; it would certainly be rewarding if that were to happen.</P>
    <P>The headquarters of the Civil Defence has been decentralised to Roscrea and, thus, the concept of decentralisation, which appeared to have been forgotten by the Government, has been reactivated. Many people were looking forward to decentralisation of various Departments and agencies to rural areas but at least the idea has been renewed in this case. As Government Chief Whip, will the Minister of State enlighten us as to whether this move is the thin end of the wedge? In the coming weeks and months will other decentralisation plans be announced? East Galway should be recognised for some such decentralisation programme. I welcome the courage of the Minister for Defence in acquiring the Civil Defence headquarters for Roscrea. I hope other decentralisation projects will follow rapidly in its wake.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill along with the increased budgetary provision, the Minister should draw up an inventory of all Civil Defence facilities and equipment in order to see how the organisation can be modernised. A new image would make the Civil Defence more attractive and could increase its membership. It would also have a greater relevance, although I do not wish to take from the excellent effort, endeavour, and commitment of the existing members. The Bill could provide the impetus for a greater voluntary organisation to emerge in support of other statutory agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Bill is long overdue, I welcome it. It will shock many people to learn that the legislation governing the Civil Defence was enacted during the Second World War &ndash; namely, the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946. Legislation that is more than 60 years old is hardly sufficient to provide for the exigencies of the modern Civil Defence. The principle underlying the establishment of the Civil Defence board is sound and I welcome the Minister's proposal that the relevant issues will in future be dealt with by the new board instead of his Department. The board will oversee, supervise and co-ordinate the operations and future development of the Civil Defence in co-operation with the emergency services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over many decades, the Civil Defence has all too often been taken for granted. As a mainly voluntary body it has shown great devotion to augmenting the work of the Garda Síochána and the emergency services, without remuneration. People around the country are conscious of the presence of Civil Defence units that operate at public events, including football matches, by directing traffic in support of the gardaí and carrying out other duties. How often do we think of the time and voluntary effort its members con<Col N="418" /> tribute for the public good? Not very often, I suspect. It can be a thankless job and, at times, a well nigh invisible one. I congratulate all the members of the Civil Defence in my area of Kildare, as well as the adjacent counties, for the efforts they have made over a long period in attending various public events.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday week I watched as the Kildare group searched the River Barrow for a missing person. It used its expertise to ensure that the operation was successful while, at the same time, helping to alleviate the concerns of the local people and members of the family of the deceased. The Civil Defence group in my area is always well prepared and well presented when it participates in shows and parades and I compliment Larry Coughlan and his staff. They do a marvellous job efficiently and without any fuss and they are part of many great occasions in Kildare. People expect to see them at events and know that they will be in safe hands. They undertake logistical duties and are skilled in life saving. They often use their expertise in sad circumstances, as I witnessed last week.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Civil Defence is to be upgraded and revamped under this Bill and that its members will have a designated board to represent their interests and oversee and co-ordinate their activities. I congratulate the Minister in relation to the constitution of the board. I debated the constitution of the board of the Irish Red Cross Society with the Minister for Defence. The staff of the Red Cross were not represented on the board of the society and the Minister for Defence agreed to put a staff representative on the board. The Civil Defence board will include a staff representative and a voluntary member representative so that Civil Defence members will have access to it. Deputy Timmins asked that a member of staff from the Department of Defence should sit on the board and I support that proposal. I hope the Minister will consider it on Committee Stage or when the constitution of the board is being considered.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence was instituted in 1950 as part of the national defence structure and as a necessary response to potential hazards which might arise in a war situation. In the aftermath of 11 September, that prospect is more likely than it might have been when the Civil Defence was first established. One of the principal functions envisaged for the Civil Defence during the 1950s was to deal with hazards from nuclear, biological or radioactive fallout. At that time people wondered why we needed a Civil Defence organisation, but the events of 11 September changed everything.</P>
    <P>I will not go into detail about the Government's somewhat retarded approach to the possibility of fallout from Sellafield, but I wish to stress to the Minister and to the House the importance of the role of the Civil Defence in such an event. I ask if the Civil Defence is being given adequate training and instruction to deal with biological warfare, given the increasing sophistication which <Col N="419" /> bio-terrorists display in their campaigns of violence and terror.</P>
    <P>I am aware that all members of the Civil Defence are well trained in various skills such as first aid, rescue, emergency feeding, care of evacuees, land and water search and radiation monitoring. However, it is important the Minister assures the House that the new board to be established under this Bill will ensure, bearing Sellafield in mind, that current and prospective Civil Defence members are fully trained to cope with nuclear fallout and its consequences.</P>
    <P>In response to a parliamentary question on this legislation that I tabled to the Minister for Defence last October, he said that under the national plan for nuclear accidents, which is still under review, the role of the Department is to arrange to have an effective civil defence organisation that is trained and in a position to respond to requests for assistance from the Radiological Protection Institute and other emergency services and to monitor radiation levels. I hope the Bill will give the Civil Defence the adequate training and information necessary to do this work.</P>
    <P>The trojan work undertaken on a regular basis by Civil Defence was demonstrated by the efforts of the Kerry Mountain Rescue Service which rescued those involved in a tragic accident in the Kerry mountains in early January. As a result of the accident, the Defence Forces lost a great advocate and spokesperson in John Lucey. I offer my deepest sympathies and those of the Labour Party to the Lucey family and to PDFORRA on that terrible loss. Great credit and praise is due to the members of the Kerry Mountain Rescue Service who dealt with that tragedy with great skill and dedication. The incident highlighted the tireless voluntary commitment and time given by civil defence forces such as the mountain rescue service.</P>
    <P>Another example of the wonderful work of civil defence forces is river rescue. The Kildare group is to be congratulated on its efforts two weeks ago. My party has called for more support and funding for such organisations. The river rescue group provides a vital service throughout the country. The volunteers involved receive no State funding at present and are forced to rely on fund-raising to keep operational. In this day and age vital bodies such as these should not have to rely on fundraising on street corners. I hope that under chapter one, section 19, which provides for the funding of the board, some consideration will be given to providing the necessary financial resources to river and mountain rescue services. I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for granting additional funding to the mountain rescue service in Kerry. I hope that a future Government will continue to support groups such as this.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence is maintained at a very modest cost to the State while maintaining a voluntary ethos that is second to none. I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will elaborate on the <Col N="420" /> details of the funding to be provided to the Civil Defence. I welcome that the definition of the Civil Defence is to be made identical to that already provided in the Geneva Convention (Amendment) Act, 1998. I hope that the Minister will elaborate on the proposal in the Bill that each local authority must provide the Civil Defence board with a three year development plan and include certain information relating to Civil Defence in its annual report. This was mentioned by other speakers.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority and I wonder how this report will be determined and whether the chief Civil Defence officer in each local authority will have an input.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting yesterday with my county manager when he referred to a number of relevant reports my local authority must consider. Now another report will be required. It puts major pressure on local authorities, including members and staff. The number of reports required is causing a huge amount of paperwork and I hope the Minister of State will indicate how local authorities are to be expected to deal with this. This provision calls for a report within a six month period, to be reviewed every three years. Many local authorities could not do that, even within five years. While there will be much repetitive work, I doubt if a three year requirement is necessary. Will the Minister of State comment on this and will he confirm if the report has to be passed by local authority members? Counties Kildare, Wicklow, Carlow, Laois, Offaly and Dublin are border counties for the purpose of this provision. How will the different reports be co-ordinated? Despite these reservations, I welcome the provision as it should allow for greater cohesion and co-operation between the Civil Defence and local authorities.</P>
    <P>A worrying trend in the Civil Defence is the decline in the number of members in the force and the rise in the age profile. This bodes ill for the future and I hope the trend will be arrested by the establishment of the committees provided for in the Bill. Perhaps four committees will be too many. I see little point in having a committee for recruitment and for training. Unless they are merged the recruitment committee will not be able to monitor the development of recruits. I ask the Minister to reconsider this. How will these committees be constituted? Will they form part of the remit of the Civil Defence group in each area or what part will local authorities play?</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to undertake a recruitment campaign. On many occasions I have urged the Minister for Defence to utilise the education system, even at primary level. The Bill provides for this. The workings of the Civil Defence need to be explained at all education levels. The voluntary sector will only be restored to its former vitality when its work is more widely explained. Last year I attended numerous meetings to mark events celebrating the year of the volunteer. Regrettably, the same faces attended most meet<Col N="421" /> ings. It reminded me of my involvement in the GAA when I surveyed the annual returns from all the clubs in County Kildare. Often there would not even be four new faces. The present generation is not as committed to voluntary work. They can only become interested enough to be involved if the education system is used to explain what the voluntary sector does. The new Civil Defence structures provided for the Bill will help in this regard.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill. It is a necessary measure and I look forward to improving its provisions on Committee and Report Stages. In the meantime I hope the Minster of State will reflect on this debate and introduce proposals to improve the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>I welcome the Bill. It provides us with the opportunity to express our appreciation to those involved in Civil Defence throughout the country. The Minister of State has consulted widely and his efforts reflect the important role the Civil Defence plays.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has worked closely with the Wexford Civil Defence Association and he will be familiar with its concerns about placing the headquarters in Roscrea. The association considers it to be a distant location, especially by comparison with the headquarters at the Phoenix Park, which is closer to the south-east. The association always received a good service from these headquarters.</P>
      <P>The Civil Defence was established in 1950 to be part of the national defence structure. It has changed much since then and the fact that we have a modern Civil Defence force is a great credit to those in the 1950s and 1960s who operated under very difficult circumstances, with very little equipment by comparison with what is available today. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get people to volunteer and a recruitment drive is essential, although the head of the section in Wexford, Gabrielle Willis, is in charge of a thriving organisation. I recently attended an award function and noted that there was a good mix of younger and older people, including women. It is good to see an organisation with such a mix play an important role in the community.</P>

    <P>A board membership of 12 is more than adequate. It will be broadly based, with members taken from industry, commerce and other sections of the community. The modern expertise of business people will be important. The Minister of State stated clearly that people who become a Member of the Oireachtas or a county council must opt off the board. I often wonder about that decision, particularly in relation to county councillors who are very much involved in their communities. A county manager or some bureaucrat from the county council can become a member of a board but the local politician is always excluded. A common feature of every Bill that comes before this House lately is that a decision is taken that a politician cannot become <Col N="422" /> a member of a board. One would think politicians were some kind of monsters who were not capable of making decisions in the interests of their communities, yet they work 16 or 17 hours a day in this House and at national level on behalf of those communities. Will the Minister of State explain the reason politicians have to be excluded from this board and, it would appear, from every board that is appointed, regardless of which Government is in power?</P>
    <P>I want to recognise the role of Civil Defence in Wexford which has made a tremendous contribution to the community over many years. Its members are very active in the community and they have won many awards throughout the country. As Deputy Wall said, whether it is a GAA match or any other type of community activity, the Civil Defence is to the fore. From early April up to the end of the year, they were involved in every major function and event in County Wexford, including the tour of the relics of St. Therese. During the foot and mouth disease outbreak, all the operations of the Civil Defence had to cease and its members were very disappointed because they had to miss a number of functions.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence was in attendance on a voluntary basis at the opening of the Dunbrody Famine Ship, the official opening of the Hook lighthouse and the official opening of the new Wexford quayside by the Taoiseach. I sometimes wonder how they find the time to attend these functions. Great credit is due to the employers who allow their employees to take time off work to be involved in these activities. It is important that we continue to encourage employers to be as generous as possible so that their staff can become actively involved in the Civil Defence. The training is excellent, and that is important for young people. It includes discipline training and the way communities work. It also gives them an active role in their communities and a sense of playing their part in helping people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall referred to the mountain rescue service. Last year there were unfortunate cases of people falling into rivers and the Civil Defence became involved, searching the river banks, working with relatives and generally playing their part. It was comforting to see their activities and those of the Red Cross who also helped out.</P>
    <P>The need for a permanent building in Wexford has been a bone of contention there for a long time, and I am aware that Gabrielle Willis has discussed it with the Minister of State on a number of occasions. Some Deputies mentioned earlier that the premises from which the Civil Defence operates do not meet the required standard. That is a difficulty throughout the country. There may not be a need to build new buildings but there is a need to lease modern buildings for the Civil Defence. I am aware that a new premises has been rented in Kent Manufacturing in Wexford and that the Department has paid the leasing costs on the building, which is welcome. If one stop shops are built by local authorities in <Col N="423" /> future, perhaps Civil Defence offices could be part and parcel of them.</P>
    <P>Funding of the Civil Defence is currently made up of 70% from the Department and 30% from the local authority. Will the Minister of State consider increasing the funding from the Department in the future, particularly for ambulances and other equipment that is required?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a new board will be set up and I hope that will be done as soon as possible so that we can get on with improving the services provided by the Civil Defence. The people are available but we need a new recruitment drive through the schools, industry and commerce to encourage more young people to become involved. The Civil Defence provides a worthwhile service to the community and it is very much appreciated by the community at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think of Civil Defence in the same vein as credit unions and other community services which are so important. I want to add my voice to those who congratulated the men and women who make up Civil Defence on the multiplicity of activities in which they are involved.</P>
      <P>Civil Defence is like everything that is good: we take it for granted. We never ask about its policies, etc. as long as it is there when we need it. Its members are present wherever people congregate, be it sports events or on occasions of natural disasters, including floods. I have seen them in action in Gort, County Galway over the years and they were magnificent but, strangely, when those calamities pass we forget about the people who helped. That is why I congratulate the Minister on bringing the legislation governing Civil Defence up to present day standards.</P>
      <P>On the age profile of members of Civil Defence, some members have told me that once their service comes to an end, there are not a sufficient number of people available to fill their shoes. We are talking about a membership of 6,000, which is huge by any standards. It is important that Civil Defence gets a new image and I hope that will be the effect of what the Minister of State is trying to do. Civil Defence has to be seen for what it is &ndash; a community based organisation which exists for a variety of good reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Civil Defence was called on to do in the past is likely to be entirely different from what it might have to do in the future. I would like to see a core of 6,000, 8,000 or 10,000 highly trained <Col N="424" /> people who could turn their hands to a range of problems and calamities. The acid test of the Minister of State's legislation will be the way the various bodies react to the new situation.</P>
    <P>I spent part of my life working in youth organisations and an important element in attracting young people into such organisations is that they believe it is the trendy thing to do. I do not know what young people think of Civil Defence, but there are ways and means of ensuring that it appeals to them. Deputy Wall made some sensible suggestions in his contribution. The message of the ethos and principle behind civil defence should be conveyed to second level schools and third level colleges. If an interest in the Civil Defence were ignited among third level students, that could have a major impact in this area as they will graduate as professionals in a few years. One need only consider the effort many third level students put into their work with groups such as the Samaritans. I know that from the work done by my children as they went through college. They get excited about such matters for a few years. The Civil Defence should be one of these and should get its share of the limelight. A different approach to this matter might also be taken at primary level.</P>
    <P>It is easy to make a connection with the Civil Defence in most parishes. I doubt in the course of a year if a single person in County Galway would not see some of the work done by the Civil Defence. They might not know why it was done or who was doing it, but they see the service in action.</P>
    <P>I note what is proposed in the Bill in terms of the relationship between the Civil Defence and local authorities. I hope the relationship between Civil Defence units and the county council will be built on a sound foundation. I would like the Minister of State to indicate the nature of employment and amount of remuneration a Civil Defence officer charged with responsibility in this area will be given. A person who takes on such a role, which is an important one, would have a major impact for better or worse on how well the organisation works in a county. The person appointed would need to have great enthusiasm for this type of work and be able to tout for business. That is an important element, given that if an emergency were to arise and we had 6,000 to 10,000 highly trained and motivated people in this organisation, they could make a major difference in saving people's lives.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State on what he is doing. I notice that last year the organisation was given an additional cash injection of &euro;635 million. It has been represented to me that there is a major financial deficit in Civil Defence. Much of its equipment is old. It is time the organisation was given a financial boost. More financial resources should be made available to give it the image I would like it to have, but that would involve the expenditure of a fair bit more money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to say how much I value what Members had to say on this Bill. What I heard reminds me of the value of the Second Stage debate on legislation. One gets to listen carefully to what is said. Some useful ideas have been put forward, which I will carefully examine to ascertain if they can be accommodated on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Interesting questions, to which perhaps I had not given sufficient thought, were raised and I will now consider these. Deputy Timmins asked me about the requirement to have a civil servant as director general of the organisation and whether that requirement should be opened up. That is a suggestion I will consider. He also asked about the need to have four committees of the organisation and whether that requirement might be rationalised. I will also closely examine that suggestion. He proposed the inclusion of a military person on the board and I will examine this between now and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ulick Burke, like Deputy Timmins, paid tribute to the work of the members of the Civil Defence and saluted their dedication and commitment, a tribute in which, I am sure, we would all join. He also pointed out the importance of having a recruitment campaign. I specifically included in the Bill a recruitment requirement. We need to ensure there is a gender balance in the organisation. One of the reasons I came up with the idea of appointing a board was to enable it to appoint officers, board members or staff to specifically take on the full-time job of recruiting members through a public relations campaign in a structured way, which the organisation did not have an opportunity to do in the past.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wall rightly pointed out that it is 50 years since we legislated for the Civil Defence. Deputy Connaughton made the point that one does not hear the Civil Defence debated in this House often, the reason being that the last legislation on Civil Defence before this House was introduced 50 years ago. It is long past time that we modernised that legislation. Deputy Wall congratulated the volunteers on their work and supported the idea of having a Department of Defence military person on the board, a suggestion which I will examine. I join in Deputy Wall's expression of sympathy to the family of the late John Lucey of PDFORRA who made a wonderful contribution to the organisation and to Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wall asked me about the need for a three year plan for the organisation and the logistics of how that would work. I will return to that point on Committee Stage. The Deputy is right in that the last thing we need is for the organisation to become too bureaucratic. Perhaps a simpler version of that plan, outlining clear goals, which could be set out on a few sheets of paper would be a good deal better than a massive strategic plan. I am sure we can marry the two ideas. Deputy Wall asked about the requirement to <Col N="426" /> have four committees and suggested that perhaps two could be amalgamated, which is a proposal I will consider.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Browne raised the views of members of the Civil Defence in Wexford. He knows I am well aware of those views, which he has brought to my attention on many occasions, as has the local organisation. I note what he said about the building situation there and I will examine the matter. I endorse his view that there is a need for more women in the organisation. While that position has improved dramatically, much more could be done, particularly with the appointment of a specialised recruitment committee. Perhaps the board would appoint a specialised recruitment officer who would deal with public relations and recruitment.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for emphasising the community orientation of the Civil Defence. I hope this Bill will be an exciting new start for a wonderful organisation. We know it needs better facilities, more equipment, improved buildings, but most of all it needs a new start. Without taking from the great work done by everybody involved at every level over the years, at the start of a new millennium and a new century I hope we can reinvigorate the organisation and give it a new board, on which the volunteers can have a direct say. Together they can plan the future of what is a fantastic organisation. The volunteers are the unsung heroes in our community. I hope the new board and organisation will give the Civil Defence a fresh start of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for the speedy but thoughtful and constructive passage of the Second Stage of this Bill. I look forward to teasing out its provisions and responding in more detail to the Deputies' questions on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated number of assaults causing harm reported to An Garda Síochána in 2001; the estimated number of other assaults so reported; the number of such assaults in each category to date in 2002; and the reason he has failed to take appropriate action to prevent the continuing escalation of violence on streets.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6178/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, on the basis of contact with the Garda authorities, that although they are not in a position at this stage to produce statistics for the year 2001 that someone is prepared to stand over, the likelihood is that there will be some positives as well as some negatives in them.</P>
      <P>With regard to preliminary crime figures <i>per se,</i> I remind the House that no Minister for Justice, to the best of my knowledge, has ever published such figures, as provided by the Garda Síochána. The reason which has always been given for this is that preliminary figures are almost invariably subject to adjustment. As a case in point, the final statistics produced in the Garda Annual Report, 2000 showed significant departures from preliminary information that had been gathered during the year. Prudence dictates, therefore, that one should await the officially published figures.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that crime statistics for the year 2001 are currently undergoing the routine process of validation in Garda districts. I am further informed that this work will not be completed for some time, so it is not possible for me to provide an indicative date for publication at this stage. I am assured that when the compilation process is completed and the report printed, copies will be forwarded to me by the Garda authorities without delay.</P>
      <P>At this point, I utterly and categorically reject the suggestion by the Deputy that my response to the incidence of assault has been anything but rapid, committed and well resourced. However, it is important to make the point that law enforcement, while having a crucial role in dealing with the problem, cannot be said to be the sole or ultimate kind of solution to deal with the propensity of some people &ndash; and, particularly, some young men &ndash; towards violence.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in terms of the law enforcement response, the Garda Síochána's national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, has been in operation since October 2000. This operation focuses on public disorder, public intoxication, under age drinking, illicit drug use and under age alcohol sales. &lsquo;Hotspots' of criminal activity receive particular Garda attention, with an emphasis on high-visibility patrolling. Moreover, key urban locations are selected for intensive patrolling involving the Garda mounted unit, Garda dog unit and Garda air support unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider Operation Oíche to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction, there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and night clubs. This operation has taken place against the background of the unprecedented investment <Col N="428" /> which the Government has made in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The number of gardaí has now increased from 10,800 in 1997 to more than 11,700 at present, and it is on target to achieve a strength of 12,000 by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>The Garda Síochána Vote for the year 2002 is &euro;918 million, £723 million, which represents an increase of more than 50 per cent on 1997 levels.</P>
    <P>A further significant measure against violent street crime is Garda CCTV. To date, CCTV systems have been installed in Dublin North Central, i.e., O'Connell Street and its surrounding areas, Dublin South Central, i.e., Grafton Street and its surrounding areas and Tralee, County Kerry. A Garda CCTV system is currently nearing completion in Cork city, and I understand that most of the cameras in the system are now fully operational.</P>
    <P>In late 2000, I announced that the number of Garda CCTV systems was to be further expanded, and I have allocated more than &euro;15 million for expenditure in this area for the period 2001 to 2003. Garda town centre CCTV systems are now planned for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Galway, Limerick, Athlone and Waterford. Moreover, the installation of systems in at least a further six areas will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>I have also recently sought and received Government approval for the drafting &ndash; on a priority basis &ndash; of a new Criminal Justice (Public Order Enforcement) Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to tackle anti-social behaviour. It will target drunk and unruly elements who congregate late at night outside or in the vicinity of licensed and other premises, such as fast food outlets, and who by their aggressive and intimidating behaviour threaten the peace and well-being of law-abiding citizens. As announced in the Government's legislation programme on 29 January, 2002, it is planned that the Bill will be published before Easter.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will continue to do all that is necessary to effectively tackle the problem of assault and violence on our streets, and I am confident that existing measures are paying and will continue to pay dividends in terms of crime prevention and detection.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that based on the Garda crime statistics for 2000 there are 30 victims of assault per day throughout the country? Is he aware there are 211 victims of assault per week on our streets? Is he aware that as we raise this issue this afternoon there are two young men still unconscious in the same ward in Cork University Hospital as a consequence of horrific assaults perpetrated on them in Cork city centre? Is he aware there are other young men in Dublin hospitals as a result of assaults perpetrated on them? Is he aware of the number of assaults that <Col N="429" /> took place in 2001? Will he confirm that the 131% increase in assaults causing harm between 1999 and 2000 is not the end of the matter and that there has been a further substantial increase in the incidence of assault in 2001? If the Minister does not have estimated figures for 2001, will he explain what has gone wrong with the PULSE computer system which was designed to ensure that both he and the Garda Síochána had immediate access to up-to-date statistics about crime such as assaults, so as to plan policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there is a problem on the streets in relation to violent assaults. I am also aware that the 131% increase referred to by Deputy Shatter relates to serious offences &ndash; assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The number of serious assaults rose between 1999 and 2000 from 700 odd to 1,700 odd. The other assaults to which the Deputy refers clearly relate to common assaults which would be less serious. We must put this in perspective. The number of serious assaults in the region of 1,700 and more for the year 2000 is obviously a cause for concern. It is in that context that Operation Oíche was put in place. It is in that context also that we have provided CCTV cameras at four different locations and are proceeding to provide ten more and a further six will be announced in due course. We hope in the not too distant future to announce a scheme of grants for CCTV schemes in places having a lower priority.</P>
      <P>The Garda has never been better resourced than it is now. Since 1997 its budget has been increased by more than 50%. We have put in place more than 42 Bills in this and the other House. The number of gardaí has been increased to 11,700 and the Garda Síochána is on target to achieve a strength of 12,000. We have also increased the number of prison spaces.</P>
      <P>We have tackled many elements of crime. Overall, crime has fallen by approximately 27% since the Government came to office. I acknowledge there is a problem on the streets in relation to serious assaults. That is a matter which has to be tackled from a criminal justice perspective but it is also a problem which has to be measured from a societal perspective. We have to look at the reasons for these assaults and seek to tackle them at source.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner is gravely concerned that any doubt should be cast on the accuracy of information which may form part of his Garda Annual Report, arising from allegations relating to the treatment of crime statistics for 2001 in Waterford city Garda district, as contained in <i>The Star </i>newspaper last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence, on 14 February the Commissioner appointed a chief superintendent from <Col N="431" /> outside the region to review all aspects of the information received. Specifically, the chief superintendent will carry out a complete audit of all headline and applicable non-headline offences in the Garda District in question for 2001. The audit will examine all detected offences and the evidence pertaining to those offences being declared as detected. It will also examine compliance with the crime counting rules as they currently apply.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of the figures contained in the Commissioner's annual report on crime, I assure the House that the report of the chief superintendent, when finalised, will be made public.</P>
    <P>I very much share the concern of the Deputy that these allegations have arisen. Although I have no role and do not intervene in the compilation of crime statistics, it should go without saying that public confidence must be upheld in the validity and legitimacy of crime statistics emanating from the organisation solely responsible for their compilation, namely, the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>However, it must also be recognised that the crimes which are the subject matter of this controversy occurred in 2001 and that the Commissioner's Annual Report of An Garda Síochána for that year has yet to be finalised. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the process of validating crime figures for the year 2001 is at present under way in all Garda districts and that it will not be completed for some time yet. Nevertheless, I have been assured that as soon as the work is finalised, the validated statistics will be compiled into report form and printed copies forwarded to me with the utmost speed.</P>

      <P>I remind the House that the allegations being discussed now relate to 14 alleged incidents in one Garda district, out of a total of 107 Garda districts. I consider it to be grossly unfair and empirically unwarranted to make the leap from the specific to the general, and any attempt to do so does a disservice to the men and women of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Jumping the gun and presuming a general culture of wrongdoing by the Garda in the absence of empirical findings not only runs counter to the principles of natural justice, but it is a gross breach of our duty to maintain a reasoned, balanced and fair analysis of issues that may arise from time to time in the sphere of crime and law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>As to the question of the degree of retrospection of the investigation being conducted by the chief superintendent, that Garda officer has been <Col N="432" /> directed by the Garda Commissioner to complete his investigation as soon as possible and to include recommendations, where considered appropriate. I am confident that further action on foot of any recommendations, including the possibility of auditing crime statistics for the Garda district in question prior to 2001, should that be so recommended, will be taken.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the only organisation currently involved in the compilation of Garda crime statistics is the Garda Síochána. In fact, compared to many &ndash; if not most &ndash; statistical indicators of socio-economic matters, the Garda Reports on crime constitute one of the longest-running statistical series in this State. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that a serious case has been made for the type of change referred to by the Deputy, that is, giving a role to the Central Statistics Office in the compilation of crime statistics.</P>
    <P>To give credit where credit is due, the CSO has proven its worth when it comes to crime-related statistical matters, in the form of the 1998 crime and victimisation module of its quarterly national household survey. The Deputy will be aware that this module essentially consisted of a nationwide crime victimisation survey that, in terms of its scope and extent, represented the most extensive survey of its kind ever conducted in this jurisdiction. The CSO itself considers this to have been probably the largest and most complex of its modules conducted and published to date.</P>
    <P>This achievement is a far cry from constituting an argument that the CSO should take over responsibility for the compilation of Garda crime figures. Such a compilation process is not simply a statistical exercise but requires an extensive knowledge of criminal justice legislation and Garda procedures. It is not obvious to me, therefore, that the CSO is the right organisation for the job, and it would require a considerable body of argumentation to convince me that the pre-existing expertise of the Garda Síochána in crime matters is not a considerable advantage in the compilation of crime statistics.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that the National Crime Council, in its first report, entitled Crime in Ireland, made a recommendation that an expert group should be established to, among other matters, examine the collation of information relating to crimes reported to and recorded by the Garda Síochána, mindful of the capabilities of the Garda PULSE computer system.</P>
    <P>At the time of the publication of the report, namely, November 2001, I indicated I would give full and early consideration to this and other recommendations, in conjunction with relevant State agencies, including the Garda Síochána. I would consider that there is a great deal of merit in this proposal, and the associated deliberative process is nearing a conclusion. I expect to be in a position to inform the National Crime Council in the near future of my decision in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" />To return to the main issue here, there is no doubt that the allegations in the newspaper article are serious, but they are not and cannot be used to denigrate a record of achievement second to none in the field of criminal justice. The allegations are being investigated closely and with alacrity, and the results of the investigation will be made public by the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all that can be done is being done, and it is now time to await due process.</P>

      <QRef>[6154/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first like to state clearly and definitively that neither I nor my Department has a role in the compilation and validation of crime statistics, as published in Garda annual reports, including the 2000 report, the most recent in the series. The Garda Síochána changed the system of crime presentation in the year 2000 as part of the PULSE information technology project. Specifically, the changeover to the PULSE platform allowed the Garda to reorganise its crime classification system to more accurately reflect the complex modern criminal activities reported or known to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" />The previous crime classifications and sub-categorisations, based essentially on the distinction between indictable and non-indictable offences, were quite old and increasingly unsuitable. There has been an unprecedented amount of change in criminal law in the last ten years, with new criminal offences being created by approximately 40 statutes in the 1990s. These legislative developments presented a significant challenge to the Garda Síochána in the presentation of crime statistics. The computer system in use prior to the introduction of PULSE was capable of counting these new and modified offences, but lacked the flexibility required to show them as separate entities in the crime statistics. For example, as separate heading for stalking and harassment offences could not be shown in previous annual reports, they were counted and shown as other indictable offences. PULSE proved a considerable improvement in this respect, and the new classification of headline offences contains ten subdivisions which offer a comprehensive description of modern criminal activity in a much more readily understandable form.</P>
    <P>Certain examples illustrate the need for caution in comparing statistics generated by PULSE and previous crime statistics. Much has been made, for example, about the exclusion of criminal damage offences from the headline offence category. Such offences were previously categorised as indictable crime, but the conclusions drawn about the fact that they are now in the non-headline category are wide of the mark. The advice I have received from the Garda authorities is that, prior to the availability of the PULSE system, a significant percentage of criminal damage offences simply did not feature in the statistics. Had they been included, they would have been categorised as non-indictable. The argument, therefore, that 10,000 offences, a proportion of which would be criminal damage, have been moved from the headline to the non-headline offence category simply does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>It should also be stated that crime counting rules have remained unchanged throughout the transition to PULSE. These rules are long established in Ireland and many European counties and relate to the manner in which members of the Garda Síochána count crimes. As an example of a crime counting rule, the so-called primary offence rule states that where two or more criminal offences are disclosed in a single episode, it is the primary criminal offence that is counted. For instance, in a single episode where a person commits a burglary and kills a person in the building, the episode counts as one murder in the crime statistics, even though details of the two offences are recorded. Changes in the compilation of crime statistics in the 2000 Garda annual report, therefore, primarily refer to the manner of pres<Col N="436" /> entation of data, not to willed changes in recording practice.</P>
    <P>I add that all Garda crime figures, prior to their publication, are subject to review and validation in accordance with internal Garda procedures. I am assured by the Garda authorities that the most recently published statistics, as contained in the Garda annual report for 2000, underwent this checking stage and there is no evidence available to me to call into question the overall accuracy of the Garda Commissioner's crime report for 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister surprise the House by answering the question he has been asked? Does he stand over the accuracy of the Garda crime statistics for the year 2000? Will he confirm to the House that he has relied on those statistics to proclaim his heroic status in the fight against crime? Does he consider the contents of the 2000 annual report to be comprehensive and accurate? Will he tell us the basis on which he has reason to believe that the practices that have come to public notice as applying to the collation of statistics in the south east, particularly Waterford, were not applied in the year 2000 in order to understate the crime statistics or overstate the success of detection? If the Minister does stand over the crime statistics, will he explain the reason a column of the 2000 report records that nobody committed for trial was still awaiting trial at the end of the year, despite the fact that there were thousands of such cases in previous years? Why were eight murders in Limerick said to have occurred in Galway? As there is a variety of other such inaccuracies, does the Minister stand over the annual report? If not, will he tell us what he intends to do about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same answer that I received on 12 December. It is clear that no progress has been made on one of the most important measures which affect this society and for which the Minister is responsible, namely, the prohibition of incitement to racial hatred. People are being attacked on our streets, a Chinese citizen has died and this week a case in Cork involved a woman who cannot conceive children because of a racial attack.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a report published by Amnesty International on racism in Ireland which states that a review of the legislation is urgently needed and that the Minister has sat on this review for years? It also states that of all non-nationals polled the level of racist intimidation and attacks are alarmingly high. A total of 78% of those polled have experienced racism and 80% agree that racism is a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had been allowed to finish I would have advised the Deputy of the reason this matter is taking longer than he might wish. We must take account of developments at European level. A Council framework decision was published last November, but we were under the impression that it was going to be published for some time before that.</P>
      <P>We have to await final agreement on the text of the framework decision which may be some months away before we will be in position to fully assess its implications for our legislation and the review already under way. The final text of the protocol to the Council of Europe convention on cybercrime will also have to be considered in the context of the legislative review. That protocol is expected to be finalised before the end of April 2002.</P>
      <P>The issue of racism on the Internet had been left over from the discussion on the cybercrime convention because of the difficult issues involved. I could hardly be expected to move unilaterally on an issue as important as this. I have to take account of movement within the EU. In that respect it is true, and I have said so on a number of occasions, that the Incitement to Hatred Act, as presently constituted, is not sufficient to deal with the problem. There has been an increase in the number of prosecutions. I understand that there have been about five such prosecutions, but I accept that this figure is too low. There is a problem with the legislation and we are moving ahead with a public awareness campaign on racism. I assure Deputy Howlin that this matter is being treated extremely seriously, but we must take account of what is happening at European level before we can finally decide on the shape of our legislation into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister accepting that we have a serious problem with racism, that there is no specific racist offence in Irish law and that no <Col N="441" /> legislation will be introduced before the next election to combat this glaring anomaly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act deals with the whole question of racism. During the lifetime of this Dáil I introduced more legislation in this area than any of my predecessors. We introduced the Employment Equality Act on which the previous Minister, former Deputy Mervyn Taylor, worked hard. We also introduced the Equal Status Act which deals with discrimination against individuals in terms of employment and the provision of services. We were in a position to ratify the UN convention on all forms of racism because we had these legislative provisions in place.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Howlin's comment that more is required. I fully accept that there is a need to update the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, but I cannot do so unilaterally. As to whether or not there is widespread racism, it is not something which I believe is endemic in the Irish people. Some people are certainly inclined to racism and might even be racist. I do not doubt that, but such people are in the minority. The dispersal, for example, of asylum seekers across the country resulted in general terms in a very good welcome which is proof that racism is not rampant.</P>

What is he doing to ensure that staff in the forensic science laboratory do not commence industrial action on 4 March? Can he confirm that there are over 10,000 cases regarding which materials and other matters await analysis which are currently outstanding in the laboratory, 5,000 of which have been outstanding for over six months, 9,000 of <Col N="442" /> which relate to drugs offences and 1,000 of which relate to other offences including murder and manslaughter? Will he confirm that should this industrial action take place, its effect will be that the Garda will be deprived of essential backup assistance, prosecutions will be delayed and investigations will be disrupted? Will he acknowledge that the manner in which he has dealt with this issue indicates complete and total gross incompetence in undertaking his duties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the word &ldquo;incompetent&rdquo; has tripped lightly off the Deputy's tongue in the past week. Members of the Garda have been singularly successful in drugs seizures in recent times. In this context the work of the laboratory has increased dramatically. I take the opportunity to pay the warmest possible tribute to the, in the main, young men and women of the national drugs unit. They have been an outstanding success and they are a tribute to the force as they would be to any police force in the world.</P>
      <P>There are arrears due to the circumstances I outlined. These are in the chemistry section, the biology section and the drugs section. Over the last three years, 27,280 cases have been received and a total of 8,914 cases are awaiting analysis. Of those, 6,963 were received in 2001, which is an indication of the workload of the people involved in the unit. It is true that we have a staffing problem in this excellent unit and that we require additional staff. I have consulted the Government about this matter and we are in discussions with the unions. There was a meeting this morning about the matter. I hope we will be able to resolve this in the near future and that we will be in a position to give the laboratory the resources it requires.</P>

Why has he ignored for 12 months recommendations that additional resources be provided for the laboratory and that it be restructured in the manner sought by the staff since 1999? Will the Minister acknowledge that the tremendous success of the Garda Síochána and the drugs unit is being completely undermined by his failure to provide the forensic science laboratory with the staff it needs? This was an urgent requirement 12 months ago. Is the Minister telling the House that the Government has made a decision to implement the consultants' report and that the additional 17 staff are being recruited? When can we expect those positions to be advertised?</P>

      <P>Obviously, I am not in a position to go into detail about the discussions which are taking place with the union at present. However, I am doing everything I can to try to resolve this matter, recognising the seriousness of the situation and the need to ensure that the laboratory operates efficiently. The laboratory oper<Col N="443" /> ates on the basis that cases are categorised as A, B or C and urgent cases are dealt with first. I am satisfied that prosecutions in relation to matters being investigated by the laboratory will not be dropped as a result of the present impasse.

      <Quest>if two Algerians were deported from this jurisdiction to Algeria on 9 January 2002 in a private plane accompanied by four members of the Garda Síochána; if so, the cost to the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Two Algerian males were deported to Algeria on Wednesday, 9 January 2002. A private aircraft was chartered to facilitate these deportations. There were five escorting members of the Garda Síochána. It was originally intended that three Algerians would be deported on that day. However, one obtained a temporary court injunction preventing his deportation. The injunction was subsequently lifted by the High Court when there was no challenge to the deportation order and the arrest and detention of the person concerned were found to be lawful. The cost to the State of chartering the aircraft was &euro;23,495 or £18,500. This does not include the cost of Garda overtime or subsistence, although such costs were minimised as the flight departed Dublin Airport at 2 p.m. and returned at 10 p.m. that night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All possibilities of using scheduled flights on commercial airlines were exhausted. Bomb threats were made by one of the deportees on a scheduled flight about to take off. This was a cause of distress to the passengers on board and considerable inconvenience to the airline. The gardaí subsequently attempted to enforce deportation on other flights but all the airlines had become aware of the behaviour of the persons concerned and were unwilling to facilitate the deportation. I received a report from the Garda National Immigration Bureau highlighting the difficulties in enforcing these deportations and <Col N="444" /> the potential consequences of failing to enforce these orders. Two of the three deportees concerned had convictions in the State for a variety of crimes including theft and fraud during the relatively short period they had been in the State.</P>
    <P>If it becomes impossible to enforce deportation orders as a result of disruptive behaviour of deportees, it will send a clear signal that deportation can be avoided by simply being disruptive. Secondly, disruptive behaviour by deportees on scheduled flights will become the norm, leading to concerns for the safety of passengers and staff on aircraft. This will cause further difficulties for the Garda in the already problematic task of enforcing deportation orders. The system of hiring chartered aircraft is used in other European countries returning deported persons in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is well established that an effective deportation process is a necessary element of any immigration system, particularly an effective asylum process. Significant strides have been made with 365 orders enforced in 2001, representing almost a doubling of the figure for the previous year. Approximately 620 persons have been deported since November 1999 with over 560 of the deportations taking place since June 2000. However, there are more than 2,000 persons evading deportation orders at present. The lack of an effective means to deport persons not granted permission to remain in the State calls into question the integrity of the entire immigration system. I am determined that this situation will not arise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>I am aware from discussions with my colleagues at the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council that Ireland's enforcement rate of approximately 19% of orders made is high by international standards and is certainly above the EU average.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>)<b>: </b>The Minister's reply is farcical. Why were these non-nationals granted special treatment? The Minister is, in effect, saying that if one wants to be deported on a private jet, all one must do is get somebody to make a bomb threat. Five gardaí were used to deport two non-nationals. Do gardaí normally accompany people out of the jurisdiction?</P>

      <P>As I said, all possibilities of using scheduled flights on commercial airlines had been exhausted. Bomb threats were made by one of the deportees on a scheduled flight which was about to take off. This was a cause of distress to the passengers on board and considerable inconvenience to the airline. The gardaí sub<Col N="445" /> sequently attempted to enforce deportation on other flights but all airlines had become aware of the behaviour of the persons concerned and were unwilling to facilitate the deportation. If it is not possible to enforce deportation orders as a result of the disruptive behaviour of deportees, the entire process will fall down. It is necessary to ensure that the law of the land is upheld. In that context it was necessary, because no other airline would take them, to hire a private aircraft. I feel that this was perfectly reasonable.</P>
      <P>Gardaí travel with people who are being deported. The deportation rate in Ireland, in comparison to the number of deportation orders made, is in the region of 19% and that is the highest in the EU. However, if passengers on planes are frightened by people making threats about planting bombs and if airlines will not take passengers as a result of those threats, I am left with no option but to try to find an alternative means of ensuring that the law of the land is upheld. I have no regrets or apologies to make about that.</P>

Does he acknowledge, in view of the serious criticisms voiced about these two members of the Garda Síochána by a judge in the High Court, that until the matter is fully investigated it is not in the public interest that either of them should be involved in normal duties? Does he also acknowledge that their being involved in duties of the nature described could undermine the integrity of an investigation? Will he agree that it is desirable that the matter be reconsidered by the Garda Commissioner and that it would be preferable if the matter was investigated by an independent Garda ombudsman with an independent inspectorate rather than it being an internal Garda investigation?

In order to implement this, legislation is necessary and desirable. We need a robust, rigorous, independent mechanism for the investigation of Garda complaints and we are committed to such changes.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The study commissioned by the National Women's Council of Ireland entitled Framing the Future, to which the Deputy refers, was published in November 2001. The brief of the study was to &ldquo;examine the quantity and nature of women's community based and issue-based groups in order to identify a set of integrated strategies and supports for women's empowerment and participation in decision-making, service provision and policy formation at local and regional level&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Its specific objectives were: to audit the nature, activities and aspirations of women's community and issue-based groups throughout the 26 counties; to identify models of good practice developed by women's community and issue-based groups; to identify gaps in supports for the development of the work of women's community and issue-based groups; and to propose a set of integrated strategies and supports for women's empowerment and participation in decision-making, service provision and policy formation at local and regional levels.</P>
      <P>The report notes that the study is not an evaluation of the work of women's organisations but rather an attempt to map the sector and illustrate the contribution of the community and voluntary sector. It notes that in the past decade the Government has set up an increasing number of mechanisms to promote co-operation between the community and voluntary sector and the State and notes the importance of these mechanisms to women's groups.</P>
      <P>Framing the Future shows that the women's community and voluntary sector accounts for over 2,631 groups and organisations, catering for about 75,000 women annually. The number of organisations in the sector has increased significantly in the last ten years, with 43% of organisations established in the last five years and 60% established in the last ten. These groups range from small locally based women's groups to larger service providing organisations, for example women's refuges and rape crisis centres. Funding for such organisations is provided by a range of Government Departments, including the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs, on an issue-driven basis. The health boards are, in particular, an important source of funding for projects combating violence against women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the task force on violence against women was published in 1997 and sets out a strat<Col N="449" /> egy which includes the establishment of a national steering committee and regional committees. Funding is provided, by the Minister for Health and Children via the health boards, to a range of women's organisations for the provision of counselling and support services for women victims of violence. Funding decisions are taken based on the recommendations of regional committees on violence against women which were established in 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>On the issue of funding for women's organisations providing counselling, support and crisis services, the national steering committee has recently commissioned research to examine current and future needs and responses to women who have experienced violence or the threat of violence arising from domestic violence, rape or sexual assault. This study will assist in identifying gaps in service provision and it is expected to be completed in Autumn 2002.</P>
    <P>Since 1997 there has been a significant increase in the amount of funding made available annually to the health boards for women victims of violence, which has resulted in a considerable improvement to these services. In 1997, the sum of £3 million was provided for such services. Funding has increased each year since and in 2002 an additional &euro;0.922 million was made available for services relating to violence against women bringing funding in this area to a total of &euro;11.463 million, or £9.2 million, this year.</P>
    <P>Framing the Future refers to funding and resource issues across the broad range of organisations and groups in the women's sector and makes recommendations pertinent to various Government Departments and agencies and to the National Women's Council of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I note that she was present at the launch of the report. The statistics refer to 2,631 organisations. Does the Minister agree that these organisations are doing excellent work particularly in the area of social support? If we did not have these voluntary organisations we would have even more social problems. These organisations perform an important function in areas where there is rural isolation, high levels of unemployment and drug problems. The main issue in the report was the difficulty in accessing funding. Part of the problem was that there were a number of different Departments through which funding might be sought. Will the Minister of State accede to the request that a mechanism be found within Government to simplify access to funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that these organisations are doing wonderful work around the country. Some 79% of local groups had an average of 19 members each and were operating on a voluntary basis, some with incomes of approximately £1,000. However, while 79% of the groups <Col N="450" /> are locally based, other groups are included, such as the Rape Crisis Centre and others, that get large amounts of funding because they are providing services.</P>
      <P>My Department is very forthcoming with regard to funding for the National Women's Council. The funding for that umbrella organisation has been trebled in the period of this Government. The National Women's Council sponsored this research and currently has a proposal before the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs with regard to developing the area of working with voluntary and community groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the issues of concern, and one that has been raised here in a more general context, is that of insurance. This affects many of these groups. If a facility is being used there may be a problem with the extra cost of insurance, and that may be a new cost. In addition, there are a large number of new groups as the Minister acknowledged in her reply. There is a case for increased funding across the board because of the number of extra groups, because of the insurance issue and because it is becoming harder to get volunteers for voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>To address this issue, the White Paper on sport and voluntary activity was published last September by the Government. There is a fund of £7 million attached to that. Groups, including the National Women's Council, applied for grants from that money. Some £2 million was set aside for national bodies supporting local groups. That scheme was advertised in October last with a closing date in November. There was a very positive response and we are awaiting the outcome of the allocations. That will be of help to the National Women's Council in supporting groups around the country that provide services and that work with women, especially the smaller of the 2,621 groups and organisations referred to.</P>

      <P>The management of the sentences of the person to whom the Deputy refers was the subject of a report by Mr. John Olden, the retired former runaí at Roinn na Gaeltachta. Mr. Olden's report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 6 July 2001. It set out in great detail the manner in which the offender was considered for release including the process of rehabilitation prior to his reintegration back to society. Mr Olden noted that he received full co-operation with his inquiries.</P>
      <P>This man was sentenced to life imprisonment on 22 February 1982. He was released to reside in the community on temporary release in March 1995 under the supervision of the probation and welfare service. His release followed a recommendation made by the Sentence Review Group in November 1991. The Sentence Review Group had been established in December 1989 to advise the Minister for Justice on the management of the sentences of long-term and life sentenced prisoners. The group met the prisoner and reviewed reports from the various services dealing with him in a therapeutic manner during his sentence. These services included the probation and welfare service, visiting psychiatric services, the prison psychology service, education and training services and prison management. The Garda also provided reports for the group's consideration.</P>
      <P>A gradually progressing programme of releases was put in place for this man during the period between 1991 and 1995. This began with accompanied releases of a few hours duration and progressed through unaccompanied releases in the care of his family, to unaccompanied overnight releases. This programme was managed by officials of the prisons division of the Department, along with the prison management and the probation and welfare service. He was returned to prison in September 1996 having breached conditions of his release. He was again released in April 1997 having undergone further work with the probation and welfare service and having again been granted a progressive programme of temporary releases prior to his full release. He was returned to custody again on 31 July 1998 in view of further charges brought against him which were deemed to have breached his conditions of release. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment for indecent exposure on 7 September 1998. He was not considered for further temporary release until that sentence had been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime he again undertook extensive work with the probation and welfare service in prison. He was granted accompanied temporary release for humanitarian reasons due to serious <Col N="452" /> illness in his family in late January 1999. A programme of releases was then put in place as part of the process of attempting to reintegrate him back to the community. This programme was monitored, as normal by a review committee made up of prison headquarters officials, prison management and prison therapeutic services. The concerns of the local community were sought through the probation and welfare service and the Garda.</P>
    <P>The offender began a series of unaccompanied temporary releases, one day per week, in the care of his father in October 1999. Mr. Olden noted a discrepancy in the record of what had or had not been decided in relation to the progression of these releases. I instructed the Director General of the Prisons Service to investigate this matter further and he reported that he had not been able to reconcile the accounts of the officials concerned. Both Mr. Olden and the Director General have said that this system failure was disturbing but that they both believe the offender would have been granted such a programme of releases on the basis of the information then available about him even if the proper procedures had been followed.</P>
    <P>The Olden report and the observations of the Director General which accompanied Mr. Olden's report make it clear that at no stage was this case referred to me for decision or information. This was in line with the prevailing practice where an offender had previously been the recipient of the entire range of temporary releases, that is: escorted in handcuffs with a prison officer; accompanied by an officer, unrestrained; accompanied by either a chaplain, probation and welfare officer or approved person; and unaccompanied temporary release. It was also the practice that where a person serving a long-term sentence was returned to prison, due to a breach of conditions or conviction for an offence attracting a short sentence, that the management of his sentence including decisions on temporary release, would be continued by officials of the Prisons Service at headquarters level. This would be done in consultation with local prison management and the prison therapeutic services, without further reference back to the Minister or to the Sentence Review Group. Temporary release would only be granted after an appropriate interval in which the offender had completed the new sentence, if any, and undergone rehabilitative therapeutic work with the appropriate services within the prison.</P>

        <b>: </b>Does the Minister not accept that to describe what happened in this case as a &ldquo;system failure&rdquo; and to be &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo; is a gross understatement? Does the Minister realise that this is a situation where Mrs. Nancy Nolan, an 80 year old retired national teacher, was clubbed to death in her own house by Thomas Murray, a convicted murderer? Was Murray not already serving a life sentence for fatally stabbing an elderly neighbour 21 years previously? Was he <Col N="453" /> not granted temporary early release despite the fact that the Garda recommended that he should not be released, and that any application should be rejected? While on temporary early release, did he not break his midnight curfew? Did he not make lewd suggestions to local girls? Was he not suspected of setting fire to property belonging to a garda? Did gardaí not report that there was constant fear in the local community that Murray would kill again? In July 1998, was he not convicted of indecent exposure in Galway city? Immediately before the murder of Nancy Nolan, was he not granted 19 unaccompanied, unsupervised releases? Why was authorisation given for the release of this man &ndash; a murderer &ndash; in such circumstances?</P>

      <P>I have explained that this is not a matter that would involve the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform after the original decision to grant temporary release had been given by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am not suggesting that, if I had been Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the year concerned, I would have refused the temporary release because it appears to have been the recommendation that was made to the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>This is a tragic case and the family concerned has suffered greatly. My deepest sympathy goes to them once again. However, there are circumstances where people are given release. In the vast majority of cases this seems to work out and people become rehabilitated. There are some instances where that does not occur. These are the exception although I am not for a moment justifying anything in relation to this matter. However, it would not be possible to introduce a regime where no risk at all would be taken &ndash; in other words, a regime under which long-term prisoners, life prisoners would not be released in order to try to see if they could be rehabilitated. It would not be possible to operate like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that following the events of and the conviction of 1998, alarm bells should have gone off indicating that this was not a prisoner who should be granted such release? Will he indicate if anyone takes responsibility for what occurred in this tragic case? Does he regard it as acceptable that in the context of the report and the further investigation he ordered, there are still two contradictory accounts of events that cannot be reconciled? Does he propose to take any steps to deal with that issue?</P>
      <P>What guarantee can the Minister give us that there will not be a repeat of the type of failure within the system which he acknowledges resulted in the tragic death of Nancy Nolan? Is the person concerned currently under investigation in relation to any other alleged murder offences that remain unsolved?</P>

      <P>I understand that it may well now be concluded.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Shatter's question on whether alarm bells should have gone off, I suppose it is easy to be wise in retrospect. There were localised meetings in relation to the individual concerned. It is true incidentally that in nearly all cases, the gardaí caution against releasing individuals. As I have said, one cannot operate a system of release, where one is trying to reintegrate individuals into society, without there being some risk, however small. I asked Mr. Olden to investigate the matter thoroughly and the director general to consider what improvements could be made following receipt of Mr. Olden's report. Five main recommendations were made by Mr. Olden, all of which have been acted upon in one way or another.</P>

        <b>: </b>To say this was a systems failure is a gross understatement. Will the Minister apologise to the Nolan family for the manner in which the State neglected to protect their loved one? Does he accept that the warnings of the Garda Síochána in this case should have been heeded? The individual concerned was a murderer with a series of breaches of the terms of his early release. Will the Minister have the matter investigated again given that the Olden report contains a mass of contradictions in relation to the different versions of events which should be unravelled and resolved? The head of the person responsible for authorising this individual's release should roll.</P>

      <P>I am deeply sorry that this should have occurred and I have extended my sympathy to the family. I am deeply sorry on behalf of the Department, the Prison Service, the then Government and this Government. The situation is, unfortunately, that an offender, for example, who is up for release may have committed even the crime of murder perhaps several years ago when he or she was very young. It does not mean one can then reasonably conclude that for the rest of his or her life that propensity to kill or cause injury would be such that conditional release could never be contemplated. We could not operate a system like that in any kind of humanitarian regime. It is true that looking back on what happened here, it is a grave tragedy that the individual was ever released. Of that there is no doubt. I confess it is not an exact science. Had I been Minister when the original temporary release was granted, I cannot, hand on heart, say that I would have said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 59 and 136 together. I am aware of the need to update the law on criminal insanity and a Bill to amend the law in this area is being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. As announced in the Government's legislative programme on 29 January 2002, it is expected that the Bill will be published this year. I hope the Bill will be published during the life of the present Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a very complex one and will require very detailed consideration during its passage through the Oireachtas. It will contain extensive provisions dealing with fitness to plead at a criminal trial and a definition of criminal insanity and will also provide for a new verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity to replace the present guilty but insane verdict. The Bill will introduce a new plea of guilty but with diminished responsibility in cases of murder. In addition, it will establish a new review body, the function of which will be to review the cases of persons detained after verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity or findings of unfitness to plead.</P>
      <P>Priority attention was given to the Mental Health Bill which has now been enacted. In addition, a very large volume of other priority legislation has had to be processed in my Department and in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, particularly since the terrorist attack on New York last September. I am confident that the Bill will be published within the timeframe I have given.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why in May 1999 he announced that he would introduce legislation to change the law in this area when, almost two years later, no Bill has been published? Will he acknowledge that there is a need to give far greater priority to addressing these issues? Is he embarrassed by the fact that in three different murder trials, criticism has been voiced <Col N="456" /> in regard to the Government's failure to being forward this badly needed legislation? Will the Minister acknowledge that there is growing public disquiet and concern at the fact that verdicts of guilty but insane are being brought in in cases in which a more appropriate verdict would probably be manslaughter as a consequence of diminished responsibility?</P>

      <P>It is true that the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883, is very archaic legislation under which to deal with modern psychiatric conditions. That much goes without saying. It is true that this law needs to be amended and I have promised to do so. One of the difficulties I have had is getting Bills ordered in the House and getting them drafted, given the volume of legislation which has emanated from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As Deputies Shatter and Howlin should well know, 43 Bills from that Department have been passed by this House, some 42 of which are on the Statute Book. In view of competing priorities, it is difficult from time to time to ensure that certain legislation, which demands priority, receives the level of attention it might deserve. In particular, I point to the legislation required after 11 September and, indeed, to other criminal legislation introduced in the House. I hope we can produce and publish this legislation prior to the end of the current Dáil. Either way, I am assured that the legislation, which is virtually complete, will be published this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister now accepts that this is critical and important legislation which he has failed to bring before the House, although he has promised it for years. Does he accept that there is now a loophole in our criminal law that has been identified and criticised by at least two senior High Court judges? Does he accept that the decision at the start of his administration to abolish the separate Department of Equality and Law Reform and merge both Departments with competing demands for legislative time was a disaster for the administration of justice, for which he is responsible, and the advancement of equality and disability issues, for which the Minister of State is responsible?</P>

      <P>I did not accept criticism on the criminal law insanity Bill this afternoon and I will not be criticised about another Bill which has already been enacted. I fully appreciate and accept the courts are critical of the situation and <Col N="457" /> that the law requires reform. We are dealing with an archaic Act. I fully acknowledge that reform is appropriate and that it should have been done before now. I have had great difficulty with the amount of legislation emanating from the Department due to priorities. I am not making excuses, I am merely telling the Deputy the factual position. My heart is in the right place in so far as this legislation is concerned. I would be extremely anxious and even proud to have such legislation put on the Statute Book but it is not likely that will happen in the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm &ndash; this relates to insanity and criminal law, particularly regarding murder and manslaughter offences &ndash; that following an escape which took place two years ago it is clear that should a person found guilty but insane and committed to the Central Mental Hospital be on temporary release or escape from the Central Mental Hospital and leave the jurisdiction, for example, to go to England, there are no arrangements in place to have them returned to this jurisdiction? Will he indicate what discussions, if any, have taken place with the British Government with a view to putting in place arrangements to ensure that should an escape such as previously occurred take place the person will be returned here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the case to which Deputy Shatter refers. His question is specific as opposed to the general question of insanity law to which this question relates. In deference to him, it is true that the Supreme Court has decided that the special verdict of guilty but insane is, in effect, an acquittal and as a result the events as outlined by Deputy Shatter can occur. As the person concerned has not been found guilty of any crime, it is not possible to bring him/her back here. I accept that is a problem. It is one of the reasons a need exists to amend the 1883 Act.</P>
      <P>On the point regarding persons being held in mental institutions at the pleasure of the Government, it is and has been the practice for some years now to constitute a committee in relation to a given person. The committee would normally be comprised of a psychiatrist, a general practitioner and, perhaps, a senior counsel who would make recommendations regarding the individual from time to time. That is, however, an administrative procedure. It is satisfactory in so far as it goes but it is not a statutory procedure and so is unsatisfactory from that perspective. It is as much as can be done. In the final analysis I agree fully with Deputies that this law requires change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise again the question of escalating insurance costs, a matter to which the Labour Party dedicated its Private Members' business only last week.</P>
      <P>I want, specifically, to raise the question of escalating insurance costs for motorists and explicitly for young drivers. I am prompted by a story in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> that it has seen a copy of the long awaited MIAB Report &ndash; a committee established by the Minister in 1998 &ndash; the conclusions of which the Minister says are awaited by him although an interim report was made available to <i>The Irish Times</i> as a result of an application under the Freedom of Information Act more than a year ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the <i>Irish Independent</i> has seen this report, <Col N="459" /> behind which the Minister has sheltered for a long time, how come he has not seen it? This morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> says that report contains a drastic recommendation to the Government to the effect that price controls ought to be imposed on insurance companies' premia. It goes on to say vested interests are driving up the price of insurance and states that it has seen the report and calls for an independent assessment of compensation. It notes that &ldquo;young drivers are being overcharged&rdquo;, and that the exception to this is young male drivers aged 17 years to 19 years on provisional driving licences. It points especially to the fact that the weightings on young female drivers cannot be justified. It further states that since the establishment of the MIAB committee premiums have continued to rise.</P>
    <P>Yesterday morning on the Order of Business, the Taoiseach told the House, &ldquo;The Minister of State is going ahead with his proposals and the legislation will shortly be introduced&rdquo;. Will the Minister tell the House when that legislation will be introduced? Will it be introduced during his term of office? Does he have the MIAB report? If not, how come the <i>Irish Independent</i> has a copy of it? As the Minister responsible for setting up that committee, is he not entitled to receive a copy of the report? Does the Minister accept that tens of thousands of young drivers are awaiting the publication of this report and his actions on it? This situation does not apply to young drivers only; all categories of drivers are being subjected to increases in insurance premia which are out of line with inflation. Young drivers are, as we all know, being punished. If the MIAB Report is as contained in the <i>Irish Independent</i> article then they are acknowledging that the 17 to 19 years old category of young male drivers on provisional licences are, indeed, a loss maker. What about the 20, 21 or 23 year olds who require a motor vehicle to get to work? They are being inordinately punished by increasing insurance premia.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the urgency and importance of this matter. Can he tell the House, based on the article in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> if there is any relief in sight for motorists? Can the Minister establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board without legislation? The House has eight sitting days left. Young drivers are facing a crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board is in the course of finalising its report to me on motor insurance issues generally, and on the relationship between the premiums charged to each category of driver and the claims experience for that category. I expect to receive the report within the next month. When it is presented to me I will consider the board's recommendations and make appropriate proposals to Government. I am aware that there is a high degree of public interest in the report. Therefore, I will publish it <Col N="460" /> as soon as the Government has had an opportunity to review it in detail.</P>
      <P>Deputies should not be misled by reports in today's newspapers purporting to quote from the report. While the report is still being worked on, the final version is not yet ready for presentation to the board members for their approval before it is presented to me.</P>
      <P>It is premature to speculate as to the impact which the report and its recommendations may have on the cost of insurance, especially for young drivers. It will, however, have an impact on the cost and availability of insurance by providing better market information.</P>
      <P>EU law prevents us from intervening in matters of either the pricing or underwriting of insurance. I am confident, however, that the transparency the awaited report will provide about the Irish insurance market, and the relationship between risk and premium charges in Ireland, will be of positive assistance in the future.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise is answering this matter on which I have tried to contact the Department of Education and Science to get the latest information.</P>
      <P>This is not the first occasion on which I have raised the inadequate facilities in Muckross Park School, a girls' school located in the heart of Dublin 4, where the students are from solid, middle class backgrounds. Behind the affluent facade, however, much is wrong. I have received letters from many parents and raised the issue with the Minister. Parents tell me that the school urgently needs to deal with the present substandard and overcrowded conditions. As there is no room for one third of the students in the main building, six classes, totalling 180 girls, are taught in three old prefabs which are more than 25 years old. Features include totally inadequate heating and insulation, leaking roofs, doors and windows, windows that do not shut properly, toilets in only one of the three prefabs, holes in the doors and walls, and condensation and damp throughout.</P>
      <P>This is totally unacceptable, but it reflects the reality of the Celtic tiger. My new constituency colleague, Mr. McDowell of the Progressive Democrats, appeared on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; during the week to tell us what would happen if the Green Party was in government. I made the point that the Green Party is in government in Finland and Germany and there would never be such accommodation in schools in those countries. This is the eighth richest State in the world, but look at our services &ndash; public transport, education and health. They are completely run down. This shows that our priorities are completely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a delay in dealing with the question of tendering for prefabricated classrooms. Tenders were submitted by Muckross Park School in November 2001 to the Department of Education and Science from which there had been no word <Col N="461" /> at the end of January. Sanction may have issued since, but the delay is unacceptable at a time when money is available. Education should be at the top of our priorities.</P>
    <P>If the Government cannot act to assist affluent areas, God help those in the areas of our city where people do not have money. They will be in a dreadful state. I hope when it comes to Muckross Park School these unacceptable delays will not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked me to deal with this matter in his unavoidable absence.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's position on the proposals for construction of prefabricated classrooms at Muckross Park School, Donnybrook, Dublin 4. I would like to provide some background information on the case. In March 2001 the school authority made an application for repairs and replacement of existing prefabs. A letter issued to the school informing it that the Department required a report on the current condition of the existing prefabs.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the requested information, a letter issued to the school authority in June 2001 informing it to request its design team to prepare tender documentation for replacement prefabricated accommodation instead of repairs and upgrading to the existing prefabs. Tender documentation was received in November 2001. The Department's technical staff examined the documentation and requested clarification on the type of prefab to be utilised. Revised documentation was submitted by the school's design team, but, again, the requested information was not submitted. In January 2002 a response was submitted to the Department's building unit and is being examined by the Department's technical staff.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to inform the Deputy that the Department has sanctioned the architectural planning of a new school for Muckross Park School on the existing site to cater for 550 pupils and a total area of 5,490 square metres, the architectural planning of which is at stage three. It should be noted that the key to expediting progress in any building project is the client accepting from the design team it appointed submissions in compliance with the Department's design team procedures. Failure on behalf of the client to monitor its own project and the submission of incorrect or incomplete documentation will result in delays outside the control of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>ADR, the EU agreement of the carriage of dangerous goods by road, is an important instrument for public safety which we take very seriously, as do the Government and the Minister. Public safety is a key issue. Because of the <Col N="462" /> increased volume of such traffic, there has been an increase in the danger to the public. It is important, therefore, that standards are laid down by the European Union. Training in these standards is provided for drivers, with certification and examination. Training is provided by the private sector in close co-operation with the Department. Examination and certification are carried out by the Department in conjunction with the Health and Safety Authority. There should be strict enforcement and heavy sanction for any breach of the regulations because of the nature of the products being transported. Approximately 200 drivers per month go through the training scheme, two thirds of whom are first-time certificate holders. They cannot drive without that certification. The problem to which I refer arises because of a switchover from the Department of Public Enterprise to the Health and Safety Authority of the examination and certification mechanism. I agree that this function rightly should be placed within the ambit of the HSA. I have no difficulty with that, but the problem arises because departmental officials, who are currently handling the examinations, say they will not be in a position to have such examinations during March because they will be putting their records in order to hand over to the HSA. While they will allow renewal testing for people whose certificates expire during that period, none of the new applicants will be tested.</P>
      <P>To make matters worse, the HSA says it will not be able to start the new scheme for a month after it has taken over from the Department. Therefore, there will be a two month period without any examination or certification and about 300 drivers will be affected. Their livelihoods will be affected because without the certification they cannot obtain insurance. From 1 April, they and their employers will be subject to fines of &euro;190.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the Minister should put whatever resources are required into that section to ensure that during the handover period in March and April the examinations can continue. Having considered this matter in some detail, I am convinced the reason the examinations are not going ahead is to suit civil servants while ignoring the needs of the industry they are there to serve. As a practical, pragmatic politician and a good manager of his Department, the Minister should intervene directly and tell the civil servants to keep the examinations in place while they are handing over the records. It should not be difficult to do so. I hope the Minister will not read out a script and that he will respond to my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for raising this important safety issue. My Department will provide examinations during March for drivers who have undertaken a Health and Safety Authority approved refresher training course for the purpose of renewing their driver training certificate qualification to carry dangerous goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A driver of a vehicle carrying dangerous goods <Col N="463" /> is required to carry a driver training certificate. This shows that the driver has followed a HSA approved training course and passed an examination conducted by the HSA. Three training companies, approved by the HSA, provide the courses to drivers, as required.</P>
    <P>My Department currently has responsibility for arranging examinations at venues throughout the country and for the issuing of driver training certificates to drivers who have been successful in these examinations. Under a 2001 commencement order for the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, the arranging of these examinations and the issuing of certificates will become the responsibility of the HSA with effect from 1 April this year.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the HSA, my Department has undertaken to have all driver trainer certificates issued and all data and files updated and ready for an orderly handover to the HSA by the end of March. This is to ensure an orderly transfer of certification services for drivers following the handover of responsibilities. To achieve this orderly transfer, it is necessary to limit the number of examinations in March. However, drivers who have completed refresher courses and have submitted an application form to my Department to sit an examination during that period will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>For drivers seeking certification for the first time, there is no reason that they should not undertake the approved training course in the normal manner in preparation for the full resumption of examinations. My Department is in ongoing discussions with the HSA with a view to devising suitable post handover arrangements that will assist the HSA in resuming examinations as a matter of priority after 1 April.</P>
    <P>Due to the decision to restrict the examinations in March to certification renewals for existing drivers, extra examinations were arranged for February to facilitate demand. I am confident that, with the ongoing co-operation of the HSA, course providers and drivers themselves, the arrangements now being put in place by my Department will ensure continuity of the high level of service for the sector.</P>
    <P>My Department and the HSA are anxious to minimise any dislocation caused by this transfer of responsibilities, which is mandated by an Act of the Oireachtas. We will respond to any reasonable requests in relation to the continuing certification of existing drivers, but we are also anxious to ensure a smooth and orderly transfer of responsibilities, which is in the interests of the dangerous goods transport sector.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue. I also thank the Minister for attending the House to respond to the debate.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need to upgrade the sewerage scheme in Adare, County Limerick. The development of this village and community is severely restricted by the current condition of the sewerage scheme which is totally overloaded. There are great opportunities for residential and tourist development in the village, but these are being frustrated and restricted. Any investors wishing to complete developments have been advised that the sewage disposal system prevents such investment.</P>
      <P>One local developer was endeavouring to construct in excess of 100 private houses while another had plans for a smaller number of houses. The projects were discussed with Limerick County Council but both developers were informed that under no circumstances could the developments be accepted due to sewerage limitations.</P>
      <P>Adare is an extremely attractive village, some would say the most beautiful village in Ireland, but its vibrant tourism industry is being restricted. Any proposals to improve the tourist product of Adare and the opening up of further tourist attractions are being totally discouraged as promoters are advised that planning permission cannot be considered due to the existing sewerage scheme's limitations.</P>
      <P>Proposals to extend a local hotel have been frustrated. The hotel is anxious to increase its capacity in terms of the number of bedrooms, yet this is being discouraged by the planning authority. The hotel also proposed to provide staff accommodation, but this cannot be achieved either so the hotel is being forced to purchase private houses to accommodate its staff. This has the effect of inflating prices and limiting the availability of houses for local people.</P>
      <P>Last April, permission to construct eight luxury houses in the grounds of Adare Manor was only granted on the basis that the hotel's own sewage treatment system would be used until the new village scheme was constructed. There is an enormous opportunity for development in Adare and the county council is currently drawing up a development plan for the village. This plan will be sensitive and will complement the image and atmosphere of the village. If carried out, it will improve the commerce of the town and enhance local service providers. It will be a much better village as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adare is served by a combined sewerage scheme constructed in 1914. The existing sewage treatment works were constructed in 1946 to <Col N="465" /> serve a population of 600 persons. It now serves a population of 1,000, however, and discharges poorly treated sewage into the River Maigue. The sewerage works provide little treatment and they discharge almost raw sewage into the river. The fisheries board is extremely concerned about this and has informed Limerick County Council that it could be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The only saving factor is that in this area, the River Maigue is tidal and quickly removes sewage from the discharge area. It is totally unacceptable that raw sewage should be discharged into the River Maigue. The history of sewerage improvement works goes back over 30 years. In December 1975 the existing system was surveyed and a proposal for adequate sewerage facilities was made. In October 1978 a report was prepared by the council's consulting engineers. Their report was completed in 1979, considered by a meeting of Limerick County Council in that year and subsequently sent to the Department of the Environment for approval in May 1979.</P>
    <P>The council received approval for the preparation of contract documents for the scheme in early December 1981. The tenders for site investigation were submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for approval but such approval was not forthcoming. This preliminary report went out of date with the passage of time and in the meantime in July 1986, land was acquired for sewage treatment works and way leave and rights of way were obtained. In November 1992 contract documents for subsoil investigation were forwarded to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for technical assistance and in February 1993 a certificate of planning was submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The plan was costed in June 1993 at £3.73 million. In 1998, Limerick County Council informed me that it was proposed to engage consultants to revise and update the reports for resubmission to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I was also informed that any of the original route maps of this scheme would be considered out of date. I was informed in November 2000 that the Department of the Environment and Local Government had given approval to progress planning of the scheme and that the council was in the process of appointing consulting engineers to update the 1978 preliminary report of the scheme which was substantially revised in 1985. I was informed that the revised preliminary report should be completed by 2001 and would be submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I now understand that in this month of February 2002, the revised preliminary report is about to be submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. I ask the Minister and the Department to act immediately and progress the development of the scheme as quickly as possible. Adare village deserves no less.</P>
    <P>Adare is a very beautiful and historic village and it is one of the jewels of Irish tourism. For <Col N="466" /> the people who reside there it is their home, their community. It is in the interest of all that tourism is developed, that the children of the community have the opportunity to live in the area and that the community is enhanced by further residential development. This will enable the community to conservatively grow and to maintain the character and atmosphere of the village.</P>
    <P>Adare has many community associations. In 2001, Adare won the Limerick senior hurling championship for the first time ever. I ask the Department to expedite the planning, construction, funding and completion of the scheme. The sewers were laid during a village renewal scheme.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this important issue on behalf of his constituents. The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives has been a major focus of Government spending over the past four and a half years. The unprecedented increase in investment by the Department of the Environment and Local Government during that period on water and sewerage schemes has made a key contribution to the remarkable economic growth that has benefited every part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Total investment in water and sewerage facilities over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will amount to almost &euro;4.4 billion of which more than &euro;3.8 billion is earmarked for major public schemes. This investment is aimed at supporting economic and social development, employment generation and the achievement of high environmental standards.</P>
      <P>The additional water production capacity generated by the resulting expansion of the Department's water services investment programme during the first year of the NDP alone, equated with the average daily requirements of more than 300,000 people. This represented, in just one year, 36% of the corresponding figure for the entire 1994 to 1999 period.</P>
      <P>The increase in waste water treatment capacity in the same year represented the requirements of a population equivalent of 180,000 &ndash; almost half the entire increase between 1994 and 1999. When the figures for 2001 become available shortly, I am confident they will be just as impressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 2000, the first phase of the water services investment programme, covering the years 2000-02, was announced; the beginning of a rolling programme that will continue up to the end of the NDP in 2006. Funding is being provided under this investment programme for new schemes in every single county. The total allocated for Limerick city and county under the first phase of the programme comes to more than &euro;250 million in respect of 14 schemes. This compares to &euro;122 million worth of schemes in the programme inherited in 1997. The schemes approved under the current programme include such major projects as Limerick main drainage, and sewerage schemes in Castleconnell, Croagh, Kilmallock, Patrickswell, and Adare, major water <Col N="467" /> schemes, such as the Limerick trunk mains, Rosbrien to Patrickswell, Limerick environs and Shannon estuary water supply scheme &ndash; phase one, Limerick city southern ring main and Clareville water treatment plant. Foynes water and Clareville/Newcastle rising main are also included. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional serviced residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at different locations around the county.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Adare sewerage scheme, as already indicated, it is included in the current water services investment programme. A preliminary report for the scheme was received from Limerick County Council last August. This report was technically examined in the Department but it was found that some issues needed to be re-addressed. Following discussions between the <Col N="468" /> Department, the local authority and the consultants for the scheme, the authority has requested the consultants to make certain revisions to the preliminary report. The current position, therefore, is that further progress on the scheme depends on the submission by Limerick County Council of the revised preliminary report to the Department. It will be given early consideration when it arrives in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that I received a letter dated 19 January 2001 from the father of the person in question. A reply issued from my Department on 28 February 2001. The letter I received did not specifically refer to an inquiry into the matter but I am aware of requests for an inquiry. My Department's response to the letter in question is in line with the information I have previously given to the House on this matter. For example, my response to Question No. 120 of 3 October 2001.</P>
      <P>My Department's response to that letter referred to the fact that I had made inquiries into the circumstances of the case. It also stated that I had been informed by the Garda authorities that on 26 July 1997 the person in question was arrested and detained at the Bridewell Garda station under the provisions of section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. This arrest and detention related to a double murder at Grangegorman, Dublin 7 on 6-7 March 1997.</P>
      <P>My Department's response also pointed out the following facts of the case, as outlined to me by the Garda. After the person concerned was arrested and detained he made a full admission to investigating officers of his alleged involvement in a double murder. This admission was recorded on audio videotape as provided for under the Provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987.</P>
      <P>Later that day the person made a further detailed admission of his alleged involvement in the murders. This interview was not audio/video recorded at that person's request. His request for the discontinuance of the electronic recording of the interview was also captured on audio video.</P>
      <P>Following consultation between the Garda and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the person was charged with one of the murders at Grangegorman. He appeared before a special sitting of the Dublin District Court and was remanded in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's response also pointed out that I had been informed by the Garda authorities that the manner in which this person was interviewed was in compliance with the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of <Col N="470" /> Interviews) Regulations, 1997, which came into operation on 1 March 1997.</P>
    <P>As a result of matters emanating from another quarter, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to carry out an investigation in order to establish the veracity of the statements of admission. A thorough investigation was carried out and a comprehensive file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The director, having considered the file, directed that criminal proceedings against this person be discontinued. Proceedings were subsequently terminated in the Dublin District Court on 29 April 1998.</P>
    <P>My Department's response of 28 February 2001 also pointed out that I had been informed by the Garda that a file concerning another person mentioned in the letter, received by me from the father of the person in question, was currently with the DPP. It was also pointed out that I have no function in relation to the prosecution of offences and that this function is the responsibility of the DPP. The DPP is independent in the exercise of his functions and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene or comment further on the matter. Subsequently, the DPP decided that no prosecution should take place.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the suggestions made that this case should be referred to a tribunal of inquiry which is proposed in relation to certain matters involving members of the Garda in Donegal. While its terms of reference have not been finalised, I would not be disposed to extending its remit to deal with other cases. I do not believe that I have evidence which would warrant the establishment of a public inquiry in this case.</P>

      <P>Any review of Garda procedures arising from the incident must await the outcome of that investigation. A file will also be prepared for the local coroner to facilitate an inquest into the death. Four persons have been charged. They are currently before the courts in connection with the attempted robbery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission has undertaken a review of the rather complex question of the mental element in murder. As the Deputy is aware, the commission published a consultation paper on this matter in March 2001. Its paper includes consideration of reckless indifference in the context of the <i>mens rea</i> for murder and it puts forward a preliminary view on the matter. The commission made it clear that the recommendations contained in the consultation paper were provisional only and intended to form the basis for discussion. The consultation paper provides interested parties with an opportunity to make submissions on the proposals set out in the paper. The commission will consider these submissions in preparing its final report and recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its introduction to the consultation paper, the commission indicated that it envisaged there would be further papers that would focus on various aspects of the law of homicide. Topics which <Col N="473" /> it is considering for examination in the context of the law on homicide include: provocation, legitimate defence, manslaughter, including corporate manslaughter, causation and proper limits of exculpation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Law Reform Commission is an independent statutory body and that I, as Minister, have no role or function in terms of directing it or setting its timetable or work programmes. It is evident that the commission fulfils a very important function and I value greatly its input into law reform. Its reports have provided the basis for many legislative proposals my predecessors and I have brought before this House.</P>
    <P>It would be premature to take any steps based on a consultation paper, which clearly states that its recommendations are tentative and provisional, before the commission has presented its final report on the issue. Rather than undertaking piecemeal reform it may be prudent to await the review of the entire homicide area before proceeding with any proposals for reform. However, I welcome the commission's examination of these issues. I hope to respond promptly and proactively to its recommendations in this area when they become available.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I will await the commission's report and recommendations before considering what approach should be taken on this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 52, 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>First I will address the issue of the crime statistics for the year 2000. Then I will move on to a consideration of the relevant crime prevention and detection measures currently in place to tackle incidents of assault and other forms of, primarily, street violence.</P>
      <P>The overall picture that emerged from the Garda annual report 2000, as published in January last, is very positive. Although precise comparisons with previous years is made somewhat difficult by the introduction of the new PULSE platform, the 2000 report states that &ldquo;crime categorised as headline crime . . . reflects to a major degree what, in the past, was defined as indictable crime&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this respect 73,276 headline offences were reported or known to the Garda in the year 2000 compared with 81,274 indictable offences in 1999. On this basis serious crime levels fell in 2000 by 9.8% on the previous year and by 27.3% since 1996. However, I am the first to accept that despite this outstanding performance not all individual types of offence display the same positive, downward trend in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>With regard to the category of offence to which the Deputies drew attention, namely assault causing harm, the Garda annual report 2000 states that 1,703 such offences were recorded in that year. This is in comparison to 737 recorded in the previous year. Although the 2000 figure represents a very small proportion of total serious crime &ndash; in fact, only about 2.3% &ndash; this increase is a matter of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relying solely on the headline offence category provides a less than complete picture in relation to the overall incidence of assault. It is important to note that 83% of assaults in the year 2000 are recorded as non-headline offences. In 1999 pro<Col N="475" /> ceedings were taken in 8,664 cases of non-indictable assault, excluding assaults on gardaí on duty. The corresponding figure for 2000 was 8,422 which represents a decline of 2.8%.</P>
    <P>The combined indictable-non-indictable statistics for assault in 1999 was 10,208 and the headline and non-headline offences in 2000 was 10,933, constituting an overall increase of 7% for all assaults. This demonstrates that the percentage of cases in which there is a more serious level of viciousness has gone from about 7% up to 16%.</P>
    <P>This trend towards increased savagery and viciousness &ndash; mostly involving young males &ndash; is clearly a matter that concerns all of us as parents, citizens and public representatives. As a society we need to get a clearer understanding of the causes of the phenomenon which is, incidentally, not just an Irish phenomenon but part of the current international experience. At present the National Crime Council is carrying out some research on public order generally.</P>
    <P>It is not a phenomenon for which factors normally associated with crime levels &ndash; such as deprivation &ndash; offer a satisfactory explanation. Law enforcement has a crucial role to play in dealing with this problem. However, it cannot be said to be an issue which is capable of being addressed by law and order measures alone. The sad reality is that the young people who become involved in this form of anti-social behaviour come from all backgrounds. For many of them it is a case of having too much money and too little sense.</P>
    <P>Within my functional remit I have put in place measures to ameliorate the tendencies of some young people towards violence in public places. A network of 64 Garda youth diversion projects target for their intake young people at risk of or already dabbling in anti-social activities. Moreover, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, and the statutory age card scheme which I introduced seek to reduce the possibility of under age drinking.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Garda youth policy advisory group report are currently under examination by a cross-functional working group, which will draft an implementation plan to be submitted to the Garda Commissioner for approval.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Garda's law enforcement response, a national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, has been in operation since October 2000. The Garda authorities consider Operation Oíche to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and nightclubs.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the increased presence of Garda members on the streets at night to deal with this form of offending has actually resulted in cases being recorded which, heretofore, simply would not have appeared in any statistics. The reason is that the <Col N="476" /> youngsters on both sides of many of these disputes have an equal or almost equal responsibility for what takes place and an equal desire to avoid involving the Garda Síochána. Although I am not claiming that this is a total explanation for the increase in the figures, it is a significant factor.</P>
    <P>A further significant measure against violent street crime is Garda CCTV. To date CCTV systems have been installed in: Dublin North Central, that is O'Connell Street and its surrounding areas; Dublin South Central, that is Grafton Street and its surrounding areas; and Tralee, County Kerry.</P>
    <P>A CCTV system is currently nearing completion in Cork city and most of the cameras in the system are now fully operational.</P>
    <P>In late 2000 I announced that the number of CCTV systems would be further expanded. I have allocated more than &euro;15 million for expenditure in this area for the period 2001 to 2003. Town centre CCTV systems are now planned for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Galway, Limerick, Athlone and Waterford. The installation of systems in at least a further six areas will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it is enough to throw resources at problems like that and then sit on one's hands, hoping for the best. I am convinced that further law enforcement measures are needed. I propose to introduce legislation specifically aimed at tackling the problem of street violence. I have recently sought and received Government approval for the drafting &ndash; on a priority basis &ndash; of a new criminal justice public order enforcement Bill. The purpose of the Bill will be to provide the Garda with additional powers to tackle anti-social behaviour. It will target drunk and unruly elements who congregate late at night outside or in the vicinity of licensed and other premises, such as fast food outlets, and who by their aggressive and intimidating behaviour threaten the peace and well-being of law abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>This behaviour &ndash; and the publicity which tends to surround it &ndash; can and does become a source of abiding fear for some. It can also lead people to curtail their activities and alter their routines, thereby casting a long shadow over their quality of life on a daily basis. As a consequence, when establishing the State's first ever National Crime Council, I made one of its key terms of reference the requirement to address the fear of crime and to raise public awareness of crime and crime issues.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will continue to monitor existing State responses to the reality of assault on our streets. I will not shy away from introducing further measures, as and when necessary, to promote community security.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for responding to issues in relation to domestic violence falls within the remit of a number of Departments. The Department of Health and Children is responsible for the provision of services to victims and for the allocation of funding to non-governmental organisations providing services; the Department of the Environment and Local Government assists in the provision of crisis accommodation; the Department of Education and Science is responsible for educating children in relation to the issue in the schools; and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs funds community development programmes and grant aids local groups dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility in terms of legislative measures in relation to domestic violence issues, the enforcement aspects of such legislation and measures to deal with perpetrators, including the establishment of perpetrator programmes.</P>
      <P>The relevant legislation is the Domestic Violence Act, 1996. This legislation is comprehensive and provides for a situation where safety, protection and barring orders can be applied for and issued by a District Court as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" />Enforcement of this and other legislation in relation to domestic violence is a matter for the Garda which has a written policy on domestic violence intervention. The policy is clear, unambiguous and non gender specific. It dictates that any incidents of domestic violence reported to the Garda must be fully investigated.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in December 1997 the national steering committee on violence against women was established comprising representatives from the statutory, voluntary and community sectors. The committee's remit is to provide a cohesive, multi-agency, and compassionate response to victims. It is chaired by my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Eight regional committees on violence against women were also established to provide a local-regional response to the issue and to work alongside the national steering committee to develop appropriate responses.</P>
    <P>The steering committee has developed awareness campaigns and held and supported a number of conferences in relation to the issue. It has also developed and distributed information leaflets in relation to the services available and produced a national directory of services for women experiencing violence or the threat of violence.</P>
    <P>At present the steering committee is conducting research into the development of an intervention model for victims and perpetrators of violence. The model aims to bring all the relevant services together to respond in an effective and timely manner. This will include the Garda Síochána, the probation and welfare service, public prosecutors, the Judiciary and the services dealing with victims and perpetrators.</P>

      <P>Following publication of the Disability Bill, 2001, last December, discussions with interested parties about the Bill continued apace. Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace met a broad range of groups representing people with disabilities, their families and carers. On 5 February she met the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and on 6 February she met the Forum of People with Disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her meetings with the groups involved a broad and frank discussion about many aspects of the Bill, including assessment of need and related services, individual rights to equal access and treatment and section 47. She asked all of the groups that she met over the past number of weeks to provide her with detailed proposals for amend<Col N="479" /> ments. The majority of the groups were disposed to forwarding suggestions to her.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week the Government agreed to reconsider key areas of concern which have emerged in relation to the Bill since its publication and to engage in further intensive consultations with interested parties. A number of different approaches to these issues have been proposed. The Minister of State will be exploring the exact nature of the new provisions with all concerned. Today she is writing to all of the groups that were consulted during the preparation of the Bill. Meetings are being arranged so that the amendments can be finalised as soon as possible. The National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the Forum of People with Disabilities are among those to whom the invitation to participate in further consultations is being issued.</P>

      <P>The review group on investment based naturalisation was established to review the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act. Its aim was to see how it might facilitate investment and, if in the course of that review, information emerged that would warrant additional legislative measures, such change could be considered. I have stated my position on this matter on a number of occasions. The scheme stands abolished and I have no plans to re-introduce it.</P>
      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, which was enacted on 6 June last, made extensive changes to Irish citizenship law as enunciated in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 1994.

      <P>The Garda organisation has sole responsibility for the compilation of its crime statistics. Neither I nor my Department has any role &ndash; good, bad or indifferent &ndash; in the process and no such role has ever been sought. Therefore, the end product of the compilation process in the year 2000, namely the Annual Report of An Garda Síochána 2000, is solely a product of internal Garda activity.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, with respect to 2000, the Garda Síochána changed the system of crime presentation as part of the PULSE information technology project. Specifically, the changeover to the PULSE platform allowed the Garda organisation to reorganise its crime classification system. It now more accurately reflects the complex, modern criminal activities reported or known to the Garda.</P>
      <P>For some decades past crime statistics were presented in two main tables titled indictable offences and non-indictable offences. In the year 2000 the Garda revised its presentation. For the first time it used the two main categories of headline offences and non-headline offences.</P>
      <P>It is correct to state that criminal damage offences were previously counted as indictable crime. However, the conclusions which have been drawn about the fact that they are now in the non-headline category are very wide of the mark.</P>
      <P>The advice from the Garda authorities is that before the introduction of the PULSE system a significant percentage of criminal damage offences simply did not feature in the statistics at all. Had they been included they would have been categorised as non-indictable. Therefore, the argument that 10,000 offences, a proportion of which would be criminal damage, have been moved from the headline to the non-headline offence category simply does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Crime counting rules have remained unchanged throughout the process of transition to PULSE. These rules are long established in Ireland and in many European counties. They relate to the manner in which members of the Garda record crimes. So changes in the compilation of crime statistics in the Garda annual report for 2000 primarily refer to the manner of presentation of data and not to willed changes in recording practice. On page 75 of the report reference is made to a number of changes in the manner of presentation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, which prohibits both actions <Col N="482" /> intended to stir up hatred and actions likely to stir up hatred. This review is being carried out in co-operation with the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. Submissions to the Department concerning the current operation of the Act and proposals for amendment of the legislation are being considered as part of the review.</P>
      <P>While progress has been made on the review, two recent developments must be taken into account before the review is concluded. On 28 November 2001 the European Commission presented a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. It is intended that the framework decision will replace an existing Joint Action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia. Negotiations on the framework decision have commenced.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe has also established a new committee on criminalising acts of a racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks. Ireland is participating in this committee which will draw up a draft protocol to the convention on cybercrime on this issue. I consider it appropriate to await the outcome of these negotiations before finalising the review of our existing legislation. This Government has introduced comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation and other measures to combat racism and discrimination.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, contain a broad definition of race that covers race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins. The national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism was established with funding from my Department. Its objective is to develop an integrated approach against racism and promote a more participative and intercultural society. NCCRI, in partnership with a range of non-government organisations, has organised a system of reporting racist incidents. The aim is to provide a profile of the number, type and location of incidents that are occurring and to identify emerging trends.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has been similarly proactive in devising strategies to deal with policing issues in a multicultural society. One of these measures is the establishment of the Garda racial and intercultural office. Its function will be to liaise with racial and ethnic groups and so move diversity issues into the mainstream of contemporary policing practice.</P>
      <P>The national anti-racism awareness programme was launched in October 2001. The programme's framework was drawn up by the NCCRI following a consultation process with key statutory and non-statutory organisations. The aim of the programme is to contribute to creating the environment and the conditions for building an inclusive and intercultural society in Ireland where racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity is valued. A budget of &euro;5.7 million has been allocated to the programme over a three year period.</P>

On 28 March I shall hold a preparatory conference on a national action plan to address racism. This plan will be drawn up in partnership with statutory organisations and civil society over a three month period. It will cover legislative, administrative and other policy initiatives.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputies, in so far as the statistics are available in the format sought, is set out in the following tabular statements. I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that there <Col N="484" /> are some 7,350 asylum applications awaiting final decision in that office. This figure refers to all applications received up to 20 February. Of these nearly 3,050 have been scheduled for interview or have completed the interview process and are awaiting decision. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal has informed me that the estimated number of appeals on hands is 2,444. This figure refers to all appeals received up to 31 January.</P>
    <P>At 31 January only 3,750 applications were on hands for more than six months in the ORAC and in the region of 600 in the RAT with the majority of these being in the final stages of processing. During the period 1994 to 2001, inclusive, approximately 5% of all applicants were granted refugee status at first stage. When the results of appeals lodged during the period are taken into account this figure rises to approximately 8%.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the increase in processing capacity, which has been put in place in both the ORAC and the RAT as part of the Government's asylum strategy, is making a real impact on the backlog of cases. This measure is helping to progressively reduce processing times.</P>
    <P>For example, since July 2001 cases scheduled, processed and completed at first instance have significantly exceeded intake with 8,026 decisions being taken in the past six months of 2001: In July 961 applications were received, 1,473 interviews were scheduled and 1,072 cases processed to completion; in August 983 applications were received, 1,543 interviews were scheduled and 1,407 cases processed to completion; in September 855 applications were received, 1,594 interviews were scheduled and 1,145 cases processed to completion; in October 892 applications were received, 1,213 interviews were scheduled and 1,506 cases processed to completion; in November 904 applications were received, 1,220 interview were scheduled and 1,744 cases processed to completion; in December, 960 applications were received, 645 interviews were scheduled and 1,152 cases processed to completion; in January 2002, 838 applications were received, 1,199 interviews were scheduled and 1,305 cases processed to completion; 1,275 interviews have been scheduled for February 2002.</P>
    <P>In addition the following should be noted: The total number of cases processed by the ORAC in 2001 and 2002, up to 31 January, was 12,142 and 1,305 respectively; the total number of appeals completed by the RAT in 2001 and 2002, up to 31 January, was 3,472 and 567 respectively; interviews are at present being scheduled by the ORAC for applicants who arrived in autumn 2001; over 97% of pre-2001 cases outstanding on or received since 20 November 2000 have now been offered a substantive interview. Thus, from January the ORAC is focusing on applications submitted in 2001. In the ORAC the number of interviews scheduled for 2001 was more than double the figure for 2000. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal scheduled 170% more hearings in 2001 as compared with 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" />I have been informed that the main reasons for asylum applications being withdrawn are parent <Col N="486" /> or sibling of an Irish born child, marriage to EU or Irish national, or voluntary repatriation.</P>

      <P>The legislation which is necessary to provide for the establishment of the inspectorate is currently being prepared. I am anxious that it should be introduced as quickly as possible. In that context, it has been included in the Government's legislative programme.</P>

      <P>The broad thrust of this report is wholly consistent with Government policy and with the strategy statement for the Prison Service published with my approval in October 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22 January the Taoiseach launched the NESF report. In keeping with its mandate regard<Col N="488" /> ing social inclusion and equality, the key focus of the report is on those prisoners who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, are at high risk of marginalisation on release back into mainstream society, are repeat offenders or are at risk of re-offending.</P>
    <P>The report's overall conclusion is that key institutional mechanisms/models to spearhead and ensure effective follow through on its recommendations are urgently required. These include: a Prison Service reintegration group at national level for strategic policy purposes; an interagency group in each prison to develop and implement integrated approaches; and a positive sentence management plan for each prisoner.</P>
    <P>These new structures would be linked up and co-ordinated with one another, with the central focus of all on the re-integration of prisoners. Apart from the input from the various agencies within the remit of my Department, the Deputy will be aware that several other Departments and agencies, as well as voluntary bodies, have key roles in providing services and supports to help prisoners successfully re-integrate back into society.</P>
    <P>Interagency working, the multi-team approach and the elaboration of positive sentence management are each concepts with which my Department, the Prison Service and the probation and welfare service are already familiar. Earlier I referred to the Prison Service's strategy statement 2001 to 2003. This statement sets out, in considerable detail, the strategic work programme on which the service has already embarked to dovetail these integration and rehabilitation concepts into its daily workings and that of each institution.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Development Plan 2000-2006 identifies crime prevention as a social inclusion issue. It details how offenders are generally from disadvantaged groups in society, likely to reoffend and to be further marginalised as a result. It is my Department's overall aim to provide and maintain a secure, efficient, and progressive system of containment and rehabilitation for offenders. The NESF report provides a timely and well <Col N="489" /> researched adjunct to the development of this policy aim.</P>
    <P>The Prison Service reintegration group recommended by the NESF has already been established. It is under the chairmanship of the assistant secretary on the equality side of my Department.</P>

      <P>I accept that I received the Annual Report of An Garda Síochána, 2000 from the Garda authorities at a later point in the yearly cycle than has previously been the case. This delay is solely attributed to the once-off heavy operational workload placed on the Garda organisation arising from the introduction of the Garda PULSE computer system. As the Garda Commissioner explained in his foreword to the Minister in the Annual Report 2000 &ldquo;initially, the operational capabilities of the system were prioritised over the statistical function, hence the delay in issuing this report&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Garda Annual Report 2001, I am informed by the Garda authorities that compilation and validation work on the crime statistics will not be completed for some time. Therefore, it is not possible for me to provide an indicative date for publication at this stage. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the PULSE system will produce timely and accurate statistics in a readily understandable form over time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a number of representations about the Equal Status Act, 2000 as it applied to the licensed trade which raised issues concerning a perceived conflict between the rights of customers under the Equal Status Act and the rights and duties of licensees to manage their premises. In particular, vintners complain that the trend in cases heard to date have been unfavourable to licensees.</P>
      <P>Complaints of discrimination are considered, in the first instance, by the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. The office of the Director of Equality Investigations is an independent statutory office set up under the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the director and her equality officers and equality mediation officers are independent in the performance of their functions. Under section 22 of the Equal Status Act, 2000 the director may dismiss a claim at any stage in the investigation if she is of the opinion that the claim has been made in bad faith or is frivolous or vexatious or relates to a trivial matter.</P>
      <P>Once a case has been determined by the director, the complainant or respondent involved may appeal against the decision to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of licensees retaining control over their premises the position in the current licensing laws is that a licensee may refuse admittance or service to a person or require him or her to leave a licensed premises. For example, it is an offence to permit drunkenness, or any violent or quarrelsome conduct, in a licensed premises or to sell intoxicating liquor to a person who is drunk. Moreover, the renewal of liquor licenses is conditional on the peaceful and orderly manner in which the licensed premises were conducted in the year ending on the expiry of the licence.</P>
      <P>Where licensees are the subject of threats of violence, actual violence and assault or extortion these are all criminal offences and as such should be reported to the Garda Síochána immediately.</P>
      <P>While licensees may be required to refuse admission or service in certain circumstances, this power may not be exercised in an arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory way. Actions by a licensee that are arbitrary or unreasonable may give rise to objections to renewal of the licence. Moreover, discriminatory actions by the licensee that run counter to the provisions of the Equal Status Act, 2000 may be referred to the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 (1) of the Equal Status Act provides that where a service provider has reasonable grounds, other than discriminatory grounds for the belief that provision of the service to the customer in question would produce a substantial risk of criminal or disorderly conduct or behaviour or damage to property, the service provider is not required to serve the customer. Section 15 (2) of that Act further provides that actions taken in good faith by a licensee for the sole purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the <Col N="494" /> Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1999, shall not constitute discrimination.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 15 of the Equal Status Act, 2000, referred to were intended to enable service providers, including licensees to maintain control of their premises without contravening the anti-discrimination law. I would be very concerned if that section was not achieving its aim. Any licensee who is aggrieved with a decision of the equality officer can appeal it to the Circuit Court. The costs associated with defending a claim under the Equal Status Act and of taking an appeal are insurable costs.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the office of the Director of Equality Investigations that of the 46 relevant decisions taken to date only five of those decisions have been appealed to the Circuit Court. No Circuit Court decisions on appeals have yet been made.</P>
    <P>Until such time as I have judgments handed down from the Circuit Court from which weaknesses in the Equal Status Act can be identified, particularly in section 15, I have no clear basis for amending the law.</P>
    <P>In the case of access of children to pubs the legal issues have been clarified to my satisfaction and I intend to seek Government approval as soon as possible for legislative proposals to ensure that a licensee is not obliged to allow children on his or her premises at all times.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the recommendations of the Garda Youth Policy: Advisory Group Report are currently under examination by a cross-functional Garda working group, which will draft an implementation plan to be submitted to the Garda Commissioner for approval.</P>
      <P>The report contains two recommendations relating specifically to matters within my functional remit, namely, the proof of age scheme and the use of mobile CCTV units.</P>
      <P>In the former case, the high level interdepartmental working group established to agree a co-ordinated response to recommendations contained in the interim report on off-licensing concluded that the age card scheme was seen as operating successfully but that efforts to promote awareness and usage of age cards should be intensified. In that context, I established a review group within my Department to examine, in consultation with the Garda authorities, the current age card scheme and to make appropriate recommendations. The review group submitted its report to me in December 2001, and I am currently deliberating on its conclusions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the latter recommendation, I am pleased to report that my Department has approved a request received from the Garda authorities for the purchase of a mobile CCTV unit. I understand, in this regard, that the Garda authorities are currently in the process of making the necessary arrangements to have the mobile unit operational as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The report also recommends the establishment of a regulatory system for fast-food outlets, mainly in relation to opening hours and security standards. This matter is framed in the context of legislation to enable the making of local by-laws and, as such, comes within the area of responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Having stated this I believe more law enforcement measures are needed in this area, and I propose to introduce further legislation aimed at tackling the problem. In this regard, I have recently sought and received Government approval for the drafting &ndash; on a priority basis &ndash; of a new Criminal Justice (Public Order Enforcement) Bill.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to tackle anti-social behaviour. It will target drunk and unruly elements who congregate late at night outside or in the vicinity of licensed and other premises, such as fast food outlets, and who by their aggressive and intimidating behaviour threaten the peace and well-being of decent citizens and are a danger to others and themselves.</P>

      <P>There has been a certain amount of misunderstanding concerning the finding of the equality officer in this case, which has given rise to concern on the part of the licensed trade &ndash; and on the part of parents &ndash; about the licensing, opening and operation of licensed premises.</P>
      <P>For whatever reason, the impression that gained wide currency, was that the equality officer had ruled that children may be present in a licensed premises at any time provided that they are accompanied by a parent or guardian.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What the equality officer found was that having a blanket ban on under 18 year olds being in pubs with their parents is a discriminatory policy against parents of under 18 year olds on the fam<Col N="497" /> ily status ground under the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>However, the equality officer specifically stated that his finding should not be interpreted as meaning that publicans must serve parents when accompanied by their children in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>Instances are cited by the equality officer where a publican could be entitled to refuse service, for example, where a parent was drunk or if a parent or child were disorderly. Moreover contrary to the impression that appears to have been created, the validity of a partial ban, that is, allowing children on the premises before a certain hour, was not considered at all in this case.</P>
    <P>Under current licensing laws, the renewal of liquor licences is conditional on the peaceful and orderly manner in which the licensed premises were conducted in the year ending on the expiry of the licence. In certain circumstances, the licensees may, therefore, be required to refuse admission or service but this power may not be exercised in an arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory way.</P>
    <P>Although the equality officer's ruling was quite significantly qualified in ways that have not been widely understood, I have, in the interests of providing reassurance to parents and others concerned about the ruling asked my Department to examine the ruling and the implications that flow from it. My Department is finalising its examination and I intend to seek Government approval as soon as possible for legislative proposals to ensure that a licensee is not obliged to allow children on his or her licensed premises at all times.</P>

      <P>The issue of absenteeism has been an ongoing concern for the Irish Prisons Service. A number of initiatives have been introduced to address the problem over the years including measures involving an employee assistance programme, medical assistance support, an active health and safety programme and in certain circumstances arrangements to withdraw sick leave with pay facilities or dismissal where persistent excessive absenteeism arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Human Resource Directorate of the Irish Prisons Service has been examining the need for a revised attendance policy to better deal with the issue. Following some research and consultation with prison line management a draft attendance policy has been drawn up. The draft policy has a three-fold purpose, namely, (1) to set out a clear and consistent policy in relation to the management of attendance, (2) to devolve to local prison <Col N="498" /> level the managing of that policy; and (3) to ensure that immediate supervisors have a clear and defined role in relation to the management of staff who report to them.</P>
    <P>This draft attendance policy was outlined to the Prison Officers' Association in December last for their consideration and officials of the human resource directorate will meet the Prison Officers' Association in the coming weeks to progress the matter further.</P>
    <P>In addition, the wider question of attendance requirements including the impact of high levels of overtime are the subject of separate discussions between management and staff in the context of a strategic effectiveness programme. One of the aims of this programme will be to address the current overtime dependence of the service which can have adverse consequences for attendance and absenteeism levels generally.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1244 of 30 January 2002 in which I indicated that a detailed examination of the Rome Statute is currently taking place in my Department in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's office so as to determine the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which will need to be taken so that we can fulfil our obligations under the statute. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Rome Statute was adopted by the UN on 17 July 1998 and signed by Ireland on 7 October 1998, it was not until June 2000 that preparatory measures were agreed to ensure the coming into operation of the court. These measures, which will be adopted by the State parties when the statute comes into force include, <i>inter alia</i>, Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Court and Elements of Crimes to be considered by the court. These proposals will impact on the operation of the Rome Statute and the manner in which implementing legislation might be prepared. Once these measures were agreed and while not prejudicing the outcome of the constitutional referendum on this matter, preparatory work commenced in my Department on implementing legislation in advance of the constitutional referendum. However, progress on this work was considerably affected by the events in <Col N="499" /> the United States on 11 September last and the need to tackle other urgent international legislative initiatives as a result of that atrocity.</P>
    <P>In spite of these other urgent priorities, substantial progress has now been made in preparing what will amount to extensive legislative proposals and I expect to be in position to have these proposals ready for submission to Government relatively soon. Once the legislation is prepared and following enactment, the remaining ratification requirements will be a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and in this regard, I refer the Deputy to that Minister's reply to the House of 7 February 2002, Parliamentary Question No. 45.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that the Bill enacting the constitutional change has yet to be signed by the President as a referendum petition concerning prisoners' voting rights is under appeal to the Supreme Court. I understand the appeal, which was due to be heard last week, will not now be heard until next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of child care service delivery during the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme was established in April 2000 as a seven year programme to increase the number of child care facilities and places in Ireland and to improve the quality of child care services. The total funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during that seven year period of the programme is &euro;437 million, of which &euro;317 million was provided under the national development plan and is co-funded by the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outturn of total expenditure on child care, current and capital, under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme in 2001 was &euro;30.338 million. My Department originally estimated that NDP expenditure on the development of child care services in 2001 would be &euro;56.73 million. It is necessary, for the sake of clarity, to comment on the use of the term &ldquo;underspending&rdquo; in this context. My Department, in accordance with standard practice, estimated the sum of <Col N="501" /> money which, on the basis of various assumptions, it believed would be spent in the year 2001.</P>
    <P>These assumptions involved assessment as to the likely level of demand from the public for child care grants as well as assessments of various other matters that were extremely difficult to judge, such as the speed with which planning permission could be secured by individual applicants, the capacity of the grantees to source contractors and so on. There was no actual experience on which to make assessments in this regard; this was, in fact the first year in which significant demand &ndash; and consequently significant expenditure &ndash; could be expected to arise.</P>
    <P>In the event, the estimated demand and estimated expenditure was well above the actual demand and expenditure experience. However, it would be quite wrong to conclude that this resulted in any loss to potential child care providers or any diminution in my Department's determination to deliver the Government's child care programme fully and effectively.</P>
    <P>As we are dealing with a seven year expenditure programme, what happens is that the money representing the difference between estimated and actual expenditure in 2001 is simply retained for use in subsequent years. The entire funding of &euro;437 million is to be spent over the seven year period and it could equally happen that a start of year estimate could be surpassed during any year depending on planning permission, staff recruitment, etc.</P>
    <P>Given the benefit of last year's very valuable experience in relation to the pattern of actual demand, and in relation to matters such as the speed with which applicants for child care grant aid can get planning permission, can get contractors to start work on projects, etc., we will endeavour to ensure that our estimate for expenditure reflects in as far as possible the true figures that allow for the many variables that impact on it.</P>
    <P>In February of 2001 the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion decided that there should be a consolidation of all funding for child care and as a result of this decision funding from other Departments was transferred to my Department. In addition in October 2000, as a result of negotiations with the social partners the Government decided to increase the overall funding for child care by &euro;50.79 million. As a result of this decision the total allocation for the seven year strategy rose to &euro;437 million and consequently the Estimate for 2001 was revised upwards to &euro;88.521 million. The child care sector was unable to absorb the additional funding in a 12 month time-frame, for the reasons outlined above, and the additional funding will be spent over the life of the seven year strategy. This programme, as I have explained is a demand led scheme, needs led at local level, and is stimulating the development of many new community based and private services.</P>
    <P>At &euro;58.4 million, the estimated expenditure for child care for 2002 is a realistic but conservative figure, based on experience to date of the pro<Col N="502" /> gramme operation for 2000 and 2001 and taking into account contractual commitments and EU rules for co-financed expenditure. Expenditure on child care projects is expected to increase significantly over the remaining years of the seven year strategy as approved projects are completed and existing and future grant applications are approved and brought on stream. The most important issue to note is that &euro;437 million will be spent on child care over the life of the seven year strategy, estimated expenditure not reached in 2001 will be utilised over the period of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>An important development in each county is the establishment of county child care committees. The county child care committees are formulating a child care plan for each county. The county child care committees will provide assistance and advice at local level, this will further stimulate the demand for funding in the areas most in need.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that to address the child care needs of the country it is vital that funding is wisely invested in quality child care services. Any child care service that receives funding under the Department's Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme must be of the highest standard and be a service that will be available and viable into the future. Where community projects are concerned they must serve the needs of the parents and children of the whole community. In many cases it is necessary to provide support to groups to enable them reach a stage where they can formulate a child care plan for their area leading to a quality proposal for funding. This development of the capacity of the sector forms a vital component of the work undertaken by my Department and ADM Limited and will be greatly advanced with the coming into being of the new county child care committees.</P>
    <P>To date, since the introduction of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme in mid-2000, I have approved grants for over 950 projects throughout the country at a cost of some &euro;107 million. These grants are supporting over 28,500 child care places, of which 12,800 will be new child care places.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme comprises a number of different measures designed to stimulate the development of child care services. It includes a number of funding measures such as capital and staffing supports for community based child care projects; capital grants for private child care providers; grants towards child care training projects and quality improvement projects, and the recently announced supports for school age child care services. The programme is wide ranging and has many diverse elements designed to meet the overall objectives as outlined.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that there has not been, nor will there be, any diminution of my commitment and the Government's commitment to expenditure on child care over the remaining years of the programme. The funding allocated <Col N="503" /> towards child care represents the largest amount of funding ever provided for this extremely important sector and it is our intention to ensure that all of this money is spent where it is most needed and where it will provide the greatest benefits to our children and their parents.</P>

      <P>A Garda CCTV system is currently being completed in Cork city and I understand, in this regard, that most of the cameras in the system are now fully operational.</P>
      <P>I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems were to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee &ndash; that was established by the Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications &ndash; relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
      <P>To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the gardaí will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>In June 1999, in response to requests for an enhancement of the clearance system for employment related to children or vulnerable persons, I announced that the Garda Commissioner was undertaking a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements in this area. As a result, it was decided that a central vetting unit should be established within the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The unit was established on 2 January 2002 and is based at the technical bureau, Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park, Dublin 8. The primary role of this unit is to check prospective employees who as part of their duties will have substantial access to children or vulnerable adults. The unit liaises with the various health boards and other agencies throughout the country in carrying out this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Part 4 of the Sex Offenders Act, 2001, obliges convicted sex offenders &ndash; which includes persons convicted abroad as well as in this jurisdiction, and before as well as after the commencement of the Act &ndash; when seeking or accepting employment or a voluntary position involving unsupervised access to children, to inform their prospective employer of the fact of the conviction. Failure to do so is an offence <Col N="505" /> attracting a maximum penalty, when convicted on indictment, of a fine not exceeding &euro;12,697 and-or imprisonment for up to five years. This new offence, which came into operation on 27 September 2001, along with the rest of the Act, is designed to act as a deterrent to unsuitable persons from seeking to gain access to children through the workplace, where relationships based on trust or fear can develop.</P>

That helicopter has now been constructed and fitted out with special police equipment. The acceptance procedures for the EC 135 helicopter have recently been completed. Some additional work is being carried out on the EC 135 and, in the interim, the helicopter is remaining with the contractor in the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>S.I. No. 472 of 2001 sets out the effect on domestic legislation of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1347/00 of 29 May 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses. The statutory instrument also makes the necessary provision for the good administration of the regulation and it is the nature of this administrative provision which is at the heart of the Deputies' questions.</P>
      <P>Regulation 4 of S.I. No. 472 of 2001 provides that applications for the recognition or otherwise of a judgment given in a member state of the European Union and applications for a decision of enforceability of such a judgment shall be made to the Master of the High Court. The statutory instrument further provides that such applications shall be determined by the master by order in accordance with the Brussels II Regulation. This procedure is one which has been followed in respect of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters which has been in force in the State since 1988 and upon which the Brussels II Regulation is largely modelled. My understanding is that the procedure works well in practice and, for that reason, it was considered appropriate that it would be used in respect of the Brussels II Regulation also.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Brussels II Regulation has been in force in Irish law for less than a year, and, in those circumstances, I do not propose at this time to amend the administrative arrangements which have so recently been put in place. While these arrangements are open to review in the future, I am satisfied that, for now, they represent an efficient way of dealing with such applications as may arise under the regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no specific employment rights legislation to protect an employee from dismissal where he or she has less than one year's service with the same employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" />However, where an employee with less than one year's service is dismissed and feels that he or she has been unfairly dismissed, the employee concerned may refer the matter, as a trade dispute, for investigation by a rights commissioner of the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1969 to 1990. A rights commissioner's investigation is, however, voluntary and requires the consent of both parties.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 2001, which are administered by my Department, protect employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs and provide redress for employees who have been found to be unfairly dismissed. This includes situations where conditions of work have proven to be so difficult that an employee is justified in terminating his or her contract of employment. Such a termination must, however, be justified by the employee concerned. This situation is described as constructive dismissal. To qualify under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee must have at least one year's continuous service with the same employer. The requirement of a year's continuous service does not apply to an employee dismissed due to pregnancy or for exercising rights under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, or where the dismissal results from the employee's trade union membership or activities.</P>
    <P>Dismissals associated with health and safety issues would be open to adjudication by the rights commissioner service or the Employment Appeals Tribunal depending on the circumstances of particular cases. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, places a duty on an employee &ldquo;to take reasonable care for his own safety, health and welfare and that of any other person who may be affected by his acts or omissions while at work.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently formally launched the marine tourism sub-measure which will be implemented by my Department as part of the two regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Three aquaculture licences for the bottom culture of mussels in Lough Swilly were granted in November 1999 under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997. The licences were granted following public advertisement of the applications in the <i>Derry People </i>and <i>Donegal News</i> on 31 October 1997 and 25 June 1999. No objections were received in response to the advertisements or from the statutory consultees including the Northern Regional Fisheries Board, which were consulted directly. The decision to license in each case was also publicly advertised in the <i>Derry People</i> and <i>Donegal News</i> on 24 September 1999 and no appeal against that decision was made to the independent statutory Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board established under that Act.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the granting of these licences, the Department became aware that part of the areas licensed might contain wild oysters. In order to establish if such areas existed and to determine whether they represented a commercially viable resource, a comprehensive survey was undertaken by a cross-Border aquaculture team/BIM. The survey revealed that a portion of one licensed area contained wild oysters. This was the first systematic survey of oyster stocks in the lough to be carried out and the results are currently being assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it would be premature at this stage to speculate on what modifications might be made to existing licences, I understand that there have been preliminary discussions between the licence holders and local oyster fishermen in the context <Col N="512" /> of the co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems, CLAMS, process. It is hoped that a local agreement can be reached which will provide the basis for a mutually acceptable resolution of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations working group on contemporary forms of slavery estimates that there are currently 27 million persons living in what it defines as conditions of slavery. Of these, an estimated 20 million are bonded labourers.</P>
      <P>The question of children in slavery and bonded labour is of deep concern to the Government. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights States that: &ldquo;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude: slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.&rdquo; Full adherence to the absolute values enshrined in the declaration is of paramount importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human <Col N="513" /> rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all forms of slavery. Children are among the most vulnerable groups in society and there is a responsibility to protect them from all forms of abuse, including slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as bonded labour, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons.</P>
    <P>Ireland voices its concerns wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and, where the occasion arises, the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland attaches great importance to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which is central to the protection and promotion of children's rights on a global level. Article 32 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child calls on States to:</P>
    <P>. . . recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.</P>
    <P>The convention also calls on states to provide for minimum ages for admission to employment. Ireland urges all States to fulfill their obligations under the convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland has signed the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The optional protocol prohibits the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and provides a non-exhaustive list of acts and activities which shall be criminalised by states parties to fight against these scourges. It further asks for the protection of the rights of child victims and for a close collaboration among states parties to fight against the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.</P>
    <P>Efforts to eliminate contemporary forms of slavery include a wide spectrum of international organisations, NGOs and Governments. Slavery and human rights issues in general are normally considered by the UN bodies which have a specific role and expertise in this area, notably the Commission on Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation, ILO. The working group on contemporary forms of slavery, an inter-sessional working group of the sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights, is the UN body which has responsibility for the study of all aspects of slavery.</P>
    <P>Ireland along with the rest of the EU recognises the importance of abolishing child labour. The EU actively supports the work of the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation and the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, in this <Col N="514" /> area. In 1999 EU members were heavily involved in the successful conclusion and adoption of a new convention aimed at addressing the worst forms of child labour &ndash; the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (182). The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, led the delegation to the 89th International Labour Conference in Geneva in June last year where he raised the issue of bonded labour. In the course of the discussion at the plenary session of the conference he put forward a number of practical measures to address this specific problem.</P>
    <P>The persistence of contemporary forms of slavery, a most fundamental abuse of human rights, presents a challenge to all governments. This Government will continue to highlight and address this issue at every appropriate opportunity.</P>

      <P>The person named participated in the 2000 extensification premium opting for the census system.</P>
      <P>Under this system a herdowner's stocking density was based on the size of the holding, the average livestock unit value of the bovine animals over the age of six months present on the holding plus the livestock unit value of any ewes entered for the ewe premium scheme. Where the stocking density was less than 1.60 livestock units per hectare, the herdowner could qualify for 2000 extensification premium at the higher rate of &euro;66 per eligible animal. Where the stocking density was between 1.60 and 2.0 livestock units per hectare, both figures inclusive, he could qualify for the premium at the lower rate of &euro;33 per eligible animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named under-declared bovine animals at the fifth census date, resulting in an apparent stocking density of 1.581 livestock units per hectare. If the number of bovine animals at <Col N="515" /> the fifth census date had been correctly declared, he would have had a stocking density of 1.652 livestock units per hectare. This stocking density would have entitled him to a much lower extensification premium payment than the 1.581 livestock units per hectare, based on the animals declared.</P>
    <P>Since the under-declaration at the fifth census date was significant &ndash; five animals were declared whereas 12 were found at inspection &ndash;  no extensification premium can be made in this case.</P>

Following an examination of the application it was found that four animals were disposed of inside the six months retention period and were not replaced as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of stamp duty is determined by the Revenue Commissioners in line with stamp duty legislation. Section 30 of the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act, 1999, outlines the legislation in relation to this issue.</P>
      <P>In summary this section imposes a charge to stamp duty on a voluntary disposition in any case where there is no consideration for the property being transferred or where the consideration is less than the market value. In these cases stamp duty is chargeable on the market value of the property transferred and not the lower sale price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that stamp duty is payable at half the specified rate on conveyances of property between certain blood relations. As a <Col N="520" /> result, stamp duty on the transfer of such a house from a parent to his or her son or daughter is payable at half rate. This relief will not apply if a party not satisfying the relationship criteria, for example a spouse or a fiancee, is also a beneficiary from the transfer of the property in question. However the resulting full liability to stamp duty will be avoided if the property transfer takes place in two stages for example father to son and son to wife. This is because no stamp duty is payable on transfer of property between spouses.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that I have made a number of changes in recent years to stamp duty legislation. For example, the first-time buyer of a second hand property pays no stamp duty on a second hand property worth less than &euro;190,500, and any other owner-occupier purchasing a second hand property is exempt from stamp duty on properties valued less than &euro;127,000.</P>
    <P>These changes were in recognition of the increases in house prices in recent years and the knock-on effect this was having on stamp duty payable in respect of ordinary houses. While the rules, rates and thresholds governing stamp duty are reviewed on an ongoing basis, I have no plans to amend them at this time.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that if a house is sold at a reduced rate, the difference between the market value of the property and the consideration paid for the property will be considered as a gift, and as such may be liable for capital acquisitions tax.</P>

      <Quest>the improvements in personal taxation which have occurred in each of the years from 1996 to 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6173/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of personal taxation has been influenced by changes in income tax rates, the standard rate band and tax credits/allowances. A table showing the rates, bands and credits as they were in each year from 1996 to 2002 is attached.</P>
      <P>As a result of changes introduced in the six budgets, the last five of which occurred since this Government came into office, the standard rate of tax has been reduced by seven percentage points from 27% to 20% and the top rate of tax has been reduced by six percentage points from 48% to 42%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard rate band, which affects the point at which a person will begin to pay tax at the higher rate on his or her income, has also been widened considerably since 1996. In 1996, the single person's standard rate band stood at £9,400, &euro;11,936. Having regard to this and to the basic personal allowances as they were then, a single person with an income above &euro;16,316, £12,850, became liable at the top rate of tax. After budget 2002, the band for a single person stands at &euro;28,000 which is higher than the average industrial wage; above this point, the person becomes <Col N="521" /> liable to the top rate of tax. The changes in budget 2002 mean that, as a result of the last five budgets, over 370,000 income earners have been removed from the top rate of tax. There are now 26.7% of income earners paying at the higher rate compared with, for example, over 32% paying at the top rate in 1999-2000.</P>
    <P>The main personal credits, formerly allowances before the move to tax credits, that is, the basic personal credit and the employee, PAYE, credit have also been increased and now stand at &euro;1,520, £1,197, and &euro;660, £520, respectively. The result is that no income tax is paid on income of less than &euro;209, £165, per week &ndash; equivalent to 90% of the current minimum wage of &euro;233, £183, per week. By comparison, in 1996 a single person entered <Col N="522" /> the tax net at just under £75, &euro;95, per week. Over the past five budgets, over 383,000 income earners have been taken out of the tax net, including 71,500 elderly people, bringing the total outside the net to 692,600 &ndash; representing 37% of all income earners. In addition to the above positive changes in personal taxation, there have also been reductions in the burden imposed on individuals by PRSI and levies.</P>
    <P>Overall, the significant reductions in the burden of personal taxation can be gauged from the fact that the average tax rate &ndash; that is income tax, PRSI and levies combined as a percentage of gross income &ndash; faced by a single person on the average industrial wage has fallen from 29.7% in 1996 to 16.8% today.</P>

      <P>The Square Centre in Tallaght was included in the area in Tallaght that was designated for the purposes of the 1986 urban renewal scheme in November 1988 by the Minister for the Environment with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Under the 1986 urban renewal scheme capital allowances of 100% was available in the Tallaght designated area in respect of qualifying construction or refurbishment expenditure incurred on qualifying commercial buildings. In the case of lessors of qualifying commercial buildings the relief could be written off at 50% in year one and the remainder at 4% per annum. Owner occupiers of such buildings qualified for a similar level of relief but could also avail of free depreciation of up to 100% in year one, free depreciation allows the owner to defer writing off the year one allowance if they so wish. The scheme also provided for double rent relief for a ten year period to lessees of qualifying commercial properties. In addition, certain premises could also avail of remission from payment of rates on a straight line basis for a ten year period.</P>
      <P>Relief was also provided for under this scheme in respect of expenditure incurred on the refurbishment, conversion or construction of residential property. In the case of rented residential property, relief was available against all Irish rental income in respect of 100% of qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment, conversion or construction of qualifying property. Owner occupiers qualified for relief of 50% over ten years against all income in respect of qualifying construction and refurbishment expenditure incurred on qualifying residential property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualifying period for the above reliefs in respect of this Tallaght designated area commenced on 9 July 1987 and terminated on 31 July 1994. However provision was made in the 1994 Finance Act whereby expenditure incurred on <Col N="524" /> certain transitional projects up to 31 December 1994 could also qualify for relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Consequently, I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic service and reduce the waiting times for treatment.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North Eastern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cognisant that it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service <Col N="525" /> levels, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional &euro;1.191 million last year for orthodontic services of which &euro;1.032 million was for an orthodontic initiative in the board's area. Under the initiative, the board proposes to recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, develop new orthodontic units in Tralee and the north side of Cork city and commission four additional orthodontic chairs at the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that the Local Appointments Commission has recommended a candidate for one of the two consultant orthodontist positions and the board has offered the post to him. The recruitment process for the second position in the board will shortly re-commence.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were approximately 2,300 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. Nationally the chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the same quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment in the Southern Health Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the waiting list initiative introduced in 1993 dedicated funding is made available to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out additional in-patient waiting list procedures. In <Col N="526" /> order to monitor the performance of health agencies under this initiative, my Department collects and evaluates in-patient waiting list figures on a quarterly basis. My Department does not routinely collect or publish information on out-patient waiting lists. The new health strategy, which I launched recently, will provide a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and improved access for public patients. It outlines measures which are designed to address the issue of efficiency in the delivery of out-patient services. Protocols for investigation and referral to hospital out-patient departments will be developed in conjunction with general practitioners. Nurse-led clinics for selected conditions will be introduced where feasible. I am confident that these measures will result in an improved service for out-patients in public hospitals.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental treatment to eligible persons in County Galway is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board in the first instance. All health boards, including the WHB, have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach; the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow-up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the dental surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular schools. Under the Health Act, 1970 and the Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations 2000, children who have attended national school retain eligibility for dental treatment up to their 16th birthday. Treatment is provided within the resources available to the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the WHB has informed me that the recruitment of a dental surgeon for the Clifden-Carna area is under way. The post was recently advertised and interviews <Col N="527" /> are scheduled to be held in the near future. The chief executive officer is confident that the post will be filled on this occasion and in the meantime, dental care is provided there one day per week. The chief executive officer has also informed me that the provision of full-time dental care to the Mountbellew area was interrupted from September last when the dental surgeon for the area went on a one year career break. The board immediately provided a relief of pain service and a dental surgeon is providing dental care in the Mountbellew clinic one day per week. Furthermore, the dental screening of all sixth class children in the area will be completed before the end of June next and the chief executive officer is confident that full-time dental care will be provided in Mountbellew in the immediate future. Finally, at all times an emergency relief of pain is available for all children in County Galway.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group, 50 to 64 years. To date, over 50,000 women have been called for screening and over 34,000 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of 70%. It is anticipated that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002, as originally intended.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance and best practice and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nationwide. BreastCheck is currently in discussion with health boards concerning expansion of the programme nationwide. My Department will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to nationwide coverage as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>The timetable for the implementation of the European Union Directive on Working Time &ndash; Council Directive 93/104/EC and 2000/34/EC &ndash; in so far as it affects NCHDs, is that in 2004, the average working hours per week will be reduced to 58. By 2007 there will be a further reduction of two hours per week to 56. By 2009 the average hours worked by NCHDs will be reduced to 48. This means that the implementation period will last eight years rather than 12. As part of the process of preparing for the implementation of the EU directive, a major study of non-consultant hospital doctors' working hours was carried out in a representative number of hospitals in association with the Irish Medical Organisation. The study was called The Report of the National Joint Steering Group on the Working Hours of Non Consultant Hospital Doctors, also known as the Hanly report. It shows that junior doctors currently work, on average, 75 hours per week. The Hanly report made a number of recommendations which would change the internal staffing structures and the way in which services are delivered in hospitals. These recommendations include an increase in the number of consultants to create a consultant provided service rather than a substantial increase in the number of NCHD posts. More flexible working arrangements and an extension of shift working where appropriate are also recommended by the Hanly report. Changed work practices are needed to eliminate the 17% of NCHD time which the Hanly report estimated is, on average, allocated to inappropriate work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has approved the establishment of a national task force on medical staffing to prepare and oversee a detailed implementation programme based on the recommendations in the Hanly report and the report of the forum on medical manpower. The first meeting of the task force will take place today, 21 February 2002. The task force will, among other issues, consider the proposed development of a consultant delivered public hospital service and quantify the resource and cost implications involved. The task force will also address the reduction in working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors arising from the EU directive on working time and the medical education and training requirements of our hospital medical workforce. The task force's recommendations will have implications for the <Col N="529" /> number of hospital doctors, both consultants and NCHDs, required in the public hospital service.</P>

The forum is comprised largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. The forum held its first meeting in September 2000. The terms of reference of the forum are to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies and the programme of research being undertaken on behalf of health boards in the area and to report to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The forum invited the public to forward their views on the issues under consideration and received in excess of 1,000 submissions, each of which has been examined individually. The chairman of the forum has informed me that a paper based on the findings of Mr. Parle was presented to the forum on fluoridation. The study carried out by Mr. Parle is essentially a risk assessment of fluoridation plant performance in the south eastern region with recommendations. I understand that the report of the forum on fluoridation, which is being finalised at present, will take into account Mr. Parle's submission. I also note that on behalf of the health boards, Trinity College Dublin is already conducting an analysis of water fluoride delivery systems nationally and has been asked as part of this research to make recommendations on a quality assurance programme for water fluoridation plants.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993 allow health boards the discretion to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting the requirements of the subvention scheme within the board's revenue allo<Col N="530" /> cation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment)(No. 3) Act, 1996. In 1997 the funding available for the scheme was £27 million, in 2001 the sum was £52 million and in 2002 the funding available is &euro;91.4 million. In recognition of the issues involved, this Department made significant additional resources of over &euro;1.5 million available to the Southern Health Board at the end of 2001. Furthermore, the Southern Health Board received an additional &euro;4.24 million this year including a sum of &euro;2.641 million to respond to extra pressures on the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is the Department's intention to remain in contact with all health boards throughout the year on this and other issues. However, as the responsibility for the provision of health services in the Southern Health Board area rests with the board itself, it is a matter for the board to determine the appropriate action to be taken.</P>

      <P>I presume Deputy Allen is referring to a report produced in January 2002 from the conference on the cardiovascular health strategy &ndash; primary care held by the Irish Heart Foundation on 19 October 2001. The cardiovascular health strategy group, under the chairmanship of Michael Jacob, was established in March 1998 by, my colleague, the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, with the remit to develop a strategic approach to reduce avoidable death and illness caused by cardiovascular disease. The group engaged in a wide-ranging consultation process and made 211 recommendations on the development and implementation of an integrated strategy to improve cardiovascular health. The cardiovascular health strategy group was not charged with prioritising its recommendations.</P>
      <P>However, upon the publication of Building Healthier Hearts, the group's report, in July 1999 by An Taoiseach, a range of implementing structures, including the advisory forum on cardiovascular health were established to oversee the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy. The advisory forum was given responsibility, <i>inter alia,</i> to prioritise the recommendations contained within the strategy. In that regard, in November 2001 the advisory forum published Implementation of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Work Programme 2001-04. This document prioritises and sets out a timeframe for the implementation of recommendations of the strategy on an annual basis under each of the main categories &ndash; health promotion, primary care, pre-hospital care, hospital services and information systems audit and research. Discussions on the implementation of the pilot phase of the programme for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in general practice with all stakeholders are now at an advanced stage. It is hoped that agreement will be reached shortly.</P>

      <P>The Medical Council, which, under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is the independent authority charged with regulation of medical practitioners, is currently examining how competence assurance might be implemented. The council has made significant progress towards the introduction of competency standards for Irish doctors. The council has appointed a director of competence assurance who is working with the Medical Council, the professional training bodies and an external reviewer in drawing up a structure which is scheduled to come into force in the next few years. A structure is needed because it is clearly important that doctors are able to demonstrate that competence is maintained, particularly to the public. I understand that the detail is being developed in close consultation with the key stakeholders, including doctors and their representatives, and they will be engaged in both a formal and informal way in developing the competency assessment structures.

      <P>The chief executive officer of the Dublin dental school and hospital has informed me that last year, the hospital received approximately 49 calls from the accident and emergency departments of general hospitals requiring the dentist providing emergency cover to visit. Consequently, the chief executive officer is satisfied that the emergency cover provided by the dental school and hospital is meeting the current demand for its emergency service. In addition, there is an oral and maxillofacial service available, with consultant cover, at Beaumount Hospital, the Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the drug payment scheme with a threshold of &euro;53.33 which replaced both the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme with effect from 1 July 1999. Since that date a common list of reimbursable items operates for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme. Previously, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme were being reimbursed under the community drugs schemes. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services and the drugs payment scheme in relation to the range of items paid for by the State under both schemes.</P>
      <P>In order for any item of medicine to be included in the common list of items reimbursable under the community drug schemes it must comply with a list of criteria. These range from their authorisation status where appropriate, their price and in certain cases the uses for which the products are intended. In addition, the products should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. The Deputy will be pleased to know that the antihistamine to which he refers is included on the common list when in a solid unit dosage form. With regard to the medical device, while this particular item is not reimbursable, there are alternatives on the list which are suitable for both adults and-or children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The maternity and infant care scheme provides an agreed programme of care, free of charge, to an expectant mother arising out of her pregnancy and to her new born baby for six weeks after birth. All expectant mothers who are ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible to avail of services under the scheme. Women who choose to avail of these services are under the care of both a general practitioner of their choice and a hospital obstetrician. After the birth, usually within 48 hours of discharge from hospital, a public health nurse visits the mother and child at their home. The scheme also provides for two designated post-natal visits to the general practitioner. The purpose of these visits is to conduct developmental checks on the baby and a post-natal examination of the mother. The first visit is within two weeks of the birth and the second is at six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to extend the maternity and <Col N="536" /> infant care scheme to provide four additional free GP visits for infants in the first year of life, to cover general childhood illnesses. Section 66 of the Health Act, 1970 states that health boards have a statutory obligation to make available without charge a health examination and treatment service for children under the age of six years. Children who are referred to specialist outpatient services or for admission to hospital arising from these examinations are also treated free of charge.</P>
    <P>A review of child health services, including those provided under section 66, was carried out by the chief executive officers of the health boards and resulted in the publication in late 1999 of the report, &ldquo;Best Health for Children&rdquo;. This report provides for a new core surveillance programme for children in the under one to 12 age group. In the case of babies, in addition to an examination at birth, the visit by the public health nurse within 48 hours of discharge from hospital and a developmental check up at six weeks, the new core surveillance programme provides for the following, free of charge: a developmental check at three months, conducted by the public health nurse; a developmental check at seven to nine months conducted by a doctor, usually an area medical officer and a public health nurse; and a developmental check at 18-24 months, conducted by the public health nurse.</P>
    <P>With a view to facilitating the health boards in commencing the implementation of the recommendations, including putting in place the new core surveillance programme, my Department allocated &euro;1.015 million in 2001 and a further &euro;1.052 million this year. A national conjoint child health committee, established by the chief executive officers of the health boards, is currently overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the recommendations.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question refers to child care and family support services. Responsibility for the provision of social work services in the Ballymun area rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has therefore asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to investigate the issues raised by the Deputy in relation to Ballymun and to reply to her directly in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the current difficulties in relation to the recruitment and the retention of qualified <Col N="537" /> and experienced social work staff. Developments currently under way both at national level and at individual health board level will, I believe, help to alleviate current staffing pressures. These developments will result in improvements in working conditions for staff. A national social work forum has been established to progress a number of key personnel issues of interest to social workers including those arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the expert group on various health professions. Developments include the creation of a new grade of senior social work practitioner and the upgrading of single handed and certain specialised posts. A national network of practice placement co-ordinators is planned and it is intended to undertake a workload management study in the near future. In addition, approximately 30 additional social work training places have been created since October 2001, and it is planned to increase the number of places by in excess of 85 to be phased in from 2002.</P>
    <P>Particular difficulties arise in the area health boards in the eastern region in filling posts for city centre areas, areas of high deprivation and those areas close to rural health board areas. The availability and cost of accommodation in the eastern region is also a factor. Recruitment campaigns in the eastern region are ongoing. In addition, all health boards in the region have adopted a pro-active approach to deployment of staff by employing access workers to assist with access visits between children and families in order to free up social work time; deploying non-social work posts such as community child care workers, family support workers and administrative support where possible to free up social work time; and establishing a management-staff-union group to look at the role of the social worker with a view to establishing what duties can be performed by other disciplines and how the social worker can be better assisted in delivering services. I will continue to keep arrangements regarding the adequacy of social work services in the child care and family support area under review.</P>

    <P>On 1 November 2001, my Department wrote to all major local authorities emphasising the need to expedite the implementation of programmes and to progress the provision of transient sites as part of this process.

    <P>On 23 November 2001 I met with the chairpersons of the Dublin local authorities, of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow county councils, of the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees, as well as the relevant managers and other senior local authority officials to discuss the issues of illegal encampments and provision of transient sites. It was agreed at this meeting that all seven local authorities would liaise appropriately with a view to progressing the provision of transient sites within a co-ordinated timeframe and approach and that each of the authorities would seek to have identified one such site in their area by the end of January 2002.

      <P>The carer's benefit scheme is intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. The arrangements involve two separate elements. The first is a weekly income support payment which is operated and paid by this Department. This is based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The second is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period, which is a key feature of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for carer's benefit a person must be in full-time employment. This condition is satisfied if the person worked at least 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight in the three months prior to applying for carer's benefit. The 19 hour per week requirement is being reviewed.</P>

      <P>A revision of the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, including those rules relating to persons committed for contempt of court, has been under way in my Department for some time. Proposed new prison rules are currently with the law officers for drafting. The suggestion that persons detained in prison for contempt of court should meet the cost of their imprisonment would be a major change in existing practice which has been in place for decades. Any such change would require very careful consideration and this will be done in the context of finalising the new rules.</P>

      <P>As indicated in response to Question No. 125 of 7 February 2002, the report referred to in the Deputy's question was published in December 2001, following an evaluation by a team from GRECO, which is a committee operating under the auspices of the Council of Europe with a particular focus on corruption. The evaluation report centred on the response of a number of Departments and agencies concerning the prevention and detection of corruption, including my own Department, the Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government, the Garda Síochána, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Officer of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners. As such, it is a wide-ranging report.</P>
      <P>The report is generally favourable to Ireland. It concludes that &ldquo;Ireland appears to belong to the group of those GRECO members that are least affected by corruption.&rdquo; GRECO also welcomed the proposals contained in the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2001 which updates the law on corruption and makes it more responsive to modern conditions. As already mentioned, the report covers the response of a number of Departments and agencies in detecting and preventing corruption and, therefore, the recommendations are not a matter for my Department alone. My Department and the other relevant Departments and agencies will examine the recommendations before deciding on the necessary action to be taken in response.</P>

In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 the family in question were informed on 28 December 2001 that it was proposed to make deportation orders in their case. They were given the alternatives of either making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the orders are made or consenting to the making of deportation orders. Representations were received as to why they should be allowed remain in the State. I expect the case in relation to the persons in question to be submitted to me for decision shortly.</P>

      <P>Under current licensing laws, a licensee may refuse admittance or service to a person or require a person to leave a licensed premises. For example, it is an offence to permit drunkenness or any violent or quarrelsome conduct in a licensed premises or to sell intoxicating liquor to a person who is drunk. Moreover, the renewal of liquor licences is conditional on the peaceful and orderly manner in which the licensed premises were conducted in the year ending on the expiry of the licence. However, while licensees may be required to refuse admission or service in certain circumstances, this power may not be exercised in an arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory way. Actions by a licensee that are arbitrary or unreasonable may give rise to objections to renewal of the licence. Moreover, discriminatory actions by the licensee that run counter to the provisions of the Equal Status Act, 2000 may be referred to the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau was established as a statutory agency in 1996. It is a body with staff drawn from the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The bureau also has the support of technical and administrative personnel and the services of a legal officer.</P>
      <P>The statutory remit of the bureau involves confiscating, freezing or seizing assets which, in the opinion of the courts, derive or are suspected to derive from serious criminal activity. It also involves ensuring that criminal proceeds are subjected to tax and that claims for social welfare benefits and assistance by criminals are subject to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Since its inception, the bureau has had significant successes in meeting its objectives. Freezing orders with a view to seizing criminal assets have been secured with a combined total value in excess of &euro;19 million. Taxes and interest demanded are in excess of &euro;47 million. In addition, social welfare over-payments assessed, and savings projected, are over &euro;2 million.</P>
      <P>The bureau presents annually a report on its activities, the most recent report being in respect of the year 2000. The reports to date, which cover in some detail the activities of the bureau, have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the bureau has fully demonstrated the benefits of a multi-agency approach in identifying the proceeds of serious crime and in taking all the necessary actions to deprive those engaged in criminal activity of the material benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated and which came into effect <Col N="545" /> on 6 July 2000, represents a considerable strengthening of the law in relation to underage drinking. It increased fines for breaches of the law on underage drinking, abolished the defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in any proceedings against the licensee and made provision for a new penalty &ndash; a temporary closure order &ndash; for conviction of the sale of alcohol to underage persons. The temporary closure provision is intended to be a strong deterrent to abuses of the law in this area.</P>
      <P>The removal of the &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; defence requires the licensee to ensure that intoxicating liquor is supplied only to those who are legally entitled to purchase or consume it on licensed premises. This places a much greater onus on the licensee to demand proof of age.</P>
      <P>The national voluntary age card scheme, which I introduced by way of regulations in April 1999, is designed to assist licensees in complying with the law. The scheme is intended for persons who have already attained 18 years of age and who are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises and who wish to do so. Its purpose is to provide evidence of age where a doubt exists. In this way, the scheme can assist both consumers and licensees. In any proceedings against a licensee for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person, it is a defence to prove that an age card was looked for and was produced. Where a conviction for the sale of alcohol to such a person is upheld, a licensed premises will be the subject of a mandatory temporary closure order.</P>
      <P>Age cards are issued by the Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2. The application procedure is relatively straightforward and I am happy to say that, to date, a total of 52,000 applications have been processed &ndash; of which approximately 30,000 were processed last year.</P>
      <P>I officially launched the age card scheme awareness campaign in Dublin Castle on 6 September 2000 in conjunction with the Garda authorities. All relevant bodies in the drinks industry were invited to the launch and attended it. I believe that the launch greatly contributed to public awareness of the scheme and also resulted in a considerable increase in applications. I must also acknowledge the support of the licensed trade in this regard.</P>
      <P>The resultant poster campaign initiated by the Garda Síochána continuously targets vintners, off-licences, night-clubs, youth information centres, youth groups, etc.  In addition, Garda juvenile liaison officers and community gardaí visit post-primary schools, youth clubs and special projects, etc., highlighting the age card scheme. Application forms for age cards are available at a variety of locations in order to ensure ease of access.</P>
      <P>The age card was also advertised in a month-long campaign on supermarket till receipts in all main chain-stores. Representatives of the Garda have also given interviews on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" />The Deputy may also wish to note that I recently obtained a budget of &euro;150,000 for the purpose of a new awareness campaign, the details of which will be announced later. This should assist in building on the existing initiatives.</P>
    <P>However, it must be borne in mind that while legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the voluntary age card scheme, can help to curtail the problem of under-age drinking, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. Dealing with the demand side of the underage drinking problem should not be seen as the province of the State agencies alone &ndash; the drinks industry, the creative media and, in particular, parents must also play their part in helping to address that side of the problem.</P>

      <P>All accommodation providers and companies managing state owned properties are required under contract, generically approved by the Office of the Attorney General, to ensure that all accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and state agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, fire safety and general safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the system of dispersal and direct provision was introduced in April 2000, several comprehensive full day inspections have been carried out by the inspection unit of the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, on each property in operation and unannounced short duration visits are also carried out on an ongoing basis. In addition, the agency operates a programme of clinics in centres whereby asylum seekers can make known issues of concern. In general, the <Col N="547" /> inspections have found that the vast majority of centres are operating to a satisfactory standard.</P>
    <P>Where a diminution in standards comes to light as a result of inspections, these are brought to the immediate attention of the centre manager in question for urgent remedial action. Any diminution in standards is treated very seriously by the RIA and could, in cases where they are not remedied, result in the termination of contracts.</P>
    <P>In recent months the agency has engaged the services of an independent assessor who has carried out inspections on a number of centres on a pilot basis and a further pilot is scheduled to begin shortly. On completion of these pilots, the RIA will consider what further steps are required to enhance its inspection programme.</P>
    <P>The RIA and its predecessor, the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, has played a major role in promoting the integration of asylum seekers. In this regard, the agency facilitated the successful hosting of the Community Games in Mosney over three weekends last year which provided an opportunity for the asylum seeker children resident there to interact with their Irish peers. The 2002 Community Games will also take place at Mosney and the RIA is working in close co-operation with the organisers to ensure their success. In addition, the RIA is working with the organisers of the Special Olympics World Games which are scheduled to place in Ireland in 2003 with a view to identifying ways in which it can support the holding of the games.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years the RIA and its predecessor, the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, has facilitated the development of an extensive network of support groups around the country. These are involved in a range of activities to assist asylum seekers settle into local communities.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that the children of asylum seekers are entitled to access primary and post-primary education on the same basis as Irish children. Education is a hugely important factor in integration and the RIA co-ordinates the placement of asylum seeker children in local schools. Adult asylum seekers have access, free of charge, to English language and literacy classes. These are offered by the vocational education committees under the adult literacy and community education scheme.</P>

      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána in their capacity as immigration officers at ports of entry to the State are required under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, to receive applications for asylum and to permit applicants to remain in the State while their applications are being processed.

      <P>The number of applications received by my Department for permission to remain on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen child during 2001 was 6,570, of which 5,924 were in respect of current or former asylum applicants. Prior to 2001, statistics were only maintained on applications granted, not on applications received. The total number of persons granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of their parentage of an Irish citizen was 1,515 in 2000 and 1,428 in 1999. No applications of this type were granted in 1998 as the basis for granting such permission was under review at that time. Figures are not available for the number of persons granted permission to remain on this basis in 1997 and 1996 other than for current or former asylum seekers. In 1997 and 1996, 107 and 142 current or former asylum applicants were granted permission to remain on the basis of their parentage of an Irish citizen.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000 to 2006, makes grant assistance available under a range of measures to develop child care services throughout Ireland. Funding for the programme comes from both the European Union and the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>On 22 January 2002, a capital grant application, under the programme, was received in my Department from the individual in question. The application was immediately passed to ADM Limited, which administers the programme on my behalf, to carry out a technical appraisal of the project proposal. Following its assessment, ADM Limited will submit its appraisal to the programme appraisal committee before I take a decision on the application. It is not appropriate for me to comment any further on the project proposal at this time.</P>

      <P>Irish immigration arrangements do not provide for the granting of permanent residency in circumstances such as those outlined by the Deputy. It is, however, open to the persons in question to apply to my Department for permission to remain in the State on the basis that they are the parents of an Irish citizen. They should write to the immigration division of my Department and enclose copies of their passports, copies of their Garda certificates of registration, the original long form birth certificate of their Irish citizen child, evidence that both parents are living at the address in question, for example, rent book, utility bills, joint bank account etc., as well as two passport sized photographs of each applicant.</P>
      <P>Applications of this nature are dealt with in chronological order and processing time is currently in the region of four months. Permission to remain is generally granted for a 12 month period initially and may be renewed subsequently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the publication of the report referred to by the Deputy in September 2001, I requested the director general of the Prison Service to enter into dialogue with the various interests involved with a view to ensuring that the range of measures recommended in the report be pursued to ensure that the health of prisoners was safeguarded. In particular, I indicated my support for the recommendation that a multi-disciplinary approach, involving both prison and community agencies, be taken to ensure the delivery of health care to prisoners.</P>
      <P>I understand that the director general decided, following consultation with other agencies involved, that the most practical way to move forward on this would be to establish an implementation group to bring the core recommendations of the report forward on a partnership basis. The process of nominating members of this group, which involved contact with the various health boards where prisons are located, is almost complete and the Prison Service expects the implementation group to begin work very soon.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years developments in the organisation and provision of drug treatment services to prisoners in the Dublin prisons have increasingly been undertaken through a partnership mechanism involving both the Prison Service and statutory and voluntary agencies in the relevant communities. This has led to a significant improvement in both the range of such services available and in the numbers of prisoners benefiting from them. To take one example, methadone maintenance programmes are now extensively provided within the Dublin prisons.</P>
      <P>Progress is also being made in relation to a number of other recommendations in this report. A draft set of health care standards is in the process of being drawn up for consideration by the relevant parties. Steps have been taken to undertake a fundamental review of the current contract for prison doctors through negotiation with the Irish Medical Organisation which represents such doctors. Both sides are agreed that the current common contract requires revision in the light of the review group findings and recommendations. Steps are also being taken to increase the number of nurses working in prisons and, in conjunction with this expansion in prison nursing services, proposals are being formulated to develop a clinical nursing management structure at prison level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I launched this report I indicated that the achievement of the recommendations would require considerable dialogue and negotiation with a variety of agencies. Notwithstanding the various difficulties which have dogged this area over the years and particularly given the prob<Col N="551" /> lems associated with providing health care in a custodial environment, I am satisfied that steady progress is being made towards ensuring that the standard of health care afforded to prisoners will be equivalent to that available to citizens in the general community covered by the GMS schemes.</P>

      <P>The Sex Offenders Act, 2001, which was enacted on 30 June, 2001 contains a comprehensive package of provisions aimed at protecting children and other vulnerable persons against sexual abuse and attack. The Act provides for the establishment of a sex offenders register; a civil sex offender order; information on any conviction for a sex offence to be provided to employers for employment purposes; the post-release supervision of sex offenders; separate legal representation for complainants in serious sexual crimes trials in certain circumstances; and a significant increase in the penalty for sexual assault. I brought the entire Act into operation on 27 September 2001 by way of a commencement order.</P>
      <P>In so far as the sex offenders register is concerned, the Act provides for limited retrospection in that convicted sex offenders still in contact with the criminal justice system at the time the Act came into operation, such as those in prison, are obliged to register their names and addresses with the Garda Síochána in accordance with the requirements of the Act.</P>

    <P>According to the Garda annual report, 2000, page 75, &ldquo;crime categorised as headline crime . . . reflects to a major degree what, in the past, was defined as indictable crime&rdquo;. On the issue of the public perception of crime levels, I am mindful that the fear of crime can lead certain persons to curtail their activities and alter their routines, thereby casting a long shadow over their quality of life on a daily basis. As a consequence, when establishing the State's first-ever National Crime Council, I made one of its key terms of reference the requirement to address the fear of crime and to raise public awareness of crime and crime issues.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>In November 1999, I established the independent Courts Service on a statutory basis under the Courts Service Act, 1998. Under the Act, responsibility for the management of the courts system is now conferred on the Courts Service. Section 5 of the Courts Service Act, 1998, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the functions of the service shall be to provide, manage and maintain court buildings and to provide facilities for court users.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have been able to obtain Government approval for the allocation of significant funds for courthouse upgrading in recent years. During the lifetime of this Government, the financial provision for court buildings has increased from &euro;11.3 million, £8.9 million, in 1997 to &euro;26.9 million, £21.2 million, in 2002, which represents an increase of 138%.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the statutory independence of the Courts Service, the Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the Courts Service to decide how funding provided is specifically allocated in connection with its ongoing replacement and refurbishment programme.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of spaces for young offenders under 16 years of age lies with the Minister for Education and Science. I have statutory responsibility for the provision of accommodation for young offenders aged between 16 and 21 years. St. Patrick's Institution and Shanganagh Castle are specifically designated to cater for this age group and currently have a combined capacity of 299. The majority of prisoners under 18 years of age are detained in these two institutions as well as in Fort Mitchel and Wheatfield Prison. On 29 January, 2002, there were 94 such offenders detained in the various prisons and places of detention under the administration of the Irish Prisons Service.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Children Act, 2001, I am obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 to 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. A 38 bed unit for young males in this age group with full support facilities will be provided on a dedicated site adjacent to Cork Prison. Preliminary site works have commenced and a tender competition is being run for the accommodation and ancillary facilities. I expect building work to commence later this year.</P>
      <P>A facility will also be provided in the Dublin area for 110 offenders aged 16 and 17 years of age &ndash; 90 males and 20 females. My Department is actively examining several sites in the greater Dublin area in this regard.</P>
      <P>The probation and welfare service of my Department also funds 33 community residential places for offenders aged under 18 years. There is also a wide range of non-residential placements and projects available for this age group.</P>

The figure for Ireland at that time was 328 but, given the significant increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána since that date, the figure is now estimated to be 307 people per police officer.</P>

      <P>Last November, I announced that I had approved the holding of a Garda recruitment competition early this year to recruit an additional 300 Garda trainees. The current Garda strength of 11,773 is the highest in the history of the State. The strength of the force was 10,818 on 31 December 1996. Recruitment already under way will bring Garda strength up <Col N="560" /> to a record high of 12,000 by the end of 2002 and the recruitment of these additional 300 Garda trainees will ensure that Garda strength is maintained at that level.</P>
      <P>The commitment of a 12,000 strong force is a key priority for the Government. It is a clear sign that the Government is delivering on its commitments to give the Garda Síochána the necessary resources to enforce the law, clamp down on anti-social behaviour and fight crime.</P>

      <P>The management authorities of the Patrician College, Ballyfin, which is included in the Portlaoise catchment area, indicated to my Department some time ago that they were not in a position to continue to provide post-primary education in Ballyfin. As an alternative, they proposed to participate with County Laois Vocational Education Committee in the management of an amalgamated community college, to be located on a site in Portlaoise owned by the VEC. The proposed amalgamation will guarantee the option of co-education in the area in greatly enhanced facilities.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that, as trustees of the Patrician College, the decision to withdraw from trusteeship and management of the school is a matter for the Patrician Brothers. The issue for me, as Minister for Education and Science, is how post-primary educational provision in the catchment area should be structured to best effect, having regard to the brothers' decision and the major capital funding required by the other post-primary schools in the area. Taking all factors into account, I am of the view that the amalgamation proposed by the Patrician Brothers and the VEC is the appropriate course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" />I met with representatives of the Ballyfin parents' council last December, whose objective is to retain a post-primary school in Ballyfin. More recently, officials of my Department met with representatives of the parents and teachers of the school and listened to their concerns. At that meeting, the representatives were given the opportunity to submit their views regarding the proposed amalgamation. Their submission has been received and is being considered at present in the planning section of my Department.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if an announcement was ever made for a new school without configuration of the catchment area being determined; and the way in which his Department can provide funding for a school when the catchment area is not known.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6124/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): I take it the Deputy is referring specifically to post-primary level, where the concept of a catchment area has particular relevance in the determination of pupil numbers, and school transport arrangements.</P>
    <P>A definitive catchment area is not a prerequisite for the announcement of a new post-primary school and such announcements are generally made in advance of the precise configuration having been determined. Examples of recent announcements in this regard include: Moville, County Donegal &ndash; a new community college announced in January 2000; and Ratoath, County Meath &ndash; a new community college announced in May 2001. The precise configuration of a catchment area is determined following a review of existing provision and consultation with current providers of post-primary education in the area concerned.</P>
    <P>The extent of investment in the permanent accommodation to be provided at any school is directly related to the number of pupils requiring facilities in the long-term. In the case of new post-primary schools, the determination of a precise catchment area is an important factor in determining long-term accommodation requirements.</P>

      <P>Music forms part of the revised primary school curriculum and schools are obliged to provide music instruction for their pupils. Boards of management of primary schools are expected to employ fully qualified teachers, able to teach all aspects of the curriculum including music. As a result there should be no need to employ the services of a music instructor to provide music lessons during school time. Should a music teacher be employed, however, such a teacher should act as assistant to the class teacher. The class teacher should be fully aware of the planned content of lessons and should be present at all times during the lessons so that he-she will be in a position to expand on the content in the absence of the outside teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" />While the board of management may employ the services of a music instructor during school hours and ask the pupil's parents to contribute to the cost of running such classes, it should be noted that all pupils have a right to attend classes held during school time irrespective of whether their parents choose to contribute to the cost. In this regard parents can be requested to contribute to the costs of running such classes, but no undue pressure can be brought to bear in order to make parents contribute. If parents choose, for whatever reason, not to contribute, their child still has a right to attend all classes held within school time. Therefore, in relation to music lessons held during school hours, all pupils in classes at whom these lessons are aimed must be allowed participate, irrespective of whether their parents have contributed to the cost of the lessons. In addition, the class teacher must be present for all such lessons.</P>

      <P>My Department has statutory responsibility for the provision of residential places for children up to the age of 16 years who are referred by the courts. There are five young offender centres under the aegis of my Department currently providing accommodation for up to 162 children.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to children &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; is evidenced by the measures contained in the Children Act, 2001. It proposes a modern statutory framework for the development of the juvenile justice system. In addition to updating the provisions relating to young persons who have been sentenced by the courts, including the obligations of the centres under the aegis of my Department, the legislation will provide for a wide range of early interventions and non-custodial alternatives to cater for children coming into conflict with the law or with serious care needs. It also provides for the establishment of the special residential services board. The special residential services board will work in close co-operation with all relevant bodies, to facilitate and ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom children detention orders or special care orders are made.</P>
      <P>My Department is implementing a major capital development plan in the young offender centres to ensure the centres meet obligations that will arise under the Children Act, 2001, in addition to ensuring that they meet modern child care standards.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department has commissioned an independent review of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this review is to ensure there are sufficient residential places available to meet the needs of the target group in the short, medium and longer term. A consultant has been appointed and it is expected that his report will be available shortly. The outcome of this review will inform future development plans in this area.</P>
