      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of topics under Standing Order 31 dealing with four different issues. I will call Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Hogan and I call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to move the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely the increasing difficulties for consumers of getting insurance cover as exemplified by a decision of a court yesterday which resulted in the refusal of a waste management licence for a company in County Kildare.</P>

      <P>I seek to move the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely the decision of the mental handicap nurses to vote in favour of industrial action which will force people with mental handicaps to return home to be cared for by parents in many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to move the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely the ongoing dispute by farmers against the artificially low prices paid by meat factories, the deafening silence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food who should be actively seeking a resolution to this problem and the total lack of confidence Irish farmers have in the Minister for Agriculture and Food to open the Egyptian market despite the promises made before the general election.</P>

      <P>We are objecting to the proposal on the basis that this is not just a case of statements about a despot in Iraq. Not unlike Deputy Kenny's point, this is about Ireland deciding whether or not to take part in a war and the Dáil needs to vote on the matter.</P>

      <P>Who is taking the statements on Iraq on behalf of the Government? Would it be possible to have the documentation that affects the matter we will be discussing placed in the Library? The full text of Ambassador Ryan's statement to the Security Council has not been made available nor have the draft texts which will be put before the Security Council which would have been invaluable to Members making statements. I find it hard to understand the lack of these basic preparations for a debate on a serious topic. There has been no discussion either as to where these statements will lead. I do not wish to delay matters but I point out that the committee on foreign affairs is not in existence nor are there any other mechanisms to proceed. We will not discuss foreign affairs questions until 6 November and a series of bland statements will not answer any of the questions which will be posed by those who wish to speak on the issue. Who is handling the matter on behalf of the Government? Will questions posed in the statements be answered and will the necessary documentation to which we wish to address questions be made available in the Library?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am sure you will agree that the issues relating to the Lindsay tribunal are absolutely central to the lives and indeed deaths of many people. Your experience and our experience has been that the State failed to protect people in need of medical treatment. This afternoon we will have a debate that will last two and three quarter hours. When the Dáil resumed earlier this month, we spent two days debating another report, that of the Flood tribunal, which was important but did not impact in such a crucial way on the lives of people. Will the Taoiseach consider extending this debate, coming back to it on another date if necessary, so that we can look at the issues that were raised in the tribunal report and which sadly were not dealt with adequately in the report? In other countries people were sent to jail as a result of the blood contamination scandal. We have a tribunal report that is grossly inadequate in meeting the needs of those who have suffered so dreadfully. Will the Taoiseach consider having a follow on to this <Col N="11" />debate at an appropriate time so that we in this House can show we are keeping in mind the people who have suffered and died?</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to clarify again the difference between State law and canon law in the matter of clerical sexual abuse. This morning relevant sections of canon law were quoted in the media to the effect that paedophilia was a disease and, according to canon law, clerics thus afflicted should not be removed from active ministries. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has given some clarification on this matter, which I welcome, but the Taoiseach should clarify that irrespective of who the person is, nobody is above the law of the State when it comes to criminal charges and prosecutions being followed through. This is a matter of grave concern to a great number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that whereas primary culpability for the appalling litany of abuse over decades rests with the Catholic Church, the State carries a heavy responsibility also for facilitating an atmosphere and regime whereby the church was allowed to have inordinate influence on matters of State? The mother and child scheme is one of the most blatant examples. By facilitating and bending the knee on matters, the State and successive Governments, preceding that of this Taoiseach, were culpable in allowing such an atmosphere of secrecy and unparalleled power to develop by which this appalling regime of abuse continued. Will the Taoiseach agree and re-affirm that the Church is indeed a private institution in this State and that as such its rules cannot take precedence over what every other citizen must abide by in terms of laws and of how people should be treated in interpersonal communication in their daily lives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the questions asked by the previous speakers. I raised this matter with the Taoiseach yesterday. I ask if he has reflected on the suggestion I put to him that the report conducted by Mr. George Birmingham, SC, into the Diocese of Ferns, could now be extended by the Government to examine the matter on a nation-wide basis? Mr. Birmingham has dealt with the matter very successfully and those directly affected and others involved in the Diocese of Ferns have expressed their satisfaction. Given the sensitive nature of the matter this may be the best approach in the first instance in order to restore trust between the citizens and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the questions in reverse order. In reply to Deputy Quinn's question, I spoke to the Minister for Health and Children this morning. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Health and Children are having a meeting today with the group representing the victims of child abuse in the Dublin area and with representatives from the Diocese of Ferns. We will await the out<Col N="15" />come of that meeting and further discussions with the Attorney General when he returns later in the week from The Hague.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Higgins, I do not wish to comment on the laws and practices of the past because there is not much I can do about the past, I can only attempt to deal with the present and the future. Much good work was done in the past even though these matters are abhorrent.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it absolutely clear, in answer to Deputy Kenny's question, that the law of the land applies to everybody no matter who or what one is or what a person's status is or what they think it is. The law applies to me, to the Deputy and to everybody. I appeal to anyone with information regarding any of these issues, in particular clerical sexual abuse, to give that information to the Garda and it will be dealt with under the criminal justice system without fear or favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Government of the non-statutory inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse in the Diocese of Ferns. I understand that there is another television programme in the can which relates to sexual abuse in the north-west and that this programme is due to be broadcast soon. In view of the claims in today's newspapers that the Hussey inquiry will be able to name names, has the Government given consideration as to whether they can be linked back to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the event of criminal charges being brought if warranted? Has the Government given any consideration to the possibility that it may be necessary to set up a permanent commission to deal with allegations of sexual abuse as it now appears these allegations may well stray into other sectors of society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much discussion on this issue over a number of years. We have introduced legislation and procedures to deal with it, such as the Children's Act, 1998. In relation to clerical sexual abuse, I replied to Deputy Quinn's question yesterday. We must reflect on that. The system used in the Diocese of Ferns has been useful, helpful and reassuring. The next stage of that work will consist of a panel of three persons chaired by Mr. Justice Frank Murphy, a former Supreme Court judge. The other members of the team will consist of a specialist in the area of child protection and a human resources and management specialist. That inquiry follows from the report prepared by Mr. George Bermingham SC. We will consider his report when it comes to dealing with what happened in Dublin and elsewhere. No decision has yet been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny's second question refers to the broader issue of abuse. That will be examined in relation to other legislation. Current issues and the television programmes and newspaper articles mean we will have to reflect on that. We do not wish to make a hasty decision on this matter. We <Col N="16" />must make a careful analysis and decide what is the best way to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A few years ago baggage handlers employed by Ryanair at Dublin Airport were forced out on strike. So blatant was that company's anti-trade union stance that the Taoiseach in a speech referred to capitalism that was red in tooth and claw. Is the Taoiseach concerned by recent press reports that another group of workers at Dublin Airport who are members of SIPTU, in the employment of CityJet Handling, have been forced out on strike for the past two months; that their employer located in the airport two years ago with the stated and express intention of capturing 30% of the airport's baggage and other handling activities and set about doing so by undercutting existing companies and contracts, by paying an average wage one-third less than other airport employers doing similar business, insisting on draconian working conditions and refusing to negotiate with the trade union? Is the Taoiseach aware that as a result, hundreds of other jobs in similar employments in the airport are now threatened? Will the Taoiseach state that Ireland's premier airport which handles 14 million passengers per year, should not be home to anti-trade union, anti-worker companies and that the Government and the State, as the owner of Aer Rianta which controls the airport, has a responsibility to state very clearly that every employer should respect their employees, pay decent wages and not introduce repressive regimes? Will he call on CityJet to desist immediately from its current course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that question I ask the Taoiseach for clarification on the longer-term view regarding Dublin Airport. If this kind of activity is allowed to fester, will it not lead to a complete privatisation of Dublin Airport or is that the Government's long-term intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Joe Higgins raised a very pertinent question on behalf of the technical group. Does the Taoiseach agree that employers have benefited from successive Governments, including Governments in which I served, from the most benign rate of corporation tax and probably the most pro-business environment in terms of our collective desire to promote employment, which has been remarkably successful? Yet, at the heart of the employers' group there is a Taliban of employers who are denying the right of workers to be represented. There is an ongoing dispute in Spring Valley nursing home in Enniscorthy over the right of workers to be represented by whom they so choose and so participate in social partnership. Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that if he values social partnership, as he frequently says he does, he will confront this Taliban of people who want to enjoy the lowest rate of corporation tax and the most pro-business environment in the European Union which has been constructed on the foundation of social <Col N="17" />partnership? Will the Taoiseach say to them that they cannot pick and choose but they must take the collective? Will he tell them that part of that collective is the right of workers to be organised and recognised as trade unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial relations machinery for all these cases should be pursued and unions and their representatives should be allowed to use it where employers do not allow workers to exercise their rights. Deputy Joe Higgins raised one case but there have been many examples over the years, and not only in recent years. People have the right to organise and to deal with issues. There are mechanisms in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission have spent an endless amount of time dealing with cases. In the case referred to by the Deputy &ndash; the case at Dublin Airport some years ago &ndash; the chairman of the Labour Relations Commission worked extremely hard to bring about a resolution. While it may not have been entirely to the satisfaction of everyone concerned, it was helpful.</P>
      <P>There are also codes in place which should be followed. Employers and trade unions in social partnership, and with the benefits they have been given, have responsibilities which they should assume. I am not up to date on the latest position in the dispute raised by the Deputy &ndash; he should raise it with the relevant Ministers &ndash; but as a general rule, the industrial relations machinery and the industrial relations mechanisms in place, which have worked successfully in many cases, should be used.</P>

      <P>I have not delayed it so far, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Taoiseach agree that when an employer blatantly refuses to use the industrial relations machinery and, in fact, flouts it, it puts workers in an impossible position? Does he agree that airport workers should not be subject to these kinds of predatory employers who come to this State to explicitly capture business by implementing &ldquo;yellow packery&rdquo; at its worst and to capture business by introducing a regime of low pay, anti-trade union practices and repression? Will the Taoiseach make a clear and unambiguous statement to Cityjet to get real with its workers or to get out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial relations mechanisms of the State insist that employers treat their workers fairly. In terms of pay, this is one of the few countries with a minimum rate of pay; we have the highest minimum rate of pay. We <Col N="18" />have clear and explicit regulations about conditions of employment. We have probably introduced more legislation than most countries concerning the rights of workers &ndash; legislative, statutory rights &ndash; and employers should adhere fully to it. Companies which flout it, whether this company or any other, are in breach of statutory regulations. If they are in breach of such regulations, it is a matter for the industrial relations mechanisms of the State to determine that. Workers, even those who are not recognised, may still use the industrial relations machinery of the State, and they should do so. Companies and workers, including organised or unorganised workers and those represented by trade unions or others, should follow that route. </P>

      <P>On numerous occasions &ndash; at least 20 I suspect &ndash; one of which included an attempt to publish a Bill which was denied as it was deemed that it would pose a charge on the taxpayer, although it would have been funded from the social insurance fund, my party, including Deputy Rabbitte and many others, have attempted to raise with the Taoiseach and Tánaiste the issue of amending the redundancy legislation to give effect to what has been the Labour Court recommendation in practice in recent times, either two or three weeks' pay per year worked and the abolition of the age differentiation.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with the Taoiseach last Wednesday and maybe it was his unique way of communicating in parliamentary language or a deliberate attempt to try to suggest progress had been made but he referred to a report of 16 October which was published on Tuesday, 22 October. In the three key areas, those to which I referred &ndash; the amount of money, the age differentiation and so on &ndash; no consensus has been reached between the social partners. The Taoiseach did not seek consensus in relation to tax reductions. </P>

      <P>Arising from Deputy Quinn's question and given the nature of employment these days which can be brought to a sudden end because of economic circumstances outside the control of this country, does the Taoiseach consider that a half week's wages per year worked under the age of 41 and one week's wages per year worked over the age of 41 are appropriate in this day and age?

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware this issue has come to national attention because of the closure of Irish Glass? Does he agree that the State scandalously missed a great opportunity to keep that firm open as a recycling facility with an imaginative approach involving Rehab, for example, the workers and local authorities? Does he agree the priority must be to protect every job in the State because a job lost is a job gone for generations to come? When there is a redundancy, does he agree that a half week's pay per year worked or one week's pay per year worked for older workers is a derisory recompense for workers who have, in many cases, spent decades with the employer? Does he agree it is despicable that certain companies which have fabulously wealthy parent companies from which they are legally separated should plead poverty in trying to get out of paying workers being made redundant a decent recompense?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn has raised this issue on numerous occasions. Yesterday the Tánaiste published the report of the Redundancy Review Group, to which I referred last week. The group reached agreement on the treatment of older workers, insurability requirements, ceiling wages, qualification period, determination of weekly pay, non-reckonable service, employees working abroad, fines, penalties and the link between redundancy and training. Administrative issues were agreed, including the rounding of years of service and many other matters relating to the administration of the system. We all welcome that and the Tánaiste said in her statement that she would now prepare the necessary legislation to give effect to the policy changes. That was one part of the equation. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second issue, as the Tánaiste said yesterday and I said in the House last week, the work of the group has clarified and given the costs involved in increasing the level of statutory redundancy payments. As a result of that, the post-PPF negotiations, which will commence next week, will be to the benefit of informing the costs and looking at this issue. The Tánaiste and I have said on the Order of Business and elsewhere many times that it is an issue on which we are prepared to work but the negotiations must take place to see precisely what improvements we can achieve. On the first issue, we have given a clear commitment, while on the second issue, we have <Col N="20" />given a clear commitment to negotiate it in the round of post-PPF negotiations. </P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the concerns expressed by the outgoing general secretary of SIPTU, John McDonnell, that unless progress is made soon on this matter, prospects for a successful new agreement under social partnership will be greatly diminished, if not entirely undermined? Does he recognise that the areas of the report on which agreement was not reached are the key areas which are causing the dispute? Does he agree the level of redundancy ceiling, the differentiation between those under and over 41 years of age, the multiple of weekly pay, the size of rebate to the employer and the provision of an enhanced statutory amount where employers fail or are unable to make statutory redundancy payments are the core issues in the dispute between employers and workers? Does he agree this is important and will he give an undertaking that the man beside him, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will not raid the social insurance fund in the forthcoming budget? He raided it last year to the tune of &euro;635 million. Could I have it established by the Taoiseach that the reason the Government is not making progress on this issue is not related in any way to the fact that it is holding over so it can raid the social insurance fund in the same grubby way it did last year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The gathering crisis over Iraq has been several years in the making. Its root cause is the aggressiveness of the current regime. This aggressiveness has manifested itself in repression at home and attacks against its neighbours abroad.</P>
      <P>Iraq has fought two major wars against other countries in the region. It invaded Iran in September 1980 and it invaded and occupied Kuwait almost exactly ten years later in August 1990. The number of casualties inflicted in these two wars was enormous, amounting to a million dead and wounded. The Iranians fought Iraq to a stand-still after eight years of heavy fighting, one of the longest and bloodiest wars of the second half of the 20th century. Kuwait was powerless to resist the invaders who were ejected only after the international community put together a massive coalition force which fought a brief but intense war against Iraq.</P>
      <P>Iraqi aggression against its neighbours on both these occasions, as on others, was in complete violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. It was destructive of every effort since the Second World War, and earlier, to build up an agreed code of behaviour among states under international law. Under this code it is forbidden to use force and to seize territory. Furthermore, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is forbidden, as is the massacre of civilians and the abuse of human rights. Iraq has broken virtually every rule of international law and of universally accepted standards of behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the ending of the second Gulf War, Iraq was required by the Security Council of the United Nations to give up its weapons of mass destruction. Those are nuclear weapons, chemical or gas weapons and biological or germ warfare. The Charter of the United Nations confers on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Council is empowered and required to make decisions to safeguard peace and the stability of the international order. All member states of the UN are bound by the Charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council and it is a matter of grave concern when any member fails to do so. Iraq is therefore obliged to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions and must live up fully to the conditions imposed on it by the Council. This means, with specific regard to the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction, that Iraq must agree to the return of arms inspectors in full accordance with the conditions laid down in the <Col N="24" />resolutions and not seek to impose its own conditions.</P>
    <P>There has been a whole series of Security Council decisions relating to Iraq. The first of these was Resolution 660 of August 1990 which condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and demanded withdrawal. When Iraq continued its illegal occupation, Resolution 661 followed a few days later. That resolution imposed mandatory economic sanctions against Iraq. The purpose was to compel Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait without the international community having to resort to the use of force.</P>
    <P>Iraq ignored that resolution also. When it became clear that Iraq had no intention of obeying the Security Council's lawful demand that it leave Kuwait, the Council passed Resolution 678 in November of that year. That resolution authorised member states &ldquo;to use all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660 and all subsequent resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area&rdquo;. In other words, the Security Council authorised the use of force unless Iraq withdrew from Kuwait by 15 January of the following year, 1991. Again, Iraq refused to budge and the result was a major conflict in which Iraq was rapidly defeated by the coalition of forces from UN member states mandated by the Security Council. In the aftermath of that defeat, the Security Council adopted Resolution 687 in April. That resolution detailed measures for a ceasefire, including creation of UNSCOM &ndash; the special commission to oversee Iraqi disarmament &ndash; and ordered the removal or destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles capable of delivering them. The International Atomic Energy Agency &ndash; IAEA &ndash; was mandated to deal with Iraq's nuclear weapons programme, which turned out to be far more advanced than anyone had thought.</P>
    <P>In another resolution passed the same month, the Security Council condemned the Iraqi regime's brutal repression of its civilian population and demanded an end to it. Allied forces set up no-fly zones with the express intention of protecting the Kurds and the marsh Shia Arabs. In 1995 the Security Council established the Oil for Food Programme to spare the Iraqi people the worst effects of the economic sanctions which continued in face of the refusal of the Iraqi Government to co-operate with the arms inspectors. It was not until two years later that the Iraqi Government allowed this humanitarian programme to go into effect and to this day the regime impedes the operation of the programme for the most cynical propaganda reasons. Some Members of the House will recall meeting the head of the Oil for Food Programme in New York, Mr. Benon Sobhan, and his briefing on the extent to which Iraq has disrupted the programme's activities.</P>
    <P>More resolutions followed, trying to get Iraq to co-operate with the arms inspectors. Iraq continued to refuse. In November 1998, Resolution 1205 condemned Iraq's formal decision no longer <Col N="25" />to co-operate with UNSCOM and the IAEA. Operation Desert Fox followed in December with an extensive bombing campaign. One year later, in December 1999, the Council adopted Resolution 1284, a very detailed resolution which replaced UNSCOM with a new disarmament agency known as UNMOVIC, which was also intended to meet some of Iraq's objections and to provide the opportunity for a new start. Very significantly, this resolution also tried to address the humanitarian problem by permitting Iraq to export any quantity of oil and by drawing up lists of humanitarian goods which would be exempted from control by the sanctions committee. The resolution also provided that sanctions would be suspended once the arms inspectors reported that Iraq was co-operating in all respects.</P>
    <P>In May of this year, the very important Resolution 1409 was adopted. This resolution completely changes the basis on which the sanctions are operated so as to target the regime and minimise civilian suffering to the greatest extent possible. Ireland has been particularly concerned about the impact of sanctions on innocent civilians. As a member of the Security Council we have been actively involved in all the efforts so far to refine the system of sanctions so as to take into account the humanitarian dimension. We worked hard to obtain a comprehensive and timely solution which would impact as little as possible on the lives of Iraq's civilian population. We were particularly engaged in developing Resolution 1409. We recognise that, as long as sanctions remain in place, however, there is no alternative to the Oil for Food Programme in providing for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. The Government will continue to strongly support practical measures aimed at ensuring the delivery of assistance to children and other vulnerable sectors of the population in Iraq. First and foremost, Iraq must live up to its responsibilities to fully utilise the funds available and co-operate in ensuring that the necessary assistance reaches those most in need.</P>
    <P>Far from complying with these decisions of the Security Council, Iraq embarked upon a campaign of defiance and deception. Iraq did all it could to conceal its earlier efforts to acquire these arms and proceeded to maintain the nucleus of a weapons of mass destruction capacity. Before the arms inspectors were forced to leave Iraq they discovered a programme of weapons development which far surpassed the worst expectations. They destroyed much of Iraq's capacity, but they were unable to complete their work. When the inspectors came too close to discovering the secrets of the Iraqi regime, they were blocked and thwarted and their mission was made impossible. Four years have passed since the inspectors were compelled to leave Iraq. Sanctions have cut across the regime's efforts to obtain the means of manufacturing these weapons, but we will not know for certain how successful the sanctions have been in disrupting this programme until the arms inspectors return. To this day, there is no <Col N="26" />guarantee that Iraq no longer possesses dreadful and illegal weapons. Instead, there is good reason to suspect that Iraq has continued to pursue this programme.</P>
    <P>This attempted proliferation is an issue that goes far beyond Iraq. These weapons are a major threat to both regional and international security. The very attempt by Iraq to obtain such weapons, in violation of its freely accepted treaty obligations, erodes the international instruments aiming to control the spread of these weapons and ultimately to eliminate them.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that Iraq is willing to use these weapons. Iraq has invested vast sums in the effort to acquire or develop these weapons, weapons which can only be intended for offensive use. It has deployed chemical weapons against both Iran and its own people. The Iraqi Government has subjected its people to 12 years of economic sanctions, with all the human suffering that has caused, without remorse or compunction. This could have been stopped immediately had Baghdad agreed to readmit the arms inspectors and co-operate with them. We have to ask the question: what makes the possession of weapons of mass destruction more important to the Iraqi regime than the welfare, even the lives, of its own citizens? </P>
    <P>As if this was not enough, the Iraqi regime has an appalling record of violating human rights. This is not only terribly wrong in itself, it is a further threat to the international order. Respect for human rights is a core dimension in preventing conflict. It is part of the very foundation on which peace and security are built. One of the major objectives being pursued within the international community is to reinforce respect for human rights as part of the rule of law and as a norm of civilised behaviour. Iraq's record is an affront to conscience.</P>
    <P>How could the international community place any trust in a Government which has caused two major wars, used chemical weapons against both enemy soldiers and its own people, and which employs imprisonment, torture and execution as instruments of government? How can we rest satisfied, knowing that this Government is determined to equip itself with weapons of mass destruction, at any cost, and for purposes which range from internal repression to regional hegemony?</P>
    <P>These are the questions which the Security Council is now facing. The Council must do so with all the clarity and wisdom and sense of responsibility which it can muster. This is what the Security Council was put in place to do. This is why it was entrusted under the Charter with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, was quite unambiguous about what is required when he said: &ldquo;All States have a clear interest, as well as a clear responsibility, to uphold international law and to maintain international order&rdquo;. He called on Iraq &ldquo;to comply with its obligations for <Col N="27" />the sake of its own people and for the sake of world order&rdquo;. He went on to say: &ldquo;If Iraqi defiance continues, the Security Council must face its responsibilities.&rdquo;. We should weigh the Secretary-General's words most carefully.</P>
    <P>The United Nations is facing decisions which will determine its ability to cope with an increasingly fractious world. Challenges are posed which demand a sober, realistic and far-sighted response. Inter-connected and multiplying problems combine to assault the international order as the old certainties of the Cold War period dissolve. The Secretary General has called on the members of the Security Council to assume their responsibilities and to demonstrate the necessary will to impose order on an emerging lawlessness which threatens the stability of the international system. As a member of the Security Council, elected by 130 countries who placed their trust in us, Ireland can do no less. We are acting not just on our own behalf, but on behalf of the entire international community and we have an obligation to make decisions which meet the requirements of the situation.</P>
    <P>Ireland approaches this crisis, as we have many other difficult situations, on the basis of well-known positions of principle which Ireland has constantly followed under successive Governments. Ireland has a very long-standing commitment to international peace, security and stability, through the rule of law, peaceful settlement of disputes and protection of human rights.</P>
    <P>These are not just words&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and this is not a newly-discovered policy to chime with the times. This was already our policy when power blocs confronted each other and the voices of those who insisted on the need for justice and morality in the relations between states were often dismissed. However, let us be honest. This policy also serves our own national self-interest. Small countries need the protection of an international order based on concepts of justice, law and respect for the less powerful.</P>
      <P>The other side of that coin is that we must also stand up for the authority of the Security Council and for compliance with the decisions it takes on behalf of the UN members. This means that we must show readiness to adopt measures to enforce the will of the international community when the situation requires. There are no soft options here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland strongly supports the system of collective international security enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The UN is the centre of this system of collective security. It is the world body invested with unique legitimacy and unique authority. The UN is the central forum for discussion and action on issues of global importance. This is an essential function. It can be realised <Col N="28" />only when the members, and especially those in the Security Council, live up to their responsibilities. Ireland's position at the Security Council is based on these principles. Further, we believe that the authority of the Security Council must be upheld and its procedures under the charter must be respected so as to ensure the integrity of the Council in the exercise of its duty. It is for the Council to determine whether there exists a threat to the peace, and then to decide what is to be done to remove the threat and to resolve the measures to be taken if its decisions are not respected or implemented in full.</P>
    <P>Iraq's refusal over so many years to comply with the decisions of the Council poses a continuing threat to peace and security, undermines the authority of the UN and the rule of law, and weakens confidence that a peaceful international order and effective arms control can be maintained. This carries serious implications for the security of every country, including our own. More immediately, this defiance has had tragic consequences for the Iraqi people themselves and it has borne heavily upon their neighbours. None of this suffering was necessary and the Iraqi Government could have prevented it. Instead, we are now heading into an ever more threatening situation.</P>
    <P>This is most certainly not a time for hasty or ill-considered decisions. Events must not be allowed to escape our direction. We see it as imperative that the Security Council should remain in control of developments. For this reason, we welcomed the fact that President Bush brought the issue to the United Nations and that we are now working within the framework of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>We have also welcomed the efforts of UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to convince Iraq to accept weapons inspections. As the Secretary General told the General Assembly, this would be the indispensable first step towards assuring the world that all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated, and they must be eliminated and seen to be eliminated beyond doubt or question.</P>
    <P>We also welcomed Iraq's agreement to the return of inspectors, without conditions. This is a highly important development, but it has to be put to the test. Unfortunately, past experience with Iraq shows that nothing can be taken for granted. Instead, words must be backed with deeds. The time for Iraq to act is now. It must co-operate fully with the inspectors, end its evasions and allow full, free and unfettered access to all sites, as well as to personnel and documentation. There can be no exception for presidential sites. Nothing less than immediate and complete access can carry the necessary credibility. Nothing less can reverse the present dangerous trend towards an unknown but fearful destination. There can be no excuses and no more prevarication. We are fully confident that the arms inspectors will carry out their tasks with the greatest professionalism <Col N="29" />and complete objectivity and impartiality, in accordance with their mandate.</P>
    <P>Ireland shares in the growing international consensus that the Iraqi regime poses a potential threat to regional security. Iraq has so far consistently failed to meet its obligations under international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that diplomatic means offer the best hope of resolving the crisis. In this respect, we welcome President Bush's assurance on Monday that he is willing to make another effort to find a solution through diplomacy. We will strongly encourage that. In our view, every possible effort should be made to avoid the use of military force. We would be seriously concerned that the use of force could destabilise an already volatile region, particularly in view of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. We consider, therefore, that multilateral co-operation in the application of sanctions remains the best approach in tackling the problem of Iraq.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that a time is approaching when continuing Iraqi defiance, if Baghdad should unwisely persist with its present course, will compel the Security Council to examine all the options available to it. We hope this can be avoided. We call on the Iraqi Government to step up the co-operation with the arms inspectors which it has started to show in recent talks with UNMOVIC and the IAEA. These talks resulted in substantial agreement on practical arrangements for the future work of the inspection teams. Some details remain to be finalised on the modalities of access. In addition, the question of access to presidential sites has yet to be addressed. We look forward to the earliest possible agreement on the return of the inspectors and the speedy commencement of work on the ground.</P>
    <P>The entire question will be placed formally before the Security Council shortly. Discussions are under way among the permanent five members of the Council on the text of a resolution to be considered by the full 15 members of the Council. The arms inspectors already have the necessary mandate under existing Security Council resolutions to go about their work and so, strictly speaking, there is no need for a further resolution. However, we agree that there is a strong political case for reaffirming and strengthening that mandate. We have made our views known to the permanent five in consultations at the Security Council. We are ready to study any proposal which would bring further clarity to the conditions under which the inspectors would operate and would strengthen their ability to carry out their tasks.</P>
    <P>All members of the Security Council are in agreement that the inspectors must return forthwith and that they must complete their task of ensuring that Iraq possesses neither weapons of mass destruction nor the means of developing them. All members agree that the inspectors must have full, free and unfettered access, although there is still not full agreement about some of the <Col N="30" />modalities. Further, all members agree that if Iraq refuses to meet these conditions, the Security Council must assume its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Ireland wants very much to see a peaceful solution to this crisis. We are working together with the other members of the Security Council to accomplish this objective. This goal is the overwhelming wish of the international community. The purpose of the UN resolutions is to bring about disarmament, nothing more. Ireland is working within the framework of these resolutions. We do not see that there is a UN mandate for any further end, such as regime change. We believe that UN action against Iraq should be halted as soon as Iraq comes into compliance with the resolutions of the Security Council and implements the Council's decisions in full.</P>
    <P>This common goal can be achieved. It is well within the ability of the Security Council to devise a resolution which will create the necessary conditions to do so. The Council acts on behalf of the entire UN membership in carrying out its primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security. The Council is therefore entitled to expect the full support of the international community, but it must also ensure that it keeps their support. The members of the United Nations gave the Security Council full authority under the charter to act on their behalf. That authority is necessarily enhanced when the Security Council is seen to be acting in accordance with the wishes of the broader UN membership and with their full support. The strength of resolve felt by the international community is most clearly demonstrated when it acts with unity.</P>
    <P>The kind of resolution we believe is most likely to command the widest possible consensus within the Council and beyond is one which deals with the issues firmly, clearly and fairly. It should set out unequivocally what is required of Iraq, show how the crisis can be resolved and make clear the serious consequences of continued non co-operation. First, the resolution must be firm. It should leave no doubt that Iraq must come into compliance, and without delay or further attempts to avoid the obligations imposed on it by the Security Council. The resolution should also leave no doubt that the Council will take any necessary decision to enforce compliance if Iraq does not co-operate as it is bound to do. Second, the resolution must be clear. Any decision on action must be taken by the Security Council in full accordance with the charter. The primary responsibility to make decisions in accordance with the charter regarding the maintenance of international peace and security belongs to the Council and should remain with the Council. It is for the Council to assess whether Iraq is co-operating and, if not, the further steps that should be taken. Third, the resolution must be fair. The demands it makes of Iraq must be demands which Iraq can fulfil, assuming that it wants to do so. Iraq must know that there is a way out of the crisis. If Iraq acts in good faith and meets its obligations, the Security Council will respond. An effective and thorough <Col N="31" />inspection process, with the full co-operation of the Iraqi authorities, will lead to an early suspension of sanctions, in full accordance with the provisions of Security Council Resolution 1284.</P>
    <P>The Government of Iraq can, if it wishes, eliminate the deepening tensions and put an end to the suffering of its people. All that is required is that it lives up to its commitment and obligation under the charter to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council. Such compliance would avoid any further escalation and restore calm. It would also lead to the suspension and eventual removal of the current economic sanctions and ultimately end the hardship faced by the Iraqi people.</P>
    <P>It may be that Iraq will once again defy the international community and all people and Governments who are committed to peace. Iraq may again take the decision not to meet its obligations under Security Council resolutions. In that unfortunate event, it will be for the Security Council to assume its responsibilities and decide on any further action, including the possible use of force, as provided for under the UN Charter. Our hope must be that the Iraqi Government will act to ensure that the Security Council is never forced to take such a decision.</P>
    <P>It is in the power of the international community, and of Iraq, to bring this crisis to a peaceful end, to the enormous benefit of everyone, in particular the people of the region, and most of all the Iraqi people themselves, who deserve no less of their Government. Ireland will do its utmost to help bring about this peaceful solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a statement on Iraq in the House. This is timely, if not overdue, and I hope the House will have an opportunity to express its full view on any action the Irish Government takes before a decision is made on Ireland's vote at the Security Council. As the Minister said, this gathering crisis has been several years in the making, but a gathering crisis it is, perhaps the greatest since the Cuban crisis. However, this time Ireland has a Security Council role and in the event of threats to Ireland as a result of its role we remain unprotected. That is one of the greatest lapses in responsibility shown by this House since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine if this was taking place in times gone by and Saddam Hussein was gloriously installed in Berlin, some Members of this House would share the view that the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, as it then was, was &ldquo;a faraway country. . . of [which] we know nothing&rdquo;, as Mr. Chamberlain said in the British House of Commons. There are people here who seem prepared to turn a blind eye to the outrageous conduct of Saddam Hussein and his maltreatment of his people over a long period. I am glad the Minister has given consideration to the changes that could be made to ensure the sanctions are operated to target the regime and minimise civilian suffering to the <Col N="32" />greatest possible extent. I am glad to hear that Ireland has been particularly concerned about the impact of sanctions on innocent civilians. Again, we must place responsibility for that where it lies &ndash; there have been, as the Minister said, opportunities for aid to Iraq which the regime did not take up.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his contribution that as a member of the Security Council elected by 130 countries who placed their trust in us, Ireland can do no less than ensure the multilateral system works through the UN. I agree with that, but the Minister should consider the people's real concerns about the democratic deficit expressed after the defeat of the first Nice treaty referendum. He should ensure that this deficit does not continue and that this House is consulted fully, either in the House itself or through the relevant committee, before the Government makes up its mind on the vote to be cast by Ireland at the Security Council. I know, for example, that in the USA intelligence chiefs and others are appearing before committees of Congress and explaining their cases. Nothing less than that should be done here because we do have an important role to play.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the entire question would be shortly formally placed before the Security Council. Will the Minister let us know, if not in response to these statements then perhaps by writing to the spokespersons for the various groups, when that decision will be made? How many would give a sufficient mandate &ndash; eight, or nine, of the 15? What is the Minister's view? Will the Minister put the case to us before the Irish vote is cast? The Minister said that any approach should state unequivocally what is required of Iraq, show how the crisis can be resolved and make clear the serious consequences of non-co-operation. In that regard the Minister did not make clear to the House whether there would be two resolutions or one resolution in two parts. This should be made clear and we should be told the intentions of the Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>The attitude taken by the UN to the Iraqi dictatorship and its activities is one of the most important items on the international security agenda and may well become the most important. Ireland is at present a member of the UN Security Council and we may be faced with difficult and important decisions sooner rather than later. As the attitude of the public in the first Nice treaty referendum has shown, it is no longer acceptable for the Government to make decisions of such vital importance without the authority of the people as expressed in the Oireachtas and specifically in Dáil Éireann, given the role which Bunreacht na hÉireann reserves for the Dáil. As a Member of Dáil Éireann I will listen with care to other contributions made here today.</P>
    <P>There are six key issues which should be of concern to the Dáil. Unilateral action against Iraq by any state is not acceptable. Any action must have multilateral support and be authorised in an <Col N="33" />appropriate way through the UN Security Council. I was alarmed to read recently in a survey that a sizeable proportion of the Irish population is not only against unilateral action but also against multilateral action, even if duly authorised through the UN.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an untenable position for Ireland to hold. What has been proposed by senior American officials for Iraq is regime change. We need to be absolutely sure before we give our support to any such far-reaching undertaking. That is not necessarily the objective of any campaign, nor should it necessarily be. Ireland should support a new UN resolution in relation to weapons inspections in Iraq. If this resolution is not adhered to, Ireland should then participate in the debate on a further resolution setting out the action to be taken by the UN to meet such failure. Such a carefully calibrated approach would give us the time and real information on levels of Iraqi co-operation with inspectors to make final key decisions. We cannot have it both ways. This approach would allow us to explore to the maximum extent possible all other avenues before considering the authorisation of military intervention.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need for independent verification of the situation on the ground in Iraq. I was interested to note the Blair dossier on Iraq presented last month to the British Parliament. That dossier contained some information that already had been in the public domain for some time and made various claims, including that Iraq continues to produce chemical and biological weapons; has military plans for the use of these weapons and has command and control arrangements in place to use them; has tried covertly to acquire technology and materials that could be used in the production of nuclear weapons; has sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa despite having no active civil nuclear power programme that could require it; and has recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme and constructed a new engine test stand for the development of missiles capable of reaching parts of the European Union. These are British claims and must be treated with some caution but if they are correct and can be verified, they are of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concerns being expressed by the US and British governments are grave. To assist the Dáil in any consideration we may make in support of Ireland's stand at the Security Council, the Government should seek to have these claims independently verified and make this verification available to Dáil Éireann. The sources for such independent verification could be (a) the common, foreign and security resources of the European Union, (b) its support structures and information gathering facilities, (c) the United Nations itself where our representatives have access to representatives of all countries, large and small, <Col N="34" />(d) our resident embassies abroad or (e) the International Institute for Strategic Studies or similar bodies. The key question for Europe now is whether it decides its response on the basis of co-operation or otherwise with US unilateral action or whether it is prepared to take a role as a regional organisation in contributing to world security under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I have obtained a copy of the IISS report, which makes for very worrying reading. It states in its introduction that over a period the institute has developed a reputation for constantly providing an objective record of world-wide military holdings. I hope that is the case. The Minister mentioned specifically this report at a recent meeting of the European affairs committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's view which he presented at committee. Reading through the report and the history of US inspections in Iraq from 1991 to 1998, it certainly is a very worrying situation, as the Minister has set out. If Deputy Higgins can assist the House to find other forms of independent assessment, I would like to see them put on the record of the House and made available to us. I will not lead my party into making a decision on this important issue based on anti-American rhetoric or on the sort of nonsense we normally hear in this House from self-serving politicians who have denuded this State of any basic form of protection. I will return to that issue later because I am very worried about it. It is something about which this House should be greatly concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be in opposition for a long time.</P>
      <P>Another pillar of our approach must be to stand up to terrorism and tackle injustice. We must make it clear that we stand with civilised democratic states and against demagogues and dictators. In particular we must remember the enormity of what happened on 11 September last year in the United States and the ongoing campaign of terrorism as demonstrated in the Yemen and Bali. However, terrorism can only be reduced and eliminated if the injustices it feeds off are tackled and ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other great source of conflict and injustice in the Middle East is the plight of the Palestinian and Jewish people. It is not credible or proper to threaten action against Iraq for flouting UN resolutions while Israel is allowed to continue to flout a whole series of such resolutions. I recognise the destructive contribution made by Palestinian suicide bombers to the misery of the region. However, this cannot be allowed to be used as an excuse for inaction. President Bush could learn from his father, George Bush senior, <Col N="35" />who pressurised Israel into talks and concessions as an essential prerequisite to the construction of the Gulf War coalition. On a more global level, Ireland must play its part. The European affairs committee has already set up an advisory group under the chairmanship of David Begg, Secretary General of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. When its report comes before the committee, and later this House, we should use it as a basis to try to get the Irish Government to make the elimination of injustice internationally our primary objective during Ireland's EU Presidency in 2004.</P>
    <P>We must not allow knee-jerk anti-Americanism to dictate our attitude to the Iraqi crisis. It has always struck me as odd that so many in this country welcomed American involvement in the peace process while condemning so-called American interference in any other situation where the US Government gets involved. The United States played a major part in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement and in bringing peace to this island. Over the years, it has welcomed our emigrants and its businessmen have invested heavily in our country, with all its implications for employment here. I do not suggest that we should be beholden or blinded by the US, nor do I suggest that we should by bought by it.</P>
    <P>However, I suggest that we should be fair in our assessment. Srebrenica was not sorted out by neutrals such as Ireland or even by the European Union. It was sorted out by NATO, led by the US while cowardly, self-serving European politicians, many of them on this island, spoke in the most hypocritical and unpardonable manner imaginable. Not even the atrocities of Srebrenica moved them from their self-serving and self-satisfied outpourings. Sinn Féin again attacked the US in this Chamber yesterday. This is the same Sinn Féin who swan around the White House, the State Department and Congress at every opportunity. I sincerely hope the US authorities take close note of how they are repaid here by the Sinn Féin self-serving rhetoric. We need an independent assessment of Ireland and Europe's security and defence needs. This will not come about as a result of courageous leadership in this House because we have in the main been cowed into outbidding each other by eulogising neutrality to the advantage of politicians while denuding the people of even the basic capacity for self-defence on this island.</P>
    <P>Prior to 11 September the American public was quite cosy about the fact that their internal flights lacked any form of real security. They found out to their horror the price they had to pay for this. We are similarly cosy about our neutrality. However, unlike other neutral states, we have not provided to defend our neutrality, therefore we are probably the least defended State in the whole of Europe. If we knew a plane taking off from anywhere within or outside our jurisdiction was to be used to target either a facility within the State or outside the State, such as Sellafield, which would have disastrous consequences for us, <Col N="36" />we do not have the capacity to deal with such a situation, even if we had notice in advance. Here we are, soon to have the second highest <i>per capita</i> income in the European Union of 27 member states, and our Government has failed to do its first duty, that is, to provide for the security of its citizens. This is an appalling lack of leadership.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to appoint a committee of wise persons to independently examine the security needs of Ireland and Europe and to report directly to Dáil Éireann, not to the Government. Such a committee should examine the role Ireland should play as one of the architects in bringing about a security architecture in Europe which will meet our concerns and needs. We have been running away from this issue for far too long. This is an issue of urgent public policy and concern and should be addressed without further delay.</P>
    <P>The European Union should consider what its contribution should be to Iraq when it is freed ultimately of the dictatorship of Sadam Hussein. Recently, the Iraqi people were forced in a so-called referendum where they had to show their votes publicly, to give a 100% endorsement to Sadam Hussein. Is this the action of a free people? The three main elements of Iraqi society, Sunni Muslims, Shi-ite Muslims and Kurds, are kept together within the Iraqi borders by a mixture of cajoling and oppression. Secession from any state has serious implications for neighbouring states. Secession from Iraq could have serious implications for Turkey, Iran and other parts of the region. The European Union is heavily involved in the Middle East in trying to bring about a settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis. The European Union should now examine ways and means to assist Iraq in the event that Sadam Hussein falls. This consideration should commence now if it is not already under way.</P>
    <P>We as parliamentarians have a serious duty to consider all the implications of the issues now facing the Security Council. It is not sufficient to wait and see which way the Government may hop and then react to events either by criticising or, in high moral tone, sitting in judgment on others. This House must be as fully informed as possible on developments so that we can give the Government guidance and, if necessary, authorise decisions to be taken at the Security Council, and possibly here at home, which are based on principles. I hope the principles I have outlined in this debate will be considered by the Government and that when the time comes, as it probably will, for a decision by Ireland on the role of the United Nations in Iraq, we will be in a position to make an informed decision based on reason, good judgment and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>Lack of time prevents me from quoting extracts from an article by Patrick Smith in <i>The Irish Times </i>on 14 September but I commend it to Members of the House. It shows clearly that we can no longer continue with the rhetoric which sufficed in the past. We can no longer hide in the <Col N="37" />crowd. We are now faced with serious decisions which may confront us within days. I ask the House to give this issue the consideration it deserves and I ask the Government to set before the House the basis for its authorisation to our representative on the Security Council for his vote when that stage is reached in the very near future. Our response to the evolving situation must be a considered one.</P>

      <P>Last weekend, the Government and parties on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side in the Nice referendum claimed, fraudulently, that if the Irish people voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; they were inserting neutrality into our Constitution. Many will wonder how that is compatible with the involvement of Shannon Airport in preparations for war by American military forces. Those preparations are continuing this week, with US soldiers wandering around the airport terminal in desert fatigues. Clearly, they are preparing for war against Iraq. It is amazing to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs deliver a speech including all the usual fine-sounding words but without any mention of the Americans' use of Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>Having heard the Minister's speech, the Green Party is greatly concerned the Irish Government will support military action against Iraq. This concern is based on the fact that the Government has facilitated both the Gulf war and the war against Afghanistan by allowing hundreds of military aircraft to use Shannon Airport and Irish airspace. The assistance given to the Afghan war was done without Dáil approval and contrary to Article 28.3.1º of the Constitution. This concern is also based on the uncritical support given so far to President Bush's war on terrorism. While Ireland held the chairmanship of the UN Security Council, our Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that Ireland not only supported the war against Afghanistan but would consider supporting an extension of that war to other countries. The US Ambassador to the UN, John Negroponte, delivered a letter to the UN Security Council on 8 October 2001 stating: &ldquo;We may find that our self-defence requires further actions with respect to other organisations and other states.&rdquo; At that time, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, stated: &ldquo;As of now, the threat has been identified in Afghanistan. If there were evidence to suggest that other regimes were a threat to international peace and security, such action would be admissible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vitally important that the Government uses its last few months on the UN Security Council to uphold the UN Charter and reassert some semblance of independence in Ireland's foreign policy. The Green Party calls on the Government to pursue the following policies in relation to Iraq in the UN Security Council. It should oppose any <Col N="38" />UN resolution enabling military action to be taken against Iraq. It should argue that such a resolution would be contrary to the UN Charter. Iraq has not attacked anyone and is not threatening to attack anyone. International law does not allow for pre-emptive military strikes. Article 51 of the UN Charter outlines the terms under which a member state may use force in self-defence, but this force cannot be used in the absence of an attack. There is no evidence of any Iraqi involvement in the 11 September atrocities. The UN Charter does not authorise the use of force to achieve a change of regime, as indeed the Minister has noted. That is merely another word for assassination and any US-UN action based on targeting Saddam Hussein would be illegal.</P>
    <P>Ireland should work to secure the lifting of sanctions against Iraq. I visited Iraq last year on a delegation with the Minister's predecessor, the former Deputy David Andrews, and we saw the effects of sanctions at first hand. It is not a myth, it is happening on the ground. The devastating effects of sanctions on the Iraqi people have been well documented. The present comprehensive economic sanctions have been targeting the entire population of Iraq. They have created a major economic and public health crisis in a country which, prior to the Gulf War, enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the region. UNICEF estimates that half a million Iraqi children have died as a result of sanctions and about 5,000 people are dying every month. Ireland should insist on the lifting of comprehensive economic sanctions and a shift towards targeted sanctions. This is called for by such groups as Save the Children and in reports for the UN sponsored by the Swiss and German Governments, including the Interlaken process and the Bonn-Berlin processes. These indicate how sanctions could be better targeted on the arms trade and on the personal finances and travel of responsible leaders and elites.</P>
    <P>Such targeted sanctions were imposed briefly by the Security Council in Resolution 1137 of November 1997, prohibiting international travel of listed leaders until full compliance with UNSCOM inspectors had been restored. This was followed by swift Iraqi compliance. Such targeted sanctions should have built-in time limits and clear criteria for lifting or modifying them. Regular humanitarian assessments must be part of any sanctions regime. Free trade, excepting military goods, should be re-established.</P>
    <P>Foreign investments in Iraq should be permitted. The need for the removal of all weapons of mass destruction from the region should be highlighted. Resolution 687 on Iraq in 1991 established UNSCOM to investigate and destroy Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and UNSCOM has since been replaced by a new monitoring, verification and inspection commission, UNMOVIC, under Resolution 1284.</P>
    <P>In the short time remaining to me in this debate, I wish to put some questions to the Minister. I ask him to clarify the statement made by <Col N="39" />Ambassador Ryan on 17 October 2002 concerning Iraq. It is not clear from that statement whether Ireland is supporting the US approach based on a single resolution calling for arms inspectors, full Iraqi compliance and the possibility of full military action in default or the alternative approach, favoured by France in particular, on the basis of two distinct resolutions, one calling for Iraqi compliance and providing for inspections and, if Iraq fails to comply, a second resolution which would authorise the use of force. I urge the Minister to clarify the Irish position on this very important matter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if the Taoiseach has had recent direct contact with President Bush concerning the war on terrorism? Has there been direct contact concerning the proposed UN Security Council resolution on Iraq? If not, does the Taoiseach expect any such contact? Those are very important questions which I urge the Minister to have clarified. In his speech, the Minister said Ireland is committed to a pacific settlement. I ask him to prove to the House that those are not just words and that the commitments of the Constitution will be honoured.</P>

      <P>It is beyond dispute that civilians in Iraq have suffered profound deprivation and hardship as a result of the last Gulf war and the ongoing sanctions. The UNICEF situation analysis of children and women in Iraq found that sanctions have caused the deaths of 90,000 Iraqi people every year since the war. The increase in mortality for Iraqi children under the age of five is mainly due to diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malnutrition. More than one million Iraqi children are chronically malnourished. Malnutrition was not a problem prior to the embargo. The lack of safe water has also contributed greatly to the steep rise in mortality rates. Water treatment plants that were working properly and effectively prior to the embargo now lack spare parts, equipment and treatment chemicals. Despite the increased need, Iraq now lacks even basic hospital and healthcare equipment.</P>
      <P>Prior to the embargo, healthcare reached 97% of the population. The oil for food plan has not reduced the widespread suffering and has not provided the needed supplies in full, nor in a timely manner. It has not resulted in adequate protection for Iraq's children from malnutrition and disease. Those children who are spared from death continue to remain deprived of essential rights under the Convention of the Rights of the Child. The idea that Ireland, through failure to properly use our role on the Security Council to prevent war or by allowing our island to be used as a way station for troops on their way to attack Iraq, could be participating even if only through our acquiescence in worsening the situation for the Iraqi people is an appalling vista.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opinion polls showed that the Irish people do not want another war with Iraq, and that Ireland should vote against any UN Security Council res<Col N="40" />olution authorising military action. I appeal to the Government to heed those sentiments. They are being reflected around the world in a growing anti-war movement. In the US it is now of proportions not reached since the Vietnam War.</P>
    <P>Given the high stakes of the crisis and the national importance of this issue we requested a full debate on the first Order of Business when the House reconvened two months ago. This request was denied by the Government. The House has still not properly debated this crucial issue. Today, despite assurances of a full debate by the Taoiseach last week, there is only an anaemic round of statements. Following these the Government will likely continue to do as it pleases on this issue of critical national importance, in defiance of both the Irish people and the Constitution. This is a disgrace and makes a mockery of the pre-Nice referendum assurances about protecting and defending Irish neutrality, and it cannot be allowed to go ahead.</P>
    <P>We need a full public debate and at a bare minimum the Government needs to seek Dáil consent to any participation in war, whether preparatory or otherwise. We call on the Government to strongly oppose the launching of a new war against Iraq by the US and British Governments. It must use all its political and diplomatic resources in the UN and EU to promote a peaceful solution. Ireland must use its role on Security Council to prevent this war.</P>
    <P>In keeping with our stance on neutrality, Sinn Féin also calls on the Government to immediately cease the practice of giving permission to foreign states to refuel, re-supply, and train military aircraft in Irish airports and airspace, and to prevent the use of Irish seaports for their naval vessels. We welcome the French and Russian initiatives and, in particular, their willingness to stand up and be counted on this issue. Ireland must do the same.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, Sinn Féin wants to see multilateral nuclear disarmament and the standing down of all weapons of mass destruction. We believe that this view is shared widely in the House and in Ireland. However, we firmly believe that another war in Iraq is most emphatically not the way to achieve this objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been used for many years to seeing the cringing subservience of Irish Governments to the position of the United States Administration of the day. However, I have hardly ever heard such a faithful and complete regurgitation of the position of the United States State Department as I heard today from the Minister for Foreign Affairs supported by the Fine Gael spokesperson. No serious observer of the global geo-political situation believes that the United States wants to wage war or Iraq either to grant democratic rights to the Iraqi people or because of alleged weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the United States is concerned about democratic rights in the Middle East why does it routinely support virtually every dirty dictatorship in <Col N="41" />the region except Iraq? Why, in particular, does it support the obscurantist, anti-woman, corrupt, anti-democratic, murderous feudal regime in Saudi Arabia? If it respects democratic rights why are there people still in positions of influence in United States politics who master minded the coup in Chile in 1973 against a democratically elected Government? This coup slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children.</P>
    <P>When President Bush's favourite European poodle Tony Blair, who specialises in running along at the heels of his master, presented at a few hours notice so-called evidence or proof of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq many experts derided the document. It was devoid of proof of the existence of these weapons or of the capacity of such weapons if they did exist. What was the capacity of Iraq during the Gulf War? A few Scud missiles, badly targeted, was as much as could be mustered. Even if there were some such weapons which could be delivered outside of Iraq it would be impossible for Saddam Hussein to use them because he would be blitzed into the stone age by the western powers. In fact, there is much more danger that any weapons which are there will be used in the event of an attack by the United States and Britain. Such an attack would precipitate a retaliation.</P>
    <P>Where was the United States when the world held its breath as India and Pakistan were threatening us with a war involving tactical nuclear weapons a short time ago? Why was the emphasis not on disarming that very real threat at the time? </P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the war against Iran. Who supported Saddam Hussein? Who armed him? Who supplied him with the weapons for that murderous war? The western powers, of course. Even when he committed the most appalling genocide against the Kurdish people in Halabaja with German mustard gas, they continued to arm him because he was their cat's paw in the region at the time.</P>
    <P>What is this war for? The national security strategy, outlined on 17 September, says clearly what it is for, namely, that the United States will brook no rival to its economic and military power. To paraphrase Shakespeare, referring to Caesar, the United States now wants to bestride the narrow world like Colossus and carry on the weapons of its military the economic demands for super profits by its multi-national corporations.</P>
    <P>Opposition to war is widespread and deep in the country. Deputy Mitchell is correct to say that Irish people do not put faith in the UN Security Council, in particular in the five permanent members. Who can have confidence in Russia or China, which have appalling records, to protect civil rights? The Minister chose to outline the Iraqi regime's crimes, and they should be outlined, but he ignored the crimes of the United States over several decades and their current crime in supporting the murderous repression of the Palestinian people by Israel. The interference <Col N="42" />of the imperial powers has been disastrous for the Arab peoples for generations and centuries. They robbed their resources and continue to support and arm the most vicious regimes. Removing Saddam Hussein is a matter for the Iraqi people. An uprising of the Iraqi people is made much more difficult by the policies of the United States and the western powers. When the Kurds in the north and the Shias in the south did rise up after the Gulf War, the western powers deliberately stood aside and allowed Saddam Hussein to murderously crush them because they put so-called stability and a unified Iraq before the democratic rights of the component parts of that state.</P>
    <P>There is only one useful thing the imperial powers can do for the region, namely to get out and leave the resources of the Middle East to the democratic control of its peoples. Let them work at bringing about a democratic, socialist federation of states where they can exchange their resources between them and the rest of the world. A war on Iraq would be disastrous. The leader of the Arab league said that it would open the gates of hell. This is not only true in relation to the Iraqi people but also in the effect it would have on the Arab world, pushing more and more Arab nations &ndash; in desperation, anger and humiliation &ndash; into the arms of the horrific reactionary fundamentalists who are waiting in the wings. That this State should have any hand, act or part in such a war is monstrous and unthinkable. Facilities in Shannon should be withdrawn immediately so this State can stand in front of the world and tell the truth about the intentions of the United States. The will of the people has been clearly enunciated recently in an opinion poll which shows they do not support this action.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. It is sad we have so little time to discuss it. When I was first elected to the Dáil, an item like this could have taken hours for discussion and would not have been regarded as a waste of time. It would have been given the appropriate treatment. However, I am glad so many people have taken the opportunity to contribute briefly to indicate their position.</P>
      <P>The number of people who are now against war and, in particular, unilateral action by the US or the US and Britain, probably far exceeds the recent &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on the Nice treaty and is probably twice the size of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. Many of those, like myself, who are in favour of the admission of ten new member states to the European Union in the shortest possible time are also strongly against war.</P>
      <P>Even after 20 years in this House, I still have to again draw the distinction between opposition to United States foreign policy of the day and anti-Americanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have worked and studied in a number of universities in the US and I find it a <Col N="43" />cheap accusation. In the 1980s, I raised the use of mustard gas by Saddam Hussein against the Kurds and I was not supported by many people as it was regarded as being of little interest. I am neither anti-American nor pro-Saddam and the evidence is there to show it. I am a critic of current American foreign policy in the same way as I was a critic of Reagan's foreign policy when I saw its consequences first hand in Central America while slíbhíns from the Dáil were drinking gin and tonic in the US Embassy and listening to imported liars.</P>
      <P>I found the Minister's speech interesting, if so clever at times as to be ambiguous. For example, when he refers to the legal basis for action which is at the heart of our discussion, he gives a list of the UN resolutions and I do not agree with his interpretation of them. He refers to the set of resolutions governing the no-fly zone as having commenced a set of operations in relation to the no-fly zone. What the Minister must know clearly, and he might admit it, is that there was no legal basis for that particular action. That is why the action was taken outside international law or appropriate interpretation of resolutions of the Security Council. France desisted from it at the end of the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech reads:</P>
      <P>In another resolution passed the same month, the Security Council condemned the Iraqi regime's brutal repression of its civilian population and demanded an end to it. They did. Allied forces set up no-fly zones with the express intention of protecting the Kurds and the marsh Shia Arabs.</P>
      <P>That is where the argument as to where the legal basis lies. I will return to this point.</P>
      <P>The more important issue is that the integrity of the Security Council has been extraordinarily damaged by the speeches and actions of Tony Blair and Jack Straw. Why can the Minister so easily write a speech about the integrity of the Security Council and not make any reference to the fact that when Hans Blix sets up a regime for the return of the weapons inspectors, the goal posts are changed without reference to the Security Council by the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary? Jack Straw recently said that Britain would abide by a mandate if the Security Council passes the appropriate resolution. This has a serious impact on international law. There are several references in the Minister's speech, and I agree with many of his points, in relation to how an international jurisprudence defends small countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it that there has been no legal basis for some of the actions that have been directed against Iraq, particularly the abuse of the resolution which established the no-fly zone. The issue concerns Resolutions 678, 686 and 687. Resolution 686 derives authority from 678, but 687 explicitly does not. This is an old issue which I remember discussing with Iraqi diplomats. How <Col N="44" />would one know, dealing with such people, that a war was ever over? If one argues that there has not been a breach by Iraq &ndash; which there has been &ndash; in relation to what the inspectors might do, it violates some conditions of a ceasefire. One must then look at the resolutions governing the conflict with Kuwait and the limitations of that. If one can justify a pre-emptive strike on the basis of breach of conditions of a ceasefire, why do we not immediately bomb North Korea on the basis that the armistice of 1953 has been breached? There is not a shred of international law to support the statements that have been made by Jack Straw, Tony Blair and many people in the Bush Administration.</P>
    <P>One of the most important elements in all of this is international law. The United Nations Charter itself expressly states in its preamble that the purpose of the UN is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to practice tolerance and to live together in peace as good neighbours. In Articles 2 and 3 it sets out the procedures that should be used for the settlement of disputes. When international lawyers examine whether there is a legal basis for a strike against Iraq, they examine the body of the UN Charter and rightly point out that if one is to invoke, for example, Article 51 which deals with self-defence, any actions taken later under Article 42 to implement a particular resolution of the Security Council is still in the spirit of Article 51. Let us call a spade a spade. One cannot have a pre-emptive strike and be within the charter. One cannot take a unilateral or bilateral action and be within the charter even under the threat of self-defence. Most legal opinion would argue that the threat must be imminent and proximate and that therefore the defence itself should be proportionate.</P>
    <P>Where is all the evidence that linked Iraq to the appalling destruction of life at the twin towers? What has happened that evidence? Vaclav Havel has gone to the trouble of pointing out that the meeting which was supposed to have taken place between Mr. Atta and a senior Iraqi intelligence official never took place. I recall many other things as well. In the last war, for example, the story about the Iraqi soldiers switching off incubators in Kuwait turned out to be an invention. In all of this there is an absence of evidence with allegation and spun stories by those who are as committed to operating outside of the UN charter as anybody has ever been.</P>
    <P>There are other issues. Can world peace be assured by Iraqi compliance? Saddam has been a disaster all the days of his leadership and I have said that consistently for 20 years. I saw the children waiting in hospitals suffering from leukaemia and from the absence of medicines. Yes, he is responsible for some of the medical supplies but what about the multinational companies that won supply contracts in a complex and corrupt process? They supplied out of date medicines, <Col N="45" />equipment with pieces missing and left hospitals unable to operate.</P>
    <P>There is a notion that if the position in Iraq is righted we will be able to get on with peace. There is a point to what my colleague Deputy Jim Higgins said in relation to the US national energy policy. I presume he was referring to the 2001 report. The Minister is into &ldquo;context&rdquo; today. I will add some context too. The context, for example, is that the United States needs 20 million barrels of crude oil a day. Iraq is about the second largest reserve of oil in the Middle East, next to Saudi Arabia. I am not so naive as to assume the Russian delegation to the United Nations is not entirely conscious of the $7 billion Soviet era debt that hangs around or of the $20 billion contract negotiated in 1997. Consider too France's contracts in relation to Iraqi oil. I am sure President Bush is advised by international jurists who are not a bit interested in oil and that he leaves all that to Vice-President Cheney, who was after all one of the principal oil barons before his conversion to politics, of a sort. If we want context it is interesting to ask about oil.</P>
    <P>There are other issues in the region. A war in the region would be catastrophic not just in terms of human life but ecologically for generations to come. It would destabilise not just the immediate region but would have the capacity to turn into something worse. I am more than 20 years a political scientist. When I went to the United States in 1966 Mr. Huntington, one of the most quoted writers, was writing bad articles on the modernisation of the world. He has written a much worse book since then which suggested the crash of civilisations.</P>
    <P>What could happen in Iraq should a war take place could encourage a confrontation between the western world and what is regarded as some kind of evil. The historical ignorance which is being brought to bear here is extraordinary. Those of us who have visited the Middle East and those of us aware of the history of the people of Iraq and the history of the Mesopotamian region know the people had a culture and that they made a contribution to mathematics, scholarship, literature and music when many of the countries in the western world barely existed. I find it offensive and racist when people say they have a form of democracy which they will impose on this region. Of course that will bring oil security while they do it.</P>
    <P>I have seen one report, not an official document, in regard to the possible future role of General Franks as some kind of Mountbatten in the region who would pay for what would be regarded as the imposition of a US approved democracy from oil receipts. This is something friends should talk to friends about. We have a friendly relationship with the United States, there is much foreign direct investment here and there has been a welcome interest in Northern Ireland. Why is it morally necessary that we have to set up something to tell friends internationally something that is uncomfortable and unpalatable, <Col N="46" />something that must keep being mediated and balanced against other interests.</P>
    <P>The reality is that a connection has not been established between the attack on the twin towers and Iraq. The meetings that were alleged to have taken place in the Czech Republic did not take place. Tony Blair offered to produce evidence but has not done so. A Republican representative from Texas stood up and asked questions. Are we not deflecting resources from the approach to terrorism by pursuing will-o'-the-wisp connections between terrorism and Iraq?</P>
    <P>What about the children and people of Iraq? I have been to Iraq more than once and I was not as interested in resuming beef exports as some of the others who were with me. We sold beef to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war. Now it is time to put the people first. One woman wrote to me the other day with a prayer for peace in Iraq.</P>
    <P>International legal opinion relies principally on a document prepared at Matrix Chambers by Rabinder Singh and Alison Mc Donald. Matrix Chambers is where Cherie Blair practises. To be fair and accurate another document has issued from there which does not agree entirely with Rabinder Singh's analysis. The point however is that it concludes that there is not a basis for attacking Iraq.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the thrust of the United Nations charter and Article 2 which mentions the settlement of international disputes. The main issue is whether we can put automaticity into a resolution. By this I mean we would word a single text that would say the inspectors will return under clarified and redefined conditions and should there be no compliance all reasonable means, force and military strike, will happen. That automaticity was discussed before in the United Nations Security Council and Sweden and other countries said it broke the principle of the Security Council's integrity and right to call the shots.</P>
    <P>What is necessary for the inspectors to return is the Security Council's integrity to be respected. Then, when the Security Council reports, let us hear from Tony Blair and President Bush that they are committed to accepting that process and not Jack Straw's suggestion that we will go along with it if we get what we want. That was his statement. He did not say he would wait until the inspectors' report is available to the Security Council. The pre-emptive strike force would be and is illegal. The interpretation of Article 51, through Article 31 of the Vienna convention, is clear. These matters have been discussed before. It is not a case of the Security Council not being able to act. It has acted five times in the past eight years authorising the use of force. I agree with the Minister when, in a flourish at the end of his speech, he said that small countries tend to benefit under the rules of international law. Now is the time to vindicate that and tell those who would take unilateral action. Were they to do so with even the slightest suggestion of approval from us, we would have delivered a mortal blow to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" />We should remember who left UNESCO when it was suggested in the McBride report that people from what is regarded as the south should have the right to communicate on the same terms as the north. Britain and the United States went marching out. The United Nations Security Council, of which we are a member, has been bullied, as have Hans Blix and his team and the people of Ireland. The time has come for us to say we support the principle and ethos of the charter.</P>
    <P>I say that without fear of any abuse people may give me. I know from members of my family that thousands of people in the United States feel the same way and that this type of unilateral action does not speak for them. They find it difficult to get any space in the media. How well Rupert Murdoch serves Tony who took his shilling. They have a lovely relationship. I never thought the time would come at my age when we would have such intolerance and media exclusion and where we would not be free and would be abused if we held a view in favour of peace. There is no coverage of our peace meetings throughout the country or of demonstrations against war. The attitude is that, instead of listening, going through the charter and examining the history of the region and what interests are at stake, one abuses one's opponents. It is a case of being either with us or against us. That is appalling.</P>
    <P>However, more than two out of three people in Ireland are still interested in having something which would be an alternative to a $90 billion war. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others were in Johannesburg and know what it takes to provide clean water throughout the planet, to eradicate most of the communicable diseases and they know the cost of a war. I agree with previous speakers that the time has come where, if we get past this point and, I hope, we have stepped back and the inspectors' work will be able to be completed properly, we should proceed with the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and the deflection of resources and intelligence towards the task of building the type of world envisaged in the charter where we might live with each other in tolerance and as good neighbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the position and welcome the tone of his speech. I also thank him for his tireless efforts on behalf of the people to bring about a resolution to the crisis in Iraq through the UN Security Council and multilateral co-operation generally. We should also record our gratitude to the work done by our diplomats abroad, especially in the United Nations. As a result of their endeavours, Ireland is held in high regard by other countries and we have gained an influence in international relations which is not warranted on the basis of our size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in Iraq represents a threat to the peace and security of the Middle East and <Col N="48" />consequently to the world. We are all obliged to try to find a peaceful solution to this problem and I welcome the Minister's assurances that Ireland intends to pursue this under the terms of the UN Charter through the UN Security Council. Any unilateral action by the USA would only serve to exacerbate the problem and threaten world peace and security. It is interesting to note that a number of EU member states also hold this view.</P>
    <P>Iraq has consistently failed to meet its obligations under international law and UN Security Council resolutions. Its decision to admit weapons inspectors must be welcomed. However, I share the Minister's caution in this regard and the sincerity of this move remains to be seen. I know discussions are ongoing on the modalities of this access, especially where the presidential sites are concerned. I hope progress can be made on these issues quickly.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for outlining Ireland's approach to the proposed new resolution. He referred to the fact that there is a strong political case for reaffirming and strengthening the UN mandate on this issue. He went on to say that all members agree that, if Iraq refuses to meet these conditions, the Security Council must assume its reponsibilities. He stated that Ireland very much wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis and further stated that we do not see that there is a UN mandate for any further end, such as a regime change. Such a change would be welcome, however, having regard to the repression in that country, its engagement in regional wars and the abuse of human rights generally. The Minister also stated that the resolution must be firm, clear and fair. We are under no illusions about our approach in this regard at the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that any further non-compliance by Iraq will be viewed seriously by the Security Council and result in a stronger resolution being agreed. I hope for the sake of the Iraqi people that military force under a UN mandate can be avoided. As a result of the present sanctions, the ordinary Iraqi people face a difficult humanitarian situation and the lifting of sanctions in due course would greatly benefit them. The Iraqi leadership had it in its power to avoid this crisis.</P>
    <P>I have always supported Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. We must be clear, however, about what this means. Our policy in this regard and the avoidance of military alliances generally do not allow us to opt out of our obligations as a member of the United Nations. This raises the question of refuelling facilities for US airplanes at Shannon Airport. I support the decision of the Government to allow this following the 11 September attacks on the USA. As a member of the UN and of the Security Council, Ireland has a responsibility to implement Security Council resolutions and to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" />There is a perceived conflict between our policy of military neutrality and our obligations under the UN Charter and this should be appreciated. The avoidance of military alliances does not mean that we remain in splendid isolation and avoid multilateral co-operation for the resolution of international disputes. However, I propose that any new permissions for refuelling facilities arising out of the UN Security Council resolutions to which we subscribe should be brought to the Dáil for approval.</P>

      <P>Many UN Security Council resolutions are passed and subsequently ignored. This is most unsatisfactory. The Oireachtas should become more involved in this issue and should scrutinise these resolutions. There is a role for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in this regard. I have not been a member of that committee and it may be that it does this. However, it should do it in a comprehensive way in the interests of our foreign policy and ensuring international law prevails throughout the world. Ireland should do everything that is practically possible to ensure that UN Security Council resolutions are implemented. I know that will be our policy and role in the years ahead.</P>

I am here to defend my own and be held accountable for the foreign policy I pursue on behalf of the Government. Parliament is here to hold me accountable. The Executive, under our Constitution, is there to pursue our foreign policy. That is the way our Constitution works and I am very open to it. When I set out my position, I set out the position of the Irish Government and am not acting at the behest of any other government.</P>

The issue I am dealing with is the situation in the United Nations regarding the compliance with Security Council resolutions in this matter. That is what I am dealing with and not anything else.

      <P>I will deal with the points raised by Deputies that are relevant and I thank them for raising them. Deputy Gay Mitchell asked when we might expect a draft resolution to be tabled. Sometime during the week I expect a draft resolution to be tabled. As Deputies will be aware no draft resolution has been tabled yet. We cannot give a position on any resolution until it is tabled, but we will study it carefully when that happens. I have advised the House of the principles that will inform our position in relation to that resolution and what I have enunciated is consistent with the position of successive governments in relation to our broad foreign policy position, which is to uphold, as Deputy Michael Higgins said, the primacy of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley asked me to uphold the Charter. I certainly will uphold the Charter in all of its aspects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In this regard I refer the Deputy to article 42 of the Charter, to which he omitted <Col N="51" />to refer in his contribution. This allows for the fact that unfortunately there can be circumstances, which I hope will be avoidable, under the UN Charter when the Security Council can legitimately seek the use of military action to enforce compliance with Security Council resolutions. That is also upholding the Charter. It is also upholding the Charter to ensure that we meet our obligations as members of the United Nations to ensure compliance with and enforcement of existing Security Council resolutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gormley does not like to hear answers outlining the position. I am as interested in upholding the legality of the position as anybody else. I have decided to practice law when I get the opportunity and no longer have the privilege of being in this House or holding ministerial office. I give substance to the importance of upholding the international legal position. The Government in all its efforts so far and in its continuing discussions formally and informally at official level, political level and at the UN, is making these points.</P>
      <P>We are glad an opportunity is being given to the multilateral system to ensure that its credibility can be upheld and respected in the face of those who will defy it. Here is an opportunity for the multilateral system to show it works and that it can muster the collective political will to put to those who are in defiance of its resolutions the necessity to comply on the basis of a clear fair resolution to be put to them once again. If people are interested in maintaining the international legal order, let them be prepared not only to subscribe to it in principle but to put it into practice and to meet our responsibilities and obligations.</P>
      <P>This is my central point in reply to this debate. I refer Deputies to the speech of Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, to the general Assembly in September. What he says in that speech I totally and unequivocally support in all of its aspects. Let those who are interested in upholding the primacy of the United Nations read and study that speech by a multilateralist of conviction and purpose who is prepared to work with might and main, day and night to provide a political and diplomatic solution to this problem within the UN framework and within the international legal order. Let those, who think they will test the will of the international community by continuing to defy it, not be under the mistaken belief that the United Nations will not &ndash; as the United Nations Secretary General said it must &ndash; discharge its responsibilities should that time and circumstance come to pass. It is something we will all seek to avoid and seek to ensure it is not required.</P>

      <P>Let nobody who talks about upholding the United Nations Charter in this or any other forum, suggest that in all cases the prospect of military action is eliminated under international law. It is not. That is not to say one hopes the day will come when it will be used. I have stated in my speech clearly and unambiguously that we seek to resolve this matter diplomatically and politically. We are doing everything we can to ensure our influence is such that we bring about a situation whereby a resolution, if put, will be one that will bring unity to the Security Council and will enable the legitimacy of the Security Council to be respected and will also involve the elements that are required to enhance upholding the international legal order and international law in dealing with this situation. Non-compliance with successive Security Council resolutions for a decade has brought us to the situation where Kofi Annan, as UN Secretary General, has insisted that we must discharge our responsibilities if this defiance continues.</P>
      <P>There have been important developments. There is a preparation on the part of the Iraqi regime to conduct discussions with Hans Blix and others to allow the inspectors in. Let us hope the outcome of those discussions will bring about the necessary co-operation to ensure compliance and does not require any further consideration by the Security Council.</P>

That could include the adoption of a further resolution authorising the use of force in the event of non-compliance. I have stated clearly what is our position. We want to see the UN respected. We want to see its primacy upheld by everybody. We want to see Iraq comply. We want to see a political and diplomatic solution. The international community will have to show common resolve in making sure that regime complies as it is required to do in international law to eliminate the threat to international peace and security, which its non-com<Col N="53" />pliance represents. The body to decide that in international law is the Security Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions in the past, Cabinet committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process. For that reason, while the Government is of course answerable for decisions arising from the work of Cabinet committees, questions as to the conduct of business at Cabinet or Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House. Among the reasons for this approach is the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      <P>The following are the Cabinet committees established by the Government: social inclusion, drugs and rural development; housing, infrastructure and public-private partnerships; children; health strategy; European affairs; and the information society.</P>
      <P>In relation to when they last met, the committee on social inclusion, drugs and rural development last met on 8 October. The committee on housing, infrastructure and public-private partnerships met on 26 June and again yesterday. The committee on children last met on 11 September. The committee on European affairs last met on 11 September and will meet again later today. The committee on the information society met on 16 October and arrangements are being made for a meeting of the committee on the health strategy.</P>
      <P>I chair the above committees with the exception of the committees on the health strategy and the information society. The membership of the Cabinet committee on the information society, in addition to myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, is as follows: the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Ministers for Finance; Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; Education and Science; Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; Social and Family Affairs; the Environment and Local Government; Health and Children; and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn tabled a question today for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs regarding the progress to date with implementation of the national drugs strategy, which was launched on 10 May, and extending drugs task forces and area-based partnerships. That question will be answered today and there is no difficulty with such questions. However, the Cabinet committee I chair is linked to the Cabinet process and when that is raised in a question I cannot answer. Last week we had a long debate on infrastructure, but if a question is asked in this way I cannot answer it whereas if a question is asked about infrastructure I can answer it.</P>
      <P>These issues are relevant to a line Minister and I cannot answer them, while if they come up under other areas I can. This issue has come up several times and there is a long precedent for it. Regarding Deputy Gregory's point, I have never answered questions on this. Questions dealing with the issues covered by Cabinet committee have to be put to line Ministers, while I can answer questions on general policy issues under other social partnership matters. That has been the position from the start.</P>

I will not be contentious about the matter but it seems to be a very rigid interpretation. We do not dispute the issue of Cabinet confidentiality, but there must be a greater degree of flexibility from the Chair in the interpretation of that rule. We hear that private individuals can attend and make presentations for public private partnerships and presumably tell the world and his wife and Joe Duffy what was involved and yet we cannot ask questions in the House.</P>

      <P>Arising from the recent ratification of the Nice treaty by the electorate, and in view of the fact that the convention will present its draft shortly and that will go to the next intergovernmental conference out of which will come a further treaty to be ratified by the people, is it intended to re-establish the Cabinet committee on European affairs or does the Taoiseach intend that the committee on European affairs will be able to keep the agenda on Europe going at a much higher level, including the facility extended to MEPs to address the Houses of the Oireachtas on European matters? As there is now widespread confusion about what can be delivered in the national development programme, is it intended that the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure will carry out a revised estimate and analysis of what can be delivered within available resources as we do not know what the budget deficit will be for next year?</P>

It will also be necessary for the committee of the House to deal with that issue from now on. Mr. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing will produce the draft papers next week. The Members of this House who are members of the convention will report to that committee. There will be an enormous amount of work for both committees.</P>

      <P>This is obviously a word game in which we must engage to try to find out how we get over the Taoiseach's defences in terms of addressing pressing issues. The pressing issue I would like addressed is the role of the NESF, its wider composition in terms of the makeup of the House and specifically the fact the NESF has exposed the gross inequalities in the health service, particularly the perpetuation of the two tier system of health care delivery which is perpetuated in the Government's health strategy. Has the Taoiseach discussed this report? It is clear he has not discussed it at the Cabinet committee on health but has he discussed it with the Minister for Health and Children? In support of my colleague from Monaghan, will the Taoiseach indicate when he intends to hold a meeting of the said Cabinet committee to address these pressing matters?</P>

      <P>The NESF is an important structure and it has done an enormous amount of good work. It is immensely important that the Oireachtas, or the party structure in the House, is represented. That is what the Chief Whip is engaged in and it is important that Oireachtas Members on the forum attend it.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe this is an adequate role for the Oireachtas in respect of the social partnership process? It is the only element of the social partnership process in which the Oireachtas, in any shape or form, has an input. From my previous experience on it, most of the social partnership decisions do not appear on the NESF agenda. It is a poor effort to include the Opposition parties in a process which is now dictating a great deal of the direction which this country and society takes. Does the Taoiseach agree we need to have much more robust political engagement in the social partnership process than we have had to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Several committees of the House deal with this matter not to mention the daily questioning of Ministers on issues arising from the PPF. Not a day goes by on Question Time or on the Order of Business that the PPF is not referred to in some form. It was referred to this morning by Deputy Quinn who raised the issue of redundancies. The Oireachtas is actively involved in this issue at Question Time and in the legislation which arises. I agree with Deputy Bruton that the NESF is not the only forum. The NESF is only one forum which deals with the social side and examines and considers the issues which affect the social aspects of social partnership. Oireachtas committees can engage with other social partners and other groups to raise issues which are part of the social partnership process. There is no reason the House cannot get involved in a more active way, but it has already moved in that direction compared with 15 years ago when the process started. The NESF has moved as part of that process but it is not the only way the Oireachtas has been involved.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach support a scenario whereby elements that referred to key Oireachtas committees would be referred to them for an input from Oireachtas Members into the developing partnership agreement before social partnership is signed off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as that can be done. Social partnership consists of negotiations between the social partners and the Government <Col N="65" />acting as a social partner, as it would because of pay and other aspects. The Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service could receive presentations on what is happening, but it would be impossible for the Oireachtas to become a negotiator. I do not think the Deputy is suggesting that, I think he is suggesting that the Oireachtas committees should be kept informed, and that is possible.</P>

      <P>I have to carefully consider how I go about asking my question. The NESF has produced a number of very valuable reports and given very focused insights into deficiencies in a raft of areas of social concern. In the recommendations it has put forward, and specifically in the report I referred to earlier on equity of access to hospital care, it questions the criteria for evaluating patients in order of their clinical priority. Will the Taoiseach act on this, or will he mandate the NESF to carry out this evaluation? Is this a function the NESF could better address?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans to hold further referendums. To date a number of the recommendations made by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution have been acted on. The more important recommendations in its sixth <Col N="66" />report in relation to the Referendum Commission and local government have also been implemented. The committee's recommendations on the abolition of reference to the death penalty in the Constitution was put to the people on 7 June 2001 and were passed, along with the establishment of an International Criminal Court on that same day.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that the fourth report of the committee &ndash; on the courts and the Judiciary &ndash; recommended the establishment of a judicial council. It was hoped to include this serious issue in the referendums to be held on 7 June 2001. However, it was not possible to get all-party agreement on this matter. With regard to the recommendations in the seventh report of the committee, at my request the Government Chief Whip has initiated consultations with political parties concerning participation in the Oireachtas by Northern Ireland representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that the all-party committee made a number of important recommendations, one of which was to strengthen the role of the Seanad in respect of Northern Ireland and cross-Border relations in general. The essential point of that recommendation was that four representatives should be appointed to the Seanad by the Taoiseach. Would the Taoiseach consider bringing forward some of these changes, in particular to assist the peace process and to help North-South co-operation in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reports, the one to which the Deputy referred and an earlier, more detailed one on Seanad reform, and I am in favour of examining both. I have asked my colleagues in the Seanad to start the process of examining these issues. We would have to consider both reports together because the balance of the original set-up of the Seanad in terms of the Taoiseach's nominees, the establishment of a Government majority and various other issues all becomes relevant. I agree with the Deputy's point, but it is impossible to achieve the implementation of the content of the second report without considering Seanad reform in its entirety. I am in favour of doing that in consultation with all the parties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made no decision on that and has not considered it since the election. I said in the last Dáil that the matter would have to be examined again in detail to see how it can be dealt with, and that remains the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is virtually certain that within the lifetime of this Government we will face another Constitutional amendment in respect of whatever emerges from the Intergovernmental Conference following the Convention on the Future of Europe. Would the Taoiseach therefore consider setting up a permanent system of information and communication, or does he see that being the role of the National Forum on Europe? What measures do the Government intend to take to build on the success of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the Nice referendum and to recognise the substantial number of people who, for whatever reason, have very serious reservations about where this country is going within the context of the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Taoiseach gives consideration to the continuation of the work of the National Forum on Europe. I suggest that once it becomes clear that a referendum must be held following the Intergovernmental Conference, the Referendum Commission should be set up as soon as possible. On this occasion the Referendum Commission was in a better position than before to assist people in having factual information about Nice, and more importantly, about what was not in the Nice treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in general agreement with what has been said. The National Forum on Europe must stay in place to continue its good work in involving people in an inclusive way in debate. It plays an important role in getting out and about in the community and engaging everybody. I have nothing against particular groups, but it is a debate that must be conducted in the broader community. It is important to keep this going and to continue communicating and informing. I would not be honest if I said I was not surprised in the past 18 months or so at the lack of understanding of or knowledge about many of the issues we in the Oireachtas feel are fairly basic. This is a fact of life, and we have to keep working on it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny about the Referendum Commission. In its report on the referendum of last March it makes the point that it did not have sufficient time and that the more time it gets the better. It got that time on this occasion.</P>
      <P>In addition, we in this House and in Government must work out how to engage in communicating the European message. We will be doing far more work in this House &ndash; I pay tribute to Deputy Quinn on his legislation and input into the whole process of how the House deals with European directives and legislation&mdash;</P>

      <P>As soon as possible I hope. I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs wants to proceed with it immediately. While we will be conducting a lot of business here, we have to find <Col N="68" />a new way of communicating that outside the Oireachtas. Without criticising anyone or anything in particular, it is a constant problem of this House that we communicate a small portion of everyday's business but we do not communicate many other issues.</P>
      <P>People in here will be busy dealing with important directives and legislation and there will be much more work in train in the next ten or 20 years with the activities of the Convention on the Future of Europe. Those of us who attend our group meetings can see how it is moving. That has to be communicated, otherwise we cannot get people here to devote time to it. The whole question of how we communicate our business generally, but in this case in respect of Europe, has to be thought out. Quite frankly, I do not think that is being done.</P>

      <P>In relation to future possible referenda or amendments to the Constitution, has the Taoiseach given any consideration to the suggestions from two former Taoisigh, Deputy John Bruton and Mr. Garret FitzGerald, that referenda are perhaps not the best way to deal with EU treaties? Would he be inclined to go consider attempting to modify the Constitution to ensure future treaties can be decided by the Oireachtas, without reference to the people, or would he &ndash; and I would prefer this &ndash; put a strong case at EU level that all EU treaties should be put to all the people of the EU? Which of those lines would he follow? Does he want to finish work begun in relation to neutrality and, if so, would a constitutional amendment be required before Ireland could join a military pact, apart from a European common defence, such as NATO? Has the Taoiseach noted in respect of the draft of a new European constitution that Deputy Bruton objected to provisions that would exclude countries which did not approve a draft EU constitution? Would he see that as requiring Government intervention at the convention to ensure the Irish Constitution does not become subservient to an EU constitution?</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Sargent, there is no other referendum pending. I have no doubt that what former Taoisigh and others have said about this will continue to be debated. However, we have a written Constitution and there are Supreme Court decisions and until those things are changed there is no other alternative. We all know the difficulty of putting complex questions and trying to explain them. That is the way it is in this country. We all have views about how these things could be done. That is how it is and I cannot see it being altered in any easy way but I have listened to many comments from the ordinary public in recent months. When they are given a treaty to consider, many would rather if we did not put them to the trouble. That is the way it is. We have to deal with the way it is and we have been doing that for many years.</P>

Bhí bóithre ina measc nach raibh ar liosta <i>a</i> nó <i>b</i>. An bhfuil an tAire sásta anois go raibh an ceart ag an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán an gníomh a dhéanamh ansin?

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The State of the West report, published by the Western Development Commission in July 2001, highlighted that poor infrastructure is the main barrier to development in the western region, with significant deficits in transport, power and telecommunications infrastructure being identified.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there have been significant achievements already in these areas. For example, spending on national roads in the WDC region nearly doubled in the period 1998 to 2001 as compared to the period 1994 to 1997, from &euro;190 million to &euro;366 million. The allocations on non-national roads also showed a significant increase for the same periods, from &euro;215 million to &euro;382 million. The total investment in rail infrastructure in the region during the past four years has been over &euro;50 million. There has also been major investment in telecommunications &ndash;&euro;18 million in the past four years.</P>
      <P>The CLÁR programme, which I initiated in the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, focuses on the major issues which are impacting on rural development as well as on the re-prioritisation of spending under the national development plan. A special dedicated fund of &euro;25.4 million is being made available for the period 2002-2003 and to date some &euro;20.3 million has been approved for measures under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised in the report were brought to the attention of relevant Ministers and I arranged for the Western Development Commission to <Col N="74" />meet the Taoiseach last January in relation to their concerns.</P>
    <P>Progress continues to be made under the national development plan on the improvement of infrastructure countrywide and not just in the west.</P>
    <P>As a person who has committed a lifetime to development in the west, I fully realise the need for further investment. I also realise that no matter how many infrastructural deficits and inadequacies are addressed, there will be many more waiting for attention. This will be all the more challenging in the current world economic climate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right when he says there will be more waiting for attention because while he outlined what has happened, the Fitzpatrick report published recently shows clearly that spending in the BMW region is only 75% of what it should be compared to the rate in the south and east region, which is 145% of the projected spend. That clearly shows that the BMW region is once again falling behind. How can the Minister say, therefore, that the Government is responding to the major infrastructure deficit highlighted in the State of the West report when it is obvious that the gap continues to widen, even up to the present day? Furthermore, only one quarter of all the projects in the infrastructure section of the NDP have started in the BMW region.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned the CLÁR programme, which has a dedicated fund of &euro;25 million. The Minister and I know that that is a minor rural development programme, effective in what it sets out to do but as a&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister suggest that we are catching up in the BMW region when only 75% of the spend on infrastructure has taken place there compared to 145% in the south and east region? What is the Minister's response to that? Furthermore, how can he state that CLÁR is an adequate response to the major infrastructure deficits highlighted in the State of the West report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves. The expenditure on roads in the BMW region &ndash; to which the Deputy is referring when quoting statistics &ndash; has doubled. That is a fact. Something that is very much in our favour in the west is that the cost of building a mile of road up to an adequate standard is much cheaper than in the southern and eastern regions. For example, to build a mile of the Knock bypass is much cheaper than building a mile of the M50. One of the <Col N="75" />advantages, therefore, that we have in the BMW region is that we will be able to do much more in the future for less euro per mile. I recognise, as a Minister from the west and as someone who is involved in the development of industry there, the serious problem with infrastructure. The Government's recognition of this problem informed the Taoiseach's decision to set up a dedicated ministry of rural development. As the Deputy is aware, that Department has only existed for the past four months and therefore its full impact is not felt.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the CLÁR programme. It always seems that people on both the east coast and the west coast want big infrastructure for the big people. That is why we end up spending so much time picking up the pieces in the RAPID areas in the inner city or the CLÁR areas in the countryside. As an ex-industrialist and somebody who is involved in development work and as a rural dweller, I am very conscious of the daily lives of the little people. To dismiss CLÁR, which is setting about making sure that every house in rural Ireland has proper piped water and a proper road going to the door, that the small places do not have to wait for all the big centres in the west to get their broadband infrastructure, that the two or three person industry has three-phase electricity, is to miss what the people of rural Ireland want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND" hpid="Ms Harkin Ms Harkin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was appointed to his present position he said he knew what the people of the west wanted and to set up a commission &ndash; the Western Development Commission &ndash; which could spend less than &euro;1 million per county per annum would only add to the number of agencies in the west and would not make any significant difference. How can he stand here today and tell us that a CLÁR programme that has &euro;10 million per annum to spend over 16 counties and 998 DEDs is the start of the big fight back and can make any significant difference to the issues raised in the Western Development Commission report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to ask a question about the Western Development Commission she should put it down, but as she knows, I have already instigated a major review of its rural functional area and functions. It is about time we stopped adding agency to agency. I measure the effect of CLÁR very simply &ndash; it is a leverage mechanism. The &euro;12 million spent this year has been worth at least &euro;50 million in investment in those areas because it levers out other money, for example to the group water schemes, <Col N="76" />in about a 6:1 ratio for every euro we put in, and in some cases 10:1. It is amazing that all of those outside but near the CLÁR area are writing to indicate that they want to get into it. I have parliamentary questions to that effect today. If it is such a failure I am amazed that their next-door neighbours are so anxious to be included in the CLÁR programme.</P>

Tá an scéal go huafásach. Tá an Rialtas ag caint ach níl faic ag tarlú. An inseoidh an tAire dúinn go mbeidh an scrúdú críochnaithe roimh an Nollag, go mbeidh cinneadh déanta ag an Roinn agus go rachaidh an tAire os comhair an Rialtais le pleananna gníomhachta?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom an cheist staitistiúil a fhreagairt. Nuair a bhíodh ag déanamh meas ar an nGaeltacht sna 1920í suas go dtí na 1950í, baineadh feidhm as an daonáireamh agus an cheist a bhí ann ná &ldquo;An bhfuil Gaeilge agat?&rdquo;. Ní raibh aon ceist faoi úsáid na Gaeilge. Mar sin, <Col N="77" />dá mbainfaí sin mar cheist don lá inniu, bheadh an tír iomlán ina breac-Ghaeltacht, mar deir beagáinín dhá thrian den phobal go bhfuil siad in ann Gaeilge a labhairt.

      <P>Tá mé ag caint ar cheist staitisiúil. Tá daoine ag cur an cheist &ldquo;An bhfuil Gaeilge agat?&rdquo; i gcomhthéacs na Gaeltachta i gcomparáid leis an gceist a cuireadh san daonáireamh deireanach i 1996, agus arís i 2002, &ldquo;An labhrann tú an Ghaeilge go laethúil?&rdquo; Tá líon i bhfad níos mó daoine a deir go bhfuil Gaeilge acu, fiú sa Ghaeltacht, ná mar atá a deir go labhrann siad go laethúil í. Caithfimid bheith cúramach faoin mhíchomparáid staitisticí atá ar bun. Tá speis faoi láthair agam san ábhar mar rinne mé anailís ar na figiúirí agus go deimhin féin, chaith m'athair na blianta fada ag dul tríd agus é ina shaineolaí ar an gceist seo le linn a thréimhse féin. Eisean ba mhó a rinne obair ar staid na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Dúradh liom i nGaeltacht na Rinne go dúradh i 1926 nach raibh cúig theaglach ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil. Tá i bhfad níos mó ná sin ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil inniu so ní dhrochscéal uile atá ann.</P>
      <P>Tá brú ar an nGaeltacht agus seo a dhéanfaidh mé. Nuair a fuair mé tuarascáil Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, coimisiún a dheachaigh mise chuig an Rialtas lena bhunú, fuair mé go raibh 19 molta thar a bheith ginearálta ann agus thosaigh mé ag tógail cinnithe láithreach maidir leis na moltaí ginearálta a bhí sa tuarascáil. Ní thuarascáil sonrach é má léitear í. Tá na himreoirí móra Gaeltachta tugtha timpeall ar an mbord agus caithfimid, cruinniú ar chruinniú, ábhar ar ábhar, cinnithe a dhéanamh. Beidh cuid de na cinnithe sin go mbeimid in ann a chur i bhfeidhm gan dhul ar ais chuid an Rialtas agus déanfar sin láithreach. Beidh cinnithe eile go gcaithfidh mé dhul chuig an gcoiste eadar-rannach nó comhoibriú Ranna Stáit eile a fháil ach arís ní bheidh orm dhul ar ais go dtí an Rialtas agus déanfar sin láithreach. Ansin beidh cinnithe go mbeidh airgead agus cinnithe Rialtais ag teastáil lena n-aghaidh agus tiocfaidh mé de réir mar is gá ag an Rialtas ar lorg na gcinnithe sin. In ionad fanacht leis an aon lá amháin leis an rud a chur i ngníomh tá siad á gcur ón lá seo amach.</P>
      <P>Beidh an chéad cruinniú eile den choiste ar bun ag Oireachtas na Gaeilge ag deireadh na míosa seo. Tá clár maith oibre leagtha amach don chruinniú sin agus beimid ag díriú ar sheirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil d'aois óg na Gaeltachta mar sin eochar na ceiste don todhchaí.</P>

      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the census data and consider additional areas for inclusion. I have commissioned the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis at NUI, Maynooth, to analyse the 2002 population census data to assist me in reviewing the CLÁR areas. I expect the review will be completed by the end of 2002 and the outcome will be made available publicly.</P>

      <P>As someone who originally criticised the CLÁR programme because it might mean extra bureaucracy, I am satisfied it is fulfilling its purpose, albeit to a limited extent, because there is a limited amount of money involved. However, it is important to take into account the recent census. I will limit my remarks to my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan for purely parochial and Border purposes. The census indicated that the Clones area was among those areas which lost the greatest number of its population down through the years. The Templefort and Mountainlodge areas in County Cavan and the Mullyash area north of Castleblayney have also lost dramatic numbers of their population, not just as a result of the economic situation but because of the Border troubles. Is there some technicality by which these areas, which are not included in the original CLÁR areas, can be included? It is vital that the Mullyash and Knockatallan-Bragan areas, which do not come under the current CLÁR programme, are included. Under the old scheme which dealt with severely handicapped areas, there was always the excuse that if an area was not adjacent to one of the selected areas it could not be included. It is vital that these regulations are put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable progress in this regard since the initial concept was introduced. The initial concept was based on 15 areas, with 150,000 people. However, 16 areas have been chosen, including 285,000 people.</P>
      <P>I want to discuss the issue in more detail with NUI, Maynooth, to find a more fair and transparent way of dealing with the matter. However, I must guard against extending the area so much that it would dissipate the effort in the areas that lost out. Sometimes people from populous and growing areas criticise the CLÁR programme because they think areas are getting too much. That is exactly what it is about, the more people give out the more I know we are succeeding. For the first time we are getting into small places like Aghabog and we are saying to the areas that are growing and strong that they cannot be included. This programme seeks to address the possibility of getting development and money into very small areas.</P>
      <P>I will consider the question raised by the Deputy, that is, that there are islands of serious population loss. Up to now we said that 3,000 to 4,000 people would make up an area. However, I will again consider that figure. We have found in practice that it is easier to operate the scheme where the areas span county boundaries because the rest of the structures are county based. It is easier to operate on a county basis and I will take that aspect into account when I make my decision.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister hope the new review will take place? I recognise that he is considering smaller groups of people but it is vital that those in marginal areas, such as along <Col N="80" />the Border, are taken into account. I urge him to ensure this happens.</P>

      <P>I had hoped to deal with this issue very rapidly. Once one has decided on the methodology to be used and obtained maps and census data, the matter should be dealt with fairly quickly. However, I must get all the facts as there were some changes in DEDs between the two censuses. The NUI has been very helpful throughout the process but the person we needed to assist us in the process was on leave. However, this will be progressed very rapidly and I hope within a month or two to know exactly what is being proposed. We will try to deal with the matter in an open and fair manner without creating crazy anomalies. We will try to operate a mathematically sustainable system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of background, the recently published Law Society Report on Charity Law is a welcome contribution to the process of reforming this important body of legislation and will be considered in that context. Responsibility for charity regulatory matters, including charitable fundraising, and the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests was transferred to the former Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on foot of a Government order of 27 July 2001. This decision arose from the recommendations of the White Paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector, published in September 2000, which took the view that this role would better complement the community brief of the Department. These responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in June last.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on supporting voluntary activity also set out the Government's commitment to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fundraising. The work of reviewing the legislation which is currently under way in my Department will be accompanied by broad public consultation on the appropriate regulatory framework and the nature and extent of the legislative reform required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs engaged consultants in January 2002 to undertake an examination of aspects of charity law, including a review of the literature on Irish charity law and a study of the regulatory <Col N="81" />environment in other jurisdictions. I expect the report to be finalised in the coming weeks. It is envisaged that a consultation phase involving widespread public consultation with interested parties will form part of the reform process. To assist in progressing this phase of reform a consultation document will be prepared to encourage public discussion on the nature of the legislative reform required. Proposals for legislative reform in regard to charities and charitable fundraising will be brought forward as soon as possible following completion of the consultation process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and, as this is his first time to answer questions in the House, I wish him every success in his new Office. The question as to what constitutes a registered charity is an important one and, unfortunately, there is a deficit of law in that regard at present. I am heartened to hear that the new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is taking it seriously. How does the Minister of State reconcile his statement that a consultation process is about to be embarked upon with the entry in the list of promised legislation indicating that publication of the Charities Bill is expected in 2003? Is that a realistic target in the light of what he has said with regard to consultation? Also, with regard to the statement that reformation will be along the lines of the Costello report, the Minister of State seemed to indicate that the Costello report may be amended somewhat. Accordingly, my basic question is whether the 2003 target is realistic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say at this stage is that it is a target but I accept it is a long process. The Deputy mentioned the Costello report and there was also a Burton report which highlighted the same issues, more or less. The 2003 target may well be an optimistic one. It would be pointless for the Department to rush some proposals forward without bringing everybody on board. There are many interested groups and it is also important to have a wider public involvement. There is a long tradition of Irish charities operating both at home and abroad. We do not wish to introduce an unduly bureaucratic or stifling system but, rather, to enable, develop and foster what has always been a very good sector. There are many people who will have a say in the matter. I hope we will meet the 2003 target. It may be slightly optimistic but we will certainly do our best to achieve it.</P>

      <P>I accept this is a somewhat complex area. However, the Minister of State will recall an issue which arose during the general election campaign in relation to tax free status for registered charities. That is an important issue for legitimate charities and it is important to get the legislation right. However, I would like an undertaking from the Minister of State that there will be no undue delay and that work on the Bill will be given priority.</P>

      <P>Certainly, the Deputy has my word on that. At the same time, there is now an opportunity to examine the situation in a wider context than simply the fund-raising aspect. Perhaps the fund-raising issues alone could be dealt with more quickly but I am anxious to take the opportunity to look at the introduction of proper regulation, control, inspection and accountability into the entire area. There have been huge changes in relation to fund-raising and charities in recent years. There are now highly professional fund-raisers involved and newer methods are being employed. It is our intention to examine and bring forward legislation on this whole area.</P>

      <P>One of the core policy goals of my Department is the promotion of the sustainable development of the populated offshore islands and the provision of adequate levels of services to islands. In order to achieve this goal, the Department has as one of its objectives the facilitation of an adequate all year round level of access to transport for island communities. Assistance is provided by the Department to promote the development of island infrastructure and access facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the 1970s air services to the Aran Islands have been provided by Aer Árann to ensure essential services to the island communities, taking into account their unique access problems on Ireland's periphery and the need to promote economic growth, including tourism. Following a review, which included consultation between officials of my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise, of the financial implications of ensuring continuity of these air services, it was concluded that the appropriate way to guarantee these services in the future and to comply with the relevant EU requirements was by the impos<Col N="84" />ition of a public service obligation as provided for under Council Regulation 2408/92. Government approval was subsequently received to proceed with the introduction of a PSO in respect of a daily service from Galway-Minna to the Aran Islands and this service commenced in February of this year.</P>
    <P>My Department also refunds Údarás na Gaeltachta the cost incurred in providing an emergency helicopter service to Tory Island, County Donegal. This service is provided in conjunction with the North-Western Health Board on a fortnightly basis during the winter months for the use of the island community and to enable the health board to transport medical personnel to the island. I understand that the health board also transports their personnel to the island by helicopter during the summer months.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is from time to time contacted by other island communities requesting the services of an Air Corps helicopter for emergency flights mainly during inclement weather conditions. In these cases my officials approach the Department of Defence on behalf of the islanders in an effort to organise these flights. Where possible, the Air Corps will agree to provide a service. However, on some occasions they are not in a position to do so for operational reasons.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to provide new fixed wing air services to both Inishboffin, County Galway and Tory Island, County Donegal. During my term as Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and the islands, I announced my intention to carry out a comprehensive study on the proposed development and day to day management of airstrips and associated air services on a number of offshore islands. The islands concerned were the Aran Islands and Inishboffin, County Galway, Inishturk and Clare Island, County Mayo and Tory Island, County Donegal. This study was carried out by the air transport group at Cranfield University. The recommendations, which I am now examining, were essential in order to inform my Department of how best to go about providing air services to the offshore islands.</P>
    <P>At that time I also requested Údarás na Gaeltachta, independently of the study, to proceed with the planning of airstrips on Inishboffin, Inishturk, Clare Island and Tory Island. Much progress has been made by an tÚdarás in this regard including the obtaining of planning permission for airstrips on Inishboffin and at Cleggan on the mainland to serve Inishboffin. I intend to continue with this work on developing island air services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government decided to cancel the new helicopters which were to facilitate the rescue of islanders and others who might be in danger? Will this not have a major impact on the access to air travel of people who may be badly hit by sickness, death or other emerg<Col N="85" />encies? Is the Minister satisfied, given the new cutbacks, that the proposals in the programme for Government will be delivered and when will that happen?</P>

      <P>The provision of emergency air services is a matter for the Departments of the Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources and Defence. In relation to helicopters, I was talking about the provision of relief services. The emergency services are available to everybody around the country as needed. In winter weather there can be problems on some of the islands. Tory, Clare, Inishturk and Inishboffin islands are the most likely to be affected. There might be a week when boats cannot get in and out and they run short of food. These are not emergency but humanitarian missions. In these cases the helicopters have always been made available within reason. I want to separate emergency services from these missions to provide basic necessities and get people on and off the islands. There have been situations, such as a few years ago, when people could not get back to work after Christmas because they would miss flights. They had come home to the islands for Christmas and had obligations to return. It was not an emergency situation. The helicopters brought in food, milk and necessities as well as bringing people in and out as required.</P>

We have already brought a passenger service to virtually every island around the coast of any significant population, even to those of very small populations of 15 or 20 people. We also introduced for the first time regular, subsidised passenger services in non-Gaeltacht islands and gave them parity of esteem. We also introduced a more uniform system. Prior to this only the three Aran islands had air services plus the helicopter service from Donegal. There are now proposals for fixed wing services, starting with Inishboffin for operational reasons as it is the easiest to provide for because the aeroplanes are already in Connemara. We are examining Tory and Clare islands. There will be major topographical difficulties in Inishturk because it is a very hilly island. These developments will proceed quickly. Since it is in the air, even if it is on a cable, we are trying to resolve the CPO problems in County Mayo. There is a legal issue which might involve proceedings. However, we are committed to flying them across in the cable car to Inishbiggle.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the foundations for achieving a more integrated and streamlined approach to local development initiatives were set out in the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development. Since its approval by Government work has been proceeding on its implementation, including the appointment of directors of community and enterprise, the establishment of city and county development boards and the publication of new city and county strategies for economic, social and cultural development.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the city and county development boards, all area partnership companies and community groups have been participating fully in their work. Their strategic plans must demonstrate evidence of linkage and co-ordination within the framework of city and county development boards. Funding of these groups in respect of these plans, which is administered by Area Development Management Limited, is conditional on the plans having been agreed with the director of community and enterprise of the appropriate city or county development board.</P>
      <P>Funding for these plans will run up until the mid-term review of the national development plan in 2003 and in the meantime delivery methods for social inclusion measures at local level, including the role of area based partnerships, will be examined within the context of the economic, social and cultural strategies of the city and county development boards and the work of the task force on the integration of local government and local development, on which my Department is represented. The boards are mandated to bring about a more integrated approach to the delivery of public and local development services.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to think that I engage in talking shops. Most people recognise that my record is based on much action on the ground everywhere. If the Deputy goes to Gort na Rinne they will testify to this. When I entered the Department one of the first things I decided to do was to map the area partnership areas, the CDSP areas, the leader areas, the RAPID areas, the urban areas and the areas of community which are a form of ADM. I decided to draw a map to see how they all overlap. It is time this was examined and rationalised. The Department was set up to make this more rational. After four months in the Department and much reading and studying of the issue I am still utterly confused about all the agencies and exactly what they are all doing. I do not think that too many Deputies would claim to be able to get 100% in an examination on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would certainly not get 100% on this issue. Whatever he says in fulsome praise of himself &ndash; we are all entitled to be arrogant if we want to &ndash; the reality is that he gave the same answer as was given on 7 March 2002 by the last Government. He says he is indulging in a lot of reading but it is action we need, not reading or talk. I acknowledge that money has gone into the Ring Gaeltacht &ndash; not surprising during the Celtic tiger era &ndash; but I vainly tried to enlist the Minister's aid regarding the provision of a sports hall for Mean Scoil Naomh San Nioclás in Ring, which is unique as a secondary school in a Gaeltacht. Rather than give smart answers and indulge in self-praise, will the Minister tell us what is happening? I asked a simple question which he has evaded with vainglorious nonsense. Does the Minister of State have any idea whether the directors of community and enterprise are making any difference in terms of the effectiveness of the sector on the ground?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was focused towards the directors of community and enterprise and, as the Deputy is aware, that part of the structure in the CBD is the day to day responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, not this Department. Where my Department comes in relates to the partnerships, the Leader companies, the CDSPs and so on. As well as that, we have an interesting side model in the form of the Gaeltacht co-operatives. I am looking at all these varied models working in rural areas and I am trying to extrapolate all the information as to how they work. This is no small task but I will come forward with ideas as to how to streamline the system. In rural areas, there is a question as to whether a partnership and a Leader company operating in the same area with two offices and two financial structures and so on is a good idea. Some work in dupli<Col N="88" />cate and some do not, and that is an issue we will examine quickly.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the CDSPs and the communities needs to be examined and action taken, but the Deputy will appreciate that the first thing one does in a Department is read up on what is happening. We had the intervention of a short holiday and since then I have been trying to get the information together and get these maps so I can examine this matter in a coherent way. I met ADM's board last week to discuss these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that one of the factors that is most frustrating the effect of integration of local government and development systems is the degree of distrust which exists between the elected public representatives of the local development structures who see them not as structures with which to co-operate but as structures that are in competition with them? Does he agree there is a need to put forward clear reasons as to why both exist and what they can do? Is there not a problem on the other side of the equation in terms of volunteer training and development of people who are mainly within the structures of the local development systems? A sum of £5 million was promised under the PPF for volunteer training but it has not materialised nor has the £2 million that was talked about in the White Paper on supporting volunteer activity. Will the Minister outline whether it is his intention to put in place such funding and methods to overcome the degree of distrust that exists?</P>

This is something I want to examine. There is a debate on the ground on the great differences between rural and urban Ireland. From the experience of my volunteer years, we did not think we needed eternal training, rather we wanted resources on the ground to deliver to our people. We believed that we had within ourselves as much knowledge as anyone who could give us training. It is a view I must take on board because that is what the people of rural Ireland are telling me.</P>

      <P>That concludes questions for today. I now come to deal with Private Notice Questions to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on abuse allegations. Before I call on Members, I remind the House that under the <i>sub judice</i> rule, there is an onus on Members to avoid comment which might prejudice the outcome of any proceedings which would arise following investigations. I now call on the Deputies who tabled questions to the Minister in the order in which they submitted their questions to my office. I call Deputy Pat Rabbitte to put his question to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the huge public concern arising from the disclosures on the RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on clerical child sex abuse in the Dublin archdiocese and the decision of the Government, announced yesterday, of the establishment of a non-statutory inquiry into similar allegations in the Ferns diocese, will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform say what proposals he has for an inquiry into widespread allegations of abuse highlighted in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, if a Garda investigation is under way; and if he will make a statement on the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Rabbitte and Deasy for tabling these Private Notice Questions. I accept the statement that there is widespread public concern about this matter. I do not believe any right-minded person could watch the programme without a sense of shock, anger and revulsion, even more so because it raised issues which we, as a society, have to find an effective means to address. The issues involved will not go away and have to be faced up to by everyone fairly and squarely whatever the difficulties and wherever they lead.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has announced the establishment of a non-statutory investigation into allegations in relation to the Ferns diocese. The Government was aware of the progress that had been made by George Birmingham SC in this matter and felt it would be unfair to the victims involved to delay making further progress on the cases in Ferns while we were considering what further action might be necessary in relation to other allegations of sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know all members of the House will want to avoid knee-jerk reactions and will be prepared to <Col N="90" />give the Government the time that is necessary to reflect on the highly complex issues which arise. This is not a recipe for inaction, but marks a determination on our part that whatever might be done will be effective in addressing the issues which arise. We all agree that this is the least we owe to some of the most vulnerable members of our community who suffered, often in silence and desperation, while terrible wrongs were done to them.</P>
    <P>I will return to this issue but I want to outline to the House first the steps that are being taken immediately by the Garda Síochána to deal with some of the issues which arise. Following the television programme I had urgent consultations with the Garda authorities. It is important to emphasise initially that sexual abuse complaints will be fully investigated by An Garda Síochána and that no resources will be spared in bringing perpetrators to justice. It is the case that many clerical perpetrators of sexual abuse have been convicted following numerous and extensive Garda investigations and many of them are in custody at present.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of any other form of inquiry that might be undertaken it must be a priority that every effort is made to ensure that anyone who has engaged in criminal behaviour in this matter, or in a matter of this kind, is brought to justice. Following consultation with the Garda authorities I can inform the House that a chief superintendent is being assigned, with additional gardaí, as part of the domestic violence and sexual assault unit to carry out an analytical overview of the type of cases in question, to review particular cases with a view to seeing whether further lines of inquiry might be available which could lead to preferring criminal charges, to pursue any additional evidence which becomes available and to investigate fully fresh complaints which may be brought in this area.</P>
    <P>I know all Members of the House will join with me in appealing to anyone who has information which would enable such cases to be pursued to come forward. To facilitate this the Garda will announce today details of a special telephone line which is being set up for the chief superintendent and his unit. I assure the House that the Garda Síochána fully recognises the terrible wrongs done to victims of sexual abuse and it deals with these cases with utmost sensitivity and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised in relation to the adequacy of the criminal law in pursuing those who failed to report details of sexual abuse. I have obtained a preliminary survey of the existing law from the Office of the Attorney General and am currently examining it. This is an extremely complex question and I will seek further advice on the matter. As part of any criminal proceedings the application of the law has to be considered in the light of the details of the particular case and I assure the House that in pursuing cases the Garda, in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, will consider all legal options <Col N="91" />available. I neither want to understate nor overstate the difficulties involved in that regard but it has to be borne in mind that one of the primary functions of the new deployment of Garda resources will be to pursue actual abusers where evidence can be obtained against them.</P>
    <P>While the criminal law has a primary role to play in addressing what in many cases was clearly criminal behaviour of an egregious kind I accept that other issues arise which may be beyond the scope of the criminal law. It will be clear from what I have said that I am not yet in a position to announce specific proposals in this regard although the Government has given some preliminary consideration to this matter. In particular, I assure the House that the Government fully accepts that we have to tackle the question of finding some mechanism that can address effectively issues which rightly are the cause of grave concern. These include what form an inquiry might take, what precisely it is to inquire into and what powers it should have. More importantly perhaps, we should be careful not to do anything which would in any way diminish the chances of criminal prosecutions being brought successfully where they are warranted.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme highlighted something very rotten at the heart of our society and it cannot be ignored. The Government is determined to face up to its responsibilities in this matter. I know all Members will support it in doing so and I, of course, will fully consider any suggestions which Deputies Rabbitte or Deasy, or any other Member, have to make in a constructive approach to the resolution of these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and acknowledge that it may be necessary to make haste slowly as these are complex issues. However, I am bound to put it to him that when he says the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme highlighted something very rotten at the heart of our society that the State did not have to wait for that programme to know about some of these terrible events. In terms of making those in positions of authority in the church, especially in the Archdiocese of Dublin, accountable and amenable there is nothing in the Minister's answer that holds out hope for either the victims concerned or to assuage public opinion. Is it the case that Garda action is being taken and prosecutions being initiated in respect of the perpetrators, the &ldquo;actual abusers&rdquo;, but that in regard to those in positions of authority who colluded and concealed the evil that was going on, information in respect of which was in their possession, neither he nor the Government is in a position to say how best they ought to be made amenable to the law of the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter one has to proceed carefully. We are talking, in the context of one archdiocese, about a small group of people who are in authority. I do not want to say any<Col N="92" />thing which amounts to an assault on them or is a pre-judgment of their liability in civil or criminal law. The Deputy has the liberty of asking searching questions but I have to be circumspect with the answers I give him.</P>
      <P>The Government does not direct the processes of criminal justice in this country. We have the Garda Síochána, which in partnership with the Director of Public Prosecutions, conducts the inquiry into suspected criminal offences and makes its decisions independently of the Minister. I wish to correct any wrong impression in the House that I purport to direct a prosecution or criminal investigation. That is not how our system works and we would be the poorer as a country if it was.</P>
      <P>I use the phrase &ldquo;sins of omission&rdquo; to cover those who may or may not have been in possession of information which they, for one reason or another, did not bring to the attention of An Garda Síochána. The Deputy will appreciate that there are two broad issues here. Firstly, there is the question of whether omissions amount in any individual case to a contravention of our criminal law. That is a matter on which I will offer no opinion at this stage because it is complex as anyone who has been listening to our airwaves or reading our newspapers will appreciate. The second issue relates to the civil law in regard to the duty owed by one person to another and whether such activity could render anybody liable to being pursued for civil remedies. Again it is a complicated separate issue.</P>
      <P>There is another area of law, so to speak, namely public law as more widely interpreted. That concerns the obligations of institutions in the State to protect people in their charge, or with whom they have contact, from egregious sexual violation of the kind that this programme portrayed. Any institution, of any kind or any religious denomination, however organised, which claims the right to provide services to engage in education or pastoral work, in circumstances where its members are likely to come into contact with young people clearly owes those young people, quite apart from criminal or civil liability issues, a fundamental duty under our Constitution to save them from violation and degradation of the kind we saw. That duty and the question as to whether it was complied with are the issue now. If we are of the <i>prima facie</i> view that it was not complied with, what we do about it, how we establish the facts, how we assign accountability and how we learn lessons and ensure these kind of things do not happen again are at issue. I presume that is the area that would be the proper subject matter of an inquiry. Deputies should understand as well that, once we go the road of a statutory inquiry, either under existing or new machinery, and with compelled testimony, it compromises the capacity subsequently to use the compelled testimony to prosecute the people involved. Choices must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the House to understand, therefore, that these are fundamental issues because the matter <Col N="93" />is one of fundamental importance. I do not want to be rushed into either knee-jerk reactions or making superficial judgments on the issues. I and my colleagues in Government must look around a number of corners to see where a course adopted by the Government would bring us. I appeal to Members to understand that there are occasions when one cannot outline a course of action which is blindingly obvious and failure to take which would be inexplicable. On this occasion, a number of options are open to me and I intend to examine them carefully.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I met some of the people who have acted as spokespersons for victims of this type of abuse and they had a full, frank and friendly interview with me. They have also supported my position which is that I want to proceed carefully to ensure whatever I do is effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response. If one had read the newspapers, one might have been excused for assuming that all child sex abuse was perpetrated by priests. We know it is not and that a small number of sex abuse cases are attributed to clerics. The figures I have seen from the Department of Health and Children indicate that there was one such case in more than 2,000 child sex abuse cases. The size and scale of this is massive and is not solely related to clerical sex abuse.</P>
      <P>How will the Government combat that and what will it do about it? We had a debate last week about the re-offending rate of sex offenders and the level of therapeutic treatment they receive in prison. The Minister was forthcoming and forthright about that when he acknowledged that not enough was being done. What plans does the Government have to combat child sex abuse in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is widening the issue from that in the special notice question but I appreciate that he is making a valuable point which is one that cuts both ways. Sexual abuse of children is by no means a phenomenon confined to any single denomination, member of clergy or religious organisation. As the Deputy fairly points out, the great majority of sexual abuse of children is not perpetrated by people who fall into the classic definition of a paedophile and is certainly not carried out by people in religious orders. From that perspective the Deputy makes a good point, that we must not view our social policy as one which places one denomination or its members in the dock, so to speak, and which labels them accused in some social theatre when the problem is more widespread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty posed by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme is that the organisation in question purported to have a system of internal justice set out in canon law and safeguards set out for the parents and children who were the victims of the heinous acts. The question is whether that system was effective or whether it compounded the wrong rather than dealing with it and preventing <Col N="94" />it. That is the issue I see arising from the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. That is an issue which, of itself, merits inquiry.</P>
    <P>Although the Deputy is correct to say that there are many other victims of abuse and surveys show a staggering total of our children have been subject to some form of abuse at some stage in their lives, nonetheless I am being asked by these two private notice questions to address the specific issues which arise in this context and to say what steps I propose to take. I appeal to the House to give me time to reflect on it. It would be easy to devise some knee-jerk solution, but as the House knows well, this matter is so serious that it merits some time before being acted upon.</P>
    <P>For example, a decision was made to go the non-statutory route in the Ferns inquiry. That decision has the support of the spokespeople for the victims of that abuse. It might well be that, if someone on the first day had suggested taking that route, the immediate point would have been made that it was likely to run into obstruction and to be confounded by an unwilling diocesan clergy. The Government took the prudent course of asking senior counsel, George Birmingham, to survey the territory and determine the most appropriate means of going forward. In doing so, the Government brought the victims of the abuse in that diocese along with its subsequent decision to proceed on a non-statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Whether an inquiry on such a basis would be adequate to deal with the issues in the Dublin archdiocese is a matter on which I have still not made up my mind and will not until such time as I have taken steps to examine fairly and even-handedly what is likely to happen. Issues such as the degree of anticipated co-operation, the extent of the issue in question and the likelihood of it becoming embroiled in court procedure and objections must be taken into account by me, as is the issue of whether, if I go down the route of a statutory inquiry, I will prejudice criminal prosecutions which may or may not be sustainable in the light of what may become available to An Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The issue is difficult and is not one on which I can offer Deputies some pat solution. I appreciate that, yesterday, the day before and today, Members were and are supportive of my position and that of the Taoiseach that this is an issue on which we need time to reflect so that we do not do something just for the appearance of doing something and that we do what is demanded by the situation, namely to take action which will be effective in the long-term rather than in the short-term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that this private notice question is being allowed today, having been disallowed yesterday. My colleague, Deputy Cuffe, tabled a similar question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is full knowledge that what needs to be done must be done with care and caution, part of the public concern about the Government's response is that there appears to be <Col N="95" />respect for the institution concerned which should not exist in the context of the vastness of the alleged crimes. In public discussion to date there appears to be an acceptance that canon law is equivalent to State law, even to the extent that the welcome inquiry announced by the Minister for Health and Children into the Ferns diocese recognises a church administrative area. It should be made clear that whatever investigations take place will be on the basis of how the existing laws of the State are created and enforced. If we are discussing tackling problems relating to the State, we must be careful not to do so with excessive caution and respect. Not only should the announced inquiry be conducted into a proper geographical and accepted political entity, we should also put the lie to the fact that whatever status canon law has within the institution concerned, it has no status with an investigation the State might decide to carry out in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Deputy. Yesterday I was in Hillsborough on official business and I would have been unable to take this question had it been tabled and allowed. Nobody has suggested equivalence between canon law and the law of the State. The Taoiseach has repeatedly stated, including in the Deputy's presence in this House, that there is only one law in this State and that is the law to which we are all subject. This morning on the airwaves I repeated that point and elaborated on it. There is no question of confusion on this side of the House that there is any equivalence between the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church or the law of any denomination or private organisation in education or elsewhere and the law of our State. No contrary impression has been given by anybody associated with Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy stated that by announcing an inquiry in relation to the diocese of Ferns, the Government was adopting a geographical size to its inquiry, which somehow slavishly followed the contours of church dioceses. That is not right at all. In that case we are dealing with an issue which arises from the organic structure of authority in relation to the activities of one particular diocese. It is nothing to do with taking the boundaries from the Catholic Church. It is precisely because that diocese was the subject of the inquiry that it is confined to that diocese.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Deputy's question, I detect the innuendo &ndash; maybe it is unjustified &ndash; that somehow I am being unduly accommodating to the Roman Catholic Church in the caution I am taking. I am not afraid of the bang of a crosier from any direction. I am acting in the prudent interests of the State and, most of all, of the victims. I will not be embarrassed or in any way found to be wanting. I will follow this where it goes, regardless of how high or low it goes. The Deputy should not attempt to imply in any way that the cautious and careful approach I am adopting is in some sense a subservient approach because we are dealing <Col N="96" />with the Church, which is the largest in the country. On the contrary, that is not affecting my view.</P>

      <P>I say again to the Minister that the only concern on this side of the House is that the people involved are made amenable to the law of the land. There is no wish to embarrass the Government into taking speedier action than it might otherwise take. However, is it not the case that the Government ought not have been taken by surprise by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme? The issues that programme put, in a powerful way, in the public domain were in the main already known to the Government and it appears the previous Government was somewhat lax in pursuing some of the issues to their logical conclusion.</P>
      <P>Can we take it that it has been resolved by Government that there will be an inquiry and that the only issue that arises is the form and character of that inquiry? Can we take it that the issue that determined a non-statutory inquiry in the case of Ferns was that the necessary co-operation is seen to be forthcoming? If co-operation is the issue, will the Minister say whether discussions are under way, or have discussions taken place with Cardinal Connell about him and his office co-operating in a similar fashion to that demonstrated by Bishop Eamonn Walsh in Ferns?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think there may be merit in following the model of the Kilkenny incest inquiry? Is the Minister as conscious as Deputies on this side of the House of the need to assure the public that the heinous acts to which he referred are not still continuing within some of the institutions of the Catholic Church on this island? Are there steps that can be taken to try to ensure that is not happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an elaborate and fairly modern law in relation to the protection of children from sexual assault and sexual violation. We have elaborated considerable change in the way the law works in such cases. The Deputy asked me for an assurance that it is not happening now, but I cannot give him that assurance. I cannot give him the assurance that sexual abuse is not taking place either within or without any particular Church or, as Deputy Deasy implied, in any other part of society. That is not an assurance I could give this House and if I gave it, it would be worthless because it would be a statement of hope rather than of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Kilkenny incest inquiry conducted by Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness was effective because most of the agencies, whose activities were under investigation, in that context were State agencies which could be directed to co-<Col N="97" />operate. Naturally in the case of non-State organisations different considerations apply. The Deputy asks the fair question whether the Government has in effect decided to hold some form of inquiry but has not yet decided the form or ambit of that inquiry. The Government considered this matter at its last Cabinet meeting and decided it must carefully assess what steps are open to it now. There are a number of possibilities. There is the Kilkenny model, mentioned by the Deputy. There is the Ferns model, which involves an initial survey by an independent person of eminence, followed by a non-statutory inquiry. In that context, I stress that it was not simply the co-operation issue, although that was one of the issues that weighed heavily, it was also the advice given to my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, by Mr. Birmingham about the attitude of the victims which was of some significance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Dublin archdiocese, the Deputy asked whether I had spoken to the Cardinal or anybody else in the archdiocese yet to ascertain their willingness to co-operate. The answer is that I have not, but I assure the Deputy that before a final decision is made in this matter as to what course will be adopted, the Government will have to come to an assessment of the degree of likely co-operation. My door is open to anybody who wants to offer co-operation on an open-handed basis. I will go to anybody whom I believe I should consult to see if co-operation will be forthcoming. I have been in consultation with the Garda on a number of occasions, as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>I have been examining the adequacy of the existing criminal law. I have been looking at the legal options open to me in terms of inquiries &ndash; statutory, non-statutory, private and so on &ndash; as well as the possibility in the wake of the Abbeylara decision that the House may have to establish a new type of inquiry which is not an adversarial tribunal but a private inquiry backed up by statutory powers. Those are the options I am examining and I assure the House I am taking the time to do so.</P>

      <P>Rape Crisis Network Ireland issued an interesting press release yesterday which stated that it was not surprised to hear about clerical sex abuse or the findings of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. That is not surprising when one considers the last report on sexual abuse in the country, which showed that 42% of women in the country had been abused at some point in their lives and 28% of men had been abused. Are we going to wait for another &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme to do something about this? One of the biggest issues in sexual abuse is that people do not report the crimes as the onus is switched from the alleged perpetrator to the victim. We will have to deal with this if we are to deal with sexual abuse in its totality. I understand the Minister cannot give us assurances that this is not occurring within the Catholic Church and other places but can he tell us the Government's position on tackling child sexual abuse? Does the Government have a policy on tackling child sexual abuse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deasy echoes a point made by Deputy Rabbitte, which is the issue of whether I or the Government were surprised by this and that this was obvious in some way. Obviously the facts of sexual abuse have been unfolding before our eyes for a number of years and successive Governments, not just those involving the present parties in Government, have seen these revelations about the extent of sexual abuse in our society. I appreciate that point and I am shocked by the depravity of the crime and the suffering of those involved, but I am not shocked to find that there has been abuse of children by members of the clergy because, as Deputy Deasy pointed out, survey after survey has shown that sexual abuse of children in our society and similar societies is much more widespread than is generally felt. I hope the Deputy does not think I am dismissive when I say I am not here simply to announce some broad new Government initiative on sexual abuse.</P>

There are laws which must be upheld and the Government improves those laws constantly. I ask the Deputy not to suggest that in some sense these events are the fault of the Government. They are not. They may represent something in which society in general and successive Governments have been found wanting but to polarise this by the Deputy somehow asking me to come up with a policy initiative which will put paid to sexual abuse in our society is to reduce this matter to a political Punch and Judy show, which is not what I intend to do. I intend to do my duty and to take the time <Col N="99" />to do so carefully. I do not intend to be distracted by questions as to what my policy is on matters such as sexual abuse.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998, in the immediate wake of the Omagh bomb, an Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act was passed. This was prior to my becoming Attorney General. In the course of passing that legislation, the offence of failing to report serious offences was created. &ldquo;Serious offences&rdquo; were defined as offences attracting a penalty of more than five years but it is notable that at that time, to avoid the whole area of mandatory reporting of sexual abuse, the category of sexual crime was expressly deleted from the category of crimes which were to be reported. That is what I have been studying for the past few days &ndash; the fact that in 1998 we passed a law which made it an offence to fail to report any serious offence with the sole exception of sexual offences. Neither I nor the Deputy was here at the time and I can see the reason it was done. It was probably thought that rather than face a constitutional challenge in the area of mandatory reporting, it was more important to confront the post-Omagh situation on narrower ground. This issue has not gone away and must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the parameters of criminal law outlined by the Minister, particularly with regard to the Criminal Law Act, 1997, which abolished the distinction between common law felonies and misdemeanours. Is the Minister satisfied that the abolition of misprision of felony, which appeared to be gathered into the legislation, was on a retrospective basis? Is part of his review establishing whether that was retrospective rather than prospective? Was that offence abolished hook, line and sinker as of the date the legislation passed or was it still extant at that date and operating retrospectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" />In 1995 there was an updated canon law review, which the Minister has studied. It mentions a five year statute of limitations. Is the Minister satisfied that the statute of limitations for some of the laws dealing with sexual abuse passed here &ndash; which are part of secular, civil law &ndash; override any edicts in canon law? Is that part of the Minister's review?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first question is about the effect on the pre-existing common law offence of misprision of felony of the passing of the 1997 Act. The situation appears to be that no express repeal of that common law offence was carried out. Whether by abolishing felonies as a category one effectively repealed that common law offence is something on which there are two opinions. If it were by implication repealed by the 1997 Act, whether that was retrospective so as to prevent prosecutions now arising on pre-1997 evidence, that again is an issue on which there are two points of view. When the offence of assault was merged into the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, the previous common law offence of assault was abolished.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will know that there were a number of cases, including a case in which the plaintiff was a Mr. Grealish, which went through the courts to the Supreme Court. In the course of that, the meaning of the Interpretation Act arose. The Interpretation Act, for the benefit of Deputies who have not studied this closely &ndash; I do not expect most will have &ndash; provides that where a statute repeals a statutory criminal offence, unless the repealing statute provides otherwise, it is still possible to prosecute, after the repeal, offences under the repealed statute, during the time when it was in effect. That is not necessarily the case in respect of common law offences. The Interpretation Act is silent on that. I note that one of the judgments in the Supreme Court in, I think, the Grealish case, commented that it was a matter for another day. Yet again, that is an issue of uncertainty.</P>
      <P>I am not, and do not hold myself out to be, an expert on canon law. I am advised that it is obvious because the five year limitation period under canon law that was referred to has been amended by some subsequent amendment of the canon law to ten years, so I am told. I accept correction on the intricacies of canon law from any source because I do not offer myself as an expert in it and I never have. Time periods provided by the rules of any organisation, be it a Church or a voluntary organisation, are merely binding on that organisation and not on the greater world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the civil law of the State, the Statute of Limitations has been amended so as to extend liability beyond the ordinary statutory period for the commencement of civil actions in cases where the mind of the victim was overborne, so to speak, and the victim was by virtue of the nature of the crime or the behaviour of the perpetrator, rendered incapable of bringing an <Col N="101" />action during the statute period. That is a question which is quite removed from canon law. I would not offer an opinion on canon law save to say again, in case I am accused of equating it with the civil law of the State, that the provisions of canon law are a matter of interest to the Church which operates it, they are not cognisable in our ordinary courts of law and they are not to be equated with the law of this republic.</P>

      <P>While recognising the need to proceed with caution in matters of this nature, perhaps it is also recognised that there is now a need to proceed. Given that matters of this nature have been in the public arena for ten years or so, will the Minister indicate to the House why it should have fallen to the current affairs programme, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, to raise this issue in the way it was done? Was information available to his Department prior to the programme which was substantiated subsequently in the programme? Had the Minister information available to him prior to the broadcasting of the programme which the programme subsequently underlined and confirmed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the broadcast of that programme. I do not feel any resentment that these matters have emerged. I regard it as a great tribute to RTE and the quality of its broadcasting and its current affairs section that it was able to put together such a compelling account of these events in a manner which attracted the public's attention and has evoked such a reaction.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that we are not in an era of trial by television and that due process is slightly more exacting than that. I commend the makers of that programme for the industry and the professionalism they exhibited. They put a challenge to us all of very substantial proportions. I regard that programme as a challenge, not a challenge that I resent in any way but a challenge.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asks if anything had happened in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform before this programme was aired to alert us to the matter and if it had been ignored. The answer is that I do not mind him trawling in the chance that there is some information in my Department which I have been concealing. As far as I know, there is not. The programme is not based on material which was reasonably available to my Department. I remind the Deputy that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not privy to most investigatory files and is never made privy to them. Most of these are entirely confidential and will never come into the public domain. Most victims of sexual crime are accorded total privacy if they want it. The circumstances in which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would become aware of any individual sexual offence are few and far between. There is nothing now in my Department to warrant a different approach which was not there when the Deputy's party held that portfolio.</P>

One priest named in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme admitted that he had abused up to 100 children, yet the programme only told of one of those children. When the Minister is deciding on what course of action to take, will he take into consideration that if 2% of people are abused, then there must be at least 10% to 20% of people who know about it? Will the Minister take into consideration mechanisms to allow people who know about these matters to come forward and give evidence to the adjudicators? I am talking about whistleblowers. By any reasonable reckoning, if 2% were abused, 20% must have known about it. Will the Minister take that into account?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his reply the Minister outlined that he is appointing a chief superintendent to the domestic violence and sexual assault unit of the Garda Síochána. One of the duties of the officer will be to review particular cases with a view to seeing whether further lines of inquiry might be available which could lead to the preferring of criminal charges. Is this an indication that there may be lines of inquiry available? Is he concerned that some of these cases may have been investigated to a certain extent and then stonewalled and the files put on the shelf? Would he agree to extending the chief superintendent's remit that if he encounters cases where further lines of inquiry may lead to the preferring of criminal charges, he would examine why these lines of inquiry were not followed up in the first instance?</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's view with respect to not having a knee-jerk reaction. As there has been a reluctance to release files, it would appear that there was a scheme of non co-operation. Has the Minister concerns about the integrity of the files which exist in respect of these cases, whether in the possession of the Garda or the Catholic Church? I appreciate the Minister outlined that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not have access to these files but he has had discussions with the Garda authorities. If files exist and if further examinations take place which lead to prosecutions, will he examine why that was not done in the first instance? Is he concerned that some of these files, which may not have been properly documented, may disappear?</P>

Will the Government take a clear decision on mandatory reporting as part of this process? The Minister said there is a constitutional obligation on institutions to protect children in their charge yet, as we saw in &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; and again in this case, institutions are systematically failing to honour that constitutional obligation. Has the Minister initiatives which will create some momentum for this constitutional obligation to be honoured and <Col N="103" />a system which will enforce it if necessary? Is he satisfied that is adequately done?</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly raised the concern that if one has compelled testimony, one compromises the capacity to use it in subsequent criminal investigations and yet he said a criminal investigation is being carried out by the Garda. Is he suggesting that if he triggers some form of inquiry, all criminal pursuit is, in some way, halted at that stage or can the two processes continue in parallel, that is, the pursuit by the Garda of criminal prosecutions and the inquiry which the Minister has under serious and active consideration at this stage?</P>

      <P>Reinstatement would be appropriate if there was egregious behaviour by an employer in circumstances such as those. The State, as an employer, would not penalise or adversely affect a public servant for doing their duty. I assure all public servants that is the case and I hope that message is widely understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Timmins raised the important question of whether there is information in files or other places which might be of use in reviving prosecutions which fell by the wayside due to lack of evidence, age, lack of corroboration or whatever. There have been cases of which we are all aware where prosecutions were not brought forward because of the inadequacy of the complainant's evidence, the passage of time and the absence of supporting evidence. If, in those cases, evidence of a confession or an acknowledgement of the crime by the alleged perpetrator had been available, that would have tipped the scales decisively in favour of prosecution and perhaps a conviction at a later stage if that evidence stood up. There is a serious issue here for those who are in possession of information which they know would tip the scales in terms of effective prosecution of people who have perpetrated sexual crimes. If they have that information within their power of procurement, the <Col N="104" />question arises as to whether it is conscionable for them to withhold it and to deny the criminal law of this State that evidence on some ground or other. It is evident that there are some people in our society who are entitled to invoke some form of privilege, such as lawyers and spouses.</P>
    <P>Whether it is conscionable for people on an organised basis to offer themselves to the people as an organisation or a Church which may run schools and hospitals and put priests into contact with young people while saying that whenever they are in the possession of information which could lead to a criminal prosecution they can, in good conscience, keep it<i> in pectore,</i> so to speak, and allow the criminal law to be confounded, raises a deep question of ethics. While I am not here to preach to anybody, many people find it difficult to understand how an ethically driven body could withhold information, leading to many perpetrators not merely not being prosecuted but going free to commit the same crimes again.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Richard Bruton's point, our laws are divided into criminal law and civil law. We provide criminal penalties for some activities and civil remedies for others. There is a third branch of the law where the State intervenes as regulator, licensor or guarantor of quality. It is in relation to those three areas of potential law that the question arises as to whether we are doing enough to vindicate the right of children not to be sexually violated. We must balance our laws; we cannot rush in one direction while forgetting about due process, practicality or principles of criminal or civil justice.</P>
    <P>I take the point in relation to mandatory reporting. The White Paper, which was in the course of preparation and the subject of reference in this House in the near future, was designed to put before the people the serious and difficult choices which must be made in this context. It is not a matter of the Government shirking its responsibility. The issue is complex. Whether anybody should be in a position to report to a social worker their suspicions on the basis that the matter will not go to the Garda Síochána immediately is open to two quite different judgments. The Association of Social Workers, the representative body of social workers, takes a view not shared by some editorial writers on this subject. It does not favour a blanket and un-nuanced mandatory reporting law. It will not be for me, as Minister, to deal with but it will be for me and all Members to consider when the White Paper is published. It is not an easy question and it will require careful consideration before the right solution is found. I regret that electoral matters have held back the publication of the White Paper from the time it was last the subject of imminent publication. Maybe it is the case that the passage of time will improve it, although I do not know. I agree with the Deputy that we cannot ignore the issue any longer. In view of the uncertainties in the criminal law to which I have <Col N="105" />referred at some length, this is a subject we must address sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>Does this not give an added urgency to the Garda investigation he announced this evening into the individual cases? Undoubtedly there are many documents in the hands of the Church relating to at least some of those cases which would be extremely helpful to the Garda in their investigations. The Minister has said that the diocese of Ferns is co-operating fully with the State, but there is as yet no guarantee that other diocese are of the same mind, and while documents may be in existence today they may not be in the future.

      <P>The strongest motivating force in getting people to come forward and talk about their experiences has been their desire to ensure that no child ever again has to suffer child abuse. While I appreciate the Minister's response to Deputy Rabbitte in that regard and people's right to due process, has the Minister a role in engaging with Church and Garda to ensure that information is shared and that every effort is made to prevent people against whom accusations have been made from being in a position where they might have an opportunity to abuse children?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is wise to deal with matters slowly to get them right because we are dealing with complex issues, many of which are historical. I have a number of questions for the Minister. Was he surprised at the revelations on the RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme? I contend that in the past, not everything possible would have been done by the State, particularly through the Department of Education inspectorate, in relation to issues of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that we need to examine all of the various steps that have been taken and at all of the various Departments that deal with children, including the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to see if we can tighten up on the level of inspection in matters? The Minister noted that it is important to emphasise that sexual abuse complaints would be fully investigated by the Garda Síochána. Many of the <Col N="106" />victims of child sexual abuse will not make complaints formally to the Garda, but there is a system in place now for registering complaints through the Laffoy commission, where many submissions are being made. There is an ambiguity about whether the Garda has access to that information, which is being given to the Laffoy commission by many people. Does the Minister agree the Garda should have access to that information and that the information being submitted to Ms Justice Laffoy should be treated formally as a complaint by the victim and therefore subject to Garda investigation? Otherwise we are going to have a long drawn-out process through the Laffoy Commission and will not get to the root of many of the difficulties of this very serious and complex matter for many years to come.</P>

Regarding the question of preserving documents, it has been suggested here that documents may be shredded. I hope Deputies will appreciate that I am not in a position to direct or encourage the Garda to swoop on any repository of documents and to preserve them. If the Garda Síochána seek judicial authority for an evidence-gathering exercise within its remit, that is a matter for it, and it would be very strange if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was seen to be directing matters from the outside or advising it on what it should or should not do.

      <P>Deputy Hogan asked whether I was surprised by the content of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. At one level I was shocked and angered, but I was not surprised because having spent many years as a practitioner in criminal law, I have always suspected that things of this nature were happening. I have always been of the view that what we see in the criminal courts is by necessity only a small fraction of crime of any kind.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me in particular about the Department of Education and Science's inspectors and so on, and whether I was concerned on that front. When I was an Opposition Deputy, I was approached by an individual public servant, who I think has approached the Deputy more recently, with concerns about this matter. I took a lot of time attempting to bring about action on foot of her concerns. It is a worry to me that there have been occasions on which people who have attempted to be whistle-blowers have run into heavy weather.</P>

I do not know the answer to this, but I will undertake to write to the Deputy and inform him in due course.</P>

    <P>&ndash;accepts in full the findings in the report;</P>
    <P>&ndash;acknowledges the extraordinary suffering endured by those persons with haemophilia who were infected, and by their families, and acknowledges the harrowing personal testimonies given to the tribunal of inquiry by some of those who have suffered;</P>
    <P>&ndash;notes and acknowledges the widespread sense of public dismay at the matters disclosed in the report;</P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the Government decision to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions; </P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the Government's commitment to implement the recommendations in the report, and specifically to appoint a national haemophilia co-ordinating committee, and appropriate subcommittees, on a statutory basis;</P>
    <P>&ndash;acknowledges the high standard of care currently being provided to persons with haemophilia and supports the Government's undertaking to work in partnership with the Irish Haemophilia Society and treating clinicians to ensure that the highest standards of health care continue to be made available;</P>
    <P>&ndash;supports the Government's commitment to ensuring the availability of an adequate and ongoing supply of clotting factor concentrates that meet the highest national and international standards of safety and efficacy.</P>
    <P>While many matters of grave national importance have been discussed in this House, seldom has a report been considered which is literally about matters of life and death. The report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia has its origins in circumstances which resulted in much grief and suffering. The premature loss of fathers, husbands, brothers and sons is a tragedy of immense proportions. That it should happen to a relatively small group of our citizens, namely those who are infected with haemophilia, is all the more poignant. Because of their condition, this group deserved the best that the health services had to offer. Instead, they were afflicted with an extraordinary degree of suffering.</P>
    <P>The public hearings of the tribunal commenced in May 2000 with personal testimony from a number of persons with haemophilia and from members of their families. There were two further sections of such testimony in November 2000 and October 2001. In all, 64 persons gave personal testimony.</P>
    <P>The tribunal acknowledged the debt of gratitude owed to each of the witnesses who gave personal testimony, some of whom were very ill at the time, and also acknowledged their courage in coming forward to do so. We all owe a debt of <Col N="110" />gratitude to those who gave testimony and who spoke out despite their own suffering, in the hope that others need not suffer in the same way in the future. While considering the bigger picture affecting the haemophilia community as a whole, I am also aware of the need to balance this with the individual view. The story of each individual person and his or her family is important and valuable, and must be listened to.</P>
    <P>The personal testimonies related to the tribunal highlight one of the many remarkable traits of persons with haemophilia, which is their support for each other even in the midst of their own illness, and the courage and dignity with which they have faced their condition. The tragedy is that this solidarity and support has come about because of such devastating circumstances. We owe it to those who have suffered, and continue to suffer, to learn from the mistakes of the past, and ensure that such a tragedy will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Bill earlier this year, I put on the record of this House the statement of regret which was made on my behalf at the Lindsay tribunal. I make no apologies for repeating again today that I and my Department very much regret the pain and suffering caused to all of those who have been infected by blood and blood products. The impact of this tragedy on the haemophilia community has been particularly devastating. The toll in human lives has been great and the loss of so many children is catastrophic. That such an immense tragedy should befall citizens of this State whilst availing themselves of State health services is a matter of profound regret. I wish to apologise again on behalf of the State to say how deeply sorry the State is that the haemophilia community should have been caused so much suffering.</P>
    <P>Although this is a long and detailed report, I assure Members that I and my Department have studied the report in depth. The Government has decided to accept the findings of the report in full. Having considered the report carefully, the Government has decided to refer it to the Director of Public Prosecutions, as a mark of the seriousness with which it views the events and issues which are documented in the report.</P>
    <P>The report acknowledges that much has been done in recent years to improve services for persons with haemophilia. The National Haemophilia Treatment Centre at St. James's Hospital has evolved into the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders and occupies new premises at St. James's Hospital. The report notes that the national centre is now a state of the art facility fully equipped for the diagnosis and management of haemophilia and related disorders, staffed by a highly skilled and coherent team of professionals and administrative staff committed to excellence in the delivery of haemophilia care.</P>
    <P>Members will recall from the personal testimony given to the tribunal that the lack of support services in the past, particularly counselling <Col N="111" />services, caused very real hardship and suffering. These areas have since been addressed, and the centre now provides a range of specialist services for haemophilia and related disorders. Services now include: genetic counselling and testing; dental surgery; orthopaedic surgery and care of patients with HIV and hepatitis C. A full time psychologist post has been approved as well as a full time clinical specialist for physiotherapy. A social worker is also in place.</P>
    <P>The centre provides a single tiered system, with a walk-in service 24 hours a day seven days a week for patients with haemophilia and related disorders. There is also a same day or next working day service for semi-urgent new referrals. The average waiting time to seeing patients is three months for routine referrals, and likely to decrease with the addition of the recently appointed consultant.</P>
    <P>The service is consultant-led, and in-patients are seen on a daily basis including Saturday, Sunday and holidays. All out-patients are seen by a consultant at every visit. Walk-in patients are seen by nurses and if necessary are reviewed by non-consultant hospital doctors. All walk-in patients requiring review by a doctor are seen by, or their case is discussed with, a consultant. Nursing out-patient clinics are being planned for education and vaccine administration which will be overseen by a consultant.</P>
    <P>Quality assurance is of major importance to the centre, and a comprehensive risk management programme is in place, together with a comprehensive staff education programme. Regular audit is undertaken and an external reviewer has been appointed. The centre, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and my Department are currently in the process of enhancing a quality assurance programme which will define a new standard of excellence in keeping with the best international standards for the delivery of haemophilia care. The centre has an active research and development programme which has made an outstanding international contribution in recent years to the area of clotting and bleeding disorders.</P>
    <P>The service offered by the national centre is now firmly patient orientated. Three-monthly meetings are held with the Irish Haemophilia Society to integrate patients' views into clinical practice. A comment-complaint box is available at the centre and a prospective patient satisfaction survey is undertaken continuously. Consideration has also been given to non-medical patient needs in delivery of service, for example by the provision of a children's play area in the waiting room.</P>
    <P>The improvement in facilities at the national centre is not the only change which have taken place in recent years. Significant improvements have been made to enhance the quality and safety of blood products.</P>
    <P>Following the Finlay tribunal report, a multi-million pound investment programme was <Col N="112" />approved to support the re-organisation and re-development of the Irish blood transfusion service nationally. The primary objective was to ensure that the IBTS is resourced to provide a transfusion service in line with best international standards. Significant additional resources were made available to the IBTS to support the following programmes: provision of a new national headquarters at a cost of approximately &euro;46 million, including design, project management and so on; development of a new components processing laboratory and other improvements at the Cork centre; implementation of a new IT system at a total cost of approximately &euro;9 million; the introduction of new technologies such as PCR testing and leucodepletion to improve the safety of the blood supply, at a total annual cost of &euro;6 million; and additional senior staff appointments, which have resulted in the establishment of new personnel and finance departments.</P>
    <P>The Department has resourced the recruitment of additional medical consultants. The Department also approved the recruitment of four additional quality assurance staff, including two posts for the Cork centre. The annual cost of the development programme, excluding capital funding, was approximately &euro;8.25 million.</P>
    <P>Significant investment has been made in local donor recruitment initiatives. Decentralised mobile collection teams have been established in Ardee, County Louth and Carlow and a new team has recently been established in Tuam, County Galway. These teams augment the existing collection services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I referred to the funding which was provided by my Department for the introduction of new tests. In fact, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has introduced major new testing programmes in advance of most other transfusion centres internationally and continuously monitors international developments in this regard. All of these developments will undoubtedly contribute to a modern and re-invigorated blood transfusion service to meet the challenges of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I will now address the recommendations made by Judge Lindsay in her report. The first recommendation relates to the quality of the blood products supplied to persons with haemophilia. The recommendation states:</P>
    <P>The blood products supplied to persons with haemophilia should be of the highest standard and of the safest nature that are available. The tribunal believes that this is the situation at present but this must continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>I might explain at this point that the products purchased in this country for use by people with the most common clotting factor deficiencies are no longer made from blood but are recombinant or synthetic products. Towards the end of the 1990s, recombinant products were developed which offered a greater margin of safety with regard to the transmission of infections. At the <Col N="113" />end of 1997, the Department approved the replacement of plasma-derived Factor 8 with a recombinant product. The replacement process was put into effect immediately during 1998. The Department also approved in advance the replacement of the plasma-derived Factor 9 product. As soon as the recombinant product became available in early 1999 it replaced the plasma-derived product. Ireland has been one of the world leaders in transferring patients to these products and is committed to the continued use of the safest and most efficacious products available. In that regard, the tribunal found that the situation in Ireland now compares very favourably with many other countries and was remarked upon by many of the international experts who gave evidence to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the recombinant products are significantly more expensive than the equivalent blood product. However, recent media coverage of the costs of this treatment have been misleading and encroached on considerations of patient confidentiality, about which I have concerns. I understand this has caused great distress to the haemophilia community, and my only reaction to this reportage is to state that I am profoundly grateful that products of this efficacy and safety are now available. If any group of patients in our society is entitled to be treated with the best products on the market, it is surely the haemophilia population.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation in the report refers to the formation of a national committee. The recommendation states:</P>
    <P>A co-ordinating committee in regard to the treatment and care of persons with haemophilia should be established, properly resourced and have adequate personnel and office facilities available to it. Consideration should be given to have the committee established pursuant to statute to ensure its efficient and effective operation.</P>
    <P>When I met with the members of the Irish Haemophilia Society recently, I gave them my personal commitment that substantial progress would be made on this matter as quickly as possible, and if feasible, the committee would be established by the spring of next year. My Department is engaged in ongoing discussions with the society regarding the structure and terms of reference of this committee. Suggested membership might include a range of interests, for example, nominees from clinicians who are working in haemophilia treatment and in paediatric haemophilia services, the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, nursing and infectious diseases consultant representatives, with health board and Department of Health and Children representatives also.</P>
    <P>The model adopted in the case of hepatitis C has worked very effectively. The consultative council on hepatitis C was established under statute and meets regularly to consider all aspects of hepatitis C, in particular the organisation, deliv<Col N="114" />ery and confidentiality of services; the current and emerging health needs of persons with hepatitis C and the publication of information on hepatitis C. The council operates on the basis of equality and teamwork and has proved a useful forum for pursuing issues of national concern and for responding to patient advocacy and consumer input.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the National Haemophilia Committee will establish sub-committees to work on specific areas. Most importantly, the product selection and monitoring committee will oversee the process of tendering and selection of products and the quality assurance of all aspects of the delivery chain. The purpose of the product selection and monitoring committee will be to ensure the availability of an adequate and ongoing supply of clotting factor concentrates that meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy. The process by which this is achieved will involve consumers, service providers and administrators acting in partnership. It is also vital that the work of this committee will be guided and informed by emerging national and international developments and standards.</P>
    <P>Last year, I was asked by the Irish Haemophilia Society to establish a product selection group on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, and I was happy to do so. The group comprises the main stakeholders, including treating clinicians, the IBTS and the Irish Haemophilia Society. My Department has acted as facilitators to this process since its inception. The group has met on a number of occasions over the past year. As a result of its endeavours, this <i>ad hoc</i> group has already undertaken substantial work on the terms of reference which will guide the work of the product selection and monitoring committee in the context of the new national framework.</P>
    <P>It is significant to note that, as I have just mentioned, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a part of the current <i>ad hoc</i> product selection group. As part of its deliberations, the group considered the issue of the continued role of the IBTS in this process. It is a testimony to the considerable changes which have been brought about in the IBTS by the dedication of its management and staff, together with the support of my Department, that all parties, including the Irish Haemophilia Society, are agreed that the IBTS has the necessary expertise, personnel and systems to play a continuing role in the product selection and monitoring process.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation contained in the Lindsay report calls for &ldquo;greater co-operation and exchange of information among the various doctors who treat and care for persons with haemophilia&rdquo;. My Department is in discussion with the Irish Haematology Society, individual treating consultants and the Irish Haemophilia Society as to how best to progress this recommendation, and it will continue to work with those agencies and bodies to bring that process to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" />The fourth recommendation states, &ldquo;A sufficient number of consultant haematologists should be appointed&rdquo;. Substantial progress has already been made in this regard since Comhairle na nOspidéal reported on the issue of consultant haematology posts in 1999. In 1996 there were just 15 consultant haematologists in the country. In its report, Comhairle recommended 39 posts for health boards and a further eight in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. Of the posts recommended in 1999, 27 have been filled and a further six which have been approved are in the process of being filled. Three posts not included in the Comhairle report have also been filled in the eastern region.</P>
    <P>The fifth recommendation relates to the area of medical records and specifically states &ldquo;Medical records should be kept and maintained in a more satisfactory manner&rdquo;. The tribunal noted that during the course of its work, it was &ldquo;struck by the unsatisfactory and incomplete nature of the medical records which were available in regard to particular patients&rdquo;. The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Of course, this may have been caused to some degree by the passage of time, but nonetheless record keeping seems to have been uneven and incomplete. It may well be that the greater use of computer records has already brought about improvements in this area.</P>
    <P>This is obviously an area which must be addressed and my Department has initiated discussions with treating consultants.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary for hospitals involved in haemophilia care to examine the record systems in current use and agree on a format for improving record keeping in a consistent fashion. This process will be examined in conjunction with a proposal to develop a national database to which each treating consultant will contribute.</P>

Deputy McManus correctly asked this morning if we could adjourn this and give more time later on and the Taoiseach agreed. We came in today thinking we had three hours, only to find that an hour and a half had been taken up with a private notice question, which people on the other side of the House are entitled to table, but which ate into the time for this debate. I find that unsatisfactory. I thought I had a three-hour slot to deal with this. It is not my fault.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes the publication of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of persons with hae<Col N="118" />mophilia, and related matters and acknowledges the gravity of its findings;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;accepts in full the findings in the report;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledges the extraordinary suffering endured by those persons with haemophilia who were infected, and by their families, and acknowledges the harrowing personal testimonies given to the tribunal of inquiry by some of those who have suffered;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;notes and acknowledges the widespread sense of public dismay at the matters disclosed in the report;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;supports the Government decision to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;supports the Government's commitment to implement the recommendations in the report, and specifically to appoint a National Haemophilia Co-ordinating Committee, and appropriate subcommittees, on a statutory basis;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;acknowledges the high standard of care currently being provided to persons with haemophilia and supports the Government's undertaking to work in partnership with the Irish Haemophilia Society and treating clinicians to ensure that the highest standards of health care continue to be made available; </P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;supports the Government's commitment to ensuring the availability of an adequate and ongoing supply of clotting factor concentrates that meet the highest national and international standards of safety and efficacy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Minister for Health and Children).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I glossed over recommendation six, which concerned the records of the National Centre. We will agree with that and we will keep the Irish Haemophilia Society informed.</P>
      <P>The seventh recommendation by Ms Justice Lindsay addresses an area of great concern. &ldquo;Doctors should ensure that test results in relation to patients are given to them as soon as such results become available, unless there is compelling medical reason to the contrary, and that appropriate support and counselling is available.&rdquo; In order to ensure that every effort has been made to identify, contact and offer hepatitis and HIV screening to any recipient of a blood product that may have been infected, the health boards, in conjunction with the National Centre and the IBTS and with the support of the Irish Haemophilia Society, will undertake another examination of hospital records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation process with clinicians involved in the management of haemophilia has commenced. Discussions have also been initiated with the Irish Haematology Society, to which the consultants are affiliated. In the short-term, however, all health boards have nominated a consultant haematologist or equivalent to assist in <Col N="119" />carrying out another examination of all hospital records to ensure that anyone who may have been exposed to potentially infected blood products and who may still be unaware of the risks from such exposure is contacted and invited for hepatitis or HIV testing. Appropriate counselling and supports will be available to anyone who may be identified in this examination.</P>
    <P>The final recommendation refers to procedures to be followed in relation to any new tests. The tribunal report says: &ldquo;The Irish Blood Transfusion Service should establish protocols to ensure that, with any future new tests for infective agents, positive test results are communicated to the relevant donor as soon as possible, referral is made to counselling services, and look back procedures are put in place.&rdquo; These protocols are currently in place at the IBTS and will continue to be followed in the future whenever any new tests are introduced.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined, the Government is fully committed to implementing the recommendations of the report in partnership with the Irish Haemophilia Society and the other stakeholders. I have already mentioned that discussions have commenced between the IHS and my Department in this regard. I hope the implementation of the report will mark a new way forward which will allow all those with an interest in the care and treatment of persons with haemophilia, together with haemophiliacs themselves, to play their part in what must be, from here on, a collaborative and inclusive process.</P>
    <P>I have already described how the principle of patient advocacy and consumer input already works particularly well in the Consultative Council on Hepatitis C. The four main patient support groups &ndash; Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Haemophilia Society &ndash; perform a vital role as advocates for their members and are represented on the consultative council. As well as this, regular meetings are held at national level between the support groups, service providers and the Department in order to monitor services and identify emerging needs on an ongoing basis. Hepatitis C liaison officers in each health board co-ordinate primary care services and provide a contact point for hepatitis C patients and the four support groups. Relationships are also being developed at regional as well as national level. The support groups also meet individual hospitals and consultants to discuss specific issues of concern to their members. In addition, the effective working relationship between the National Centre and the Irish Haemophilia Society has already been referred to.</P>
    <P>The Government particularly appreciates the efforts of the Irish Haemophilia Society to enter into a meaningful dialogue on the future direction of the haemophilia services. The society, as recognised in the tribunal report, has played a seminal part in representing their members' best interests at all times. The Department provides funding on <Col N="120" />an ongoing basis to the IHS in respect of support services for its members and similarly funds the other support groups representing persons with hepatitis C. Over the past five years my Department, through the Eastern Regional Health Authority, has provided cumulative funding of more than &euro;1 million to the society. It has asked me to consider increasing this funding and I am committed to providing a substantial increase in funding for next year. Officials from my Department will discuss with the society the best way in which to target this additional funding.</P>
    <P>As well as funding for the support groups, the provision of targeted funding for the development of primary care and hospital services has also been recognised by the support groups as being an important element in the overall model of services for persons with hepatitis C. My Department, and successive Ministers for Health, have reiterated the commitment to provide sufficient funding for the continued development of services for persons with hepatitis C and HIV. The Consultative Council on Hepatitis C and the support groups are agreed that funding to date has been satisfactory and look forward to the continued provision of funding at a level sufficient to maintain and develop services which are responsive to emerging needs.</P>
    <P>In her report, Ms Justice Lindsay said it was inappropriate to make any comment in relation to the possibility of a future tribunal of inquiry into the actions of certain pharmaceutical companies, since I had commissioned and obtained independent advice on the matter. As the tribunal is an independent entity, its conclusions in this regard must be respected. Ms Justice Lindsay's findings in this matter were made in accordance with her statutory terms of reference, which were agreed after long and careful consideration.</P>
    <P>On 7 November 2001 I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, Senior Counsel, to advise me on a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia. As part of his investigations Mr. Gardiner liaised with the solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society. He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in HIV-haemophilia litigation in the United States. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm in relation to the matters relevant to his investigations. I have had full consultations with Mr. Gardiner and, subject to further discussion with the Attorney General, I believe it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would allow access to publicly available material and to persons and bodies willing to co-operate. I am in consultation with the Attorney General and all other parties, including the Irish Haemophilia Society, on an effective template, and I will return to all concerned parties with proposals.</P>
    <P>I know I have the full support of the House in reiterating that while we acknowledge the mis<Col N="121" />takes of the past, there is an ongoing need to protect and maintain the national blood supply. To ensure that blood is available whenever and wherever needed, it is imperative that donors are encouraged to give blood, and to continue to do so on a regular basis. This year, despite all the adverse publicity, the level of donations has been very high and I commend those who have demonstrated true generosity of spirit by taking time out of their busy schedules to think of the needs of others. However, because of the short shelf life of blood and blood products and the seasonal variations in donation patterns, it is essential that people continue to donate blood regularly.</P>
    <P>It was the Government's priority that this motion was brought before the House as soon as possible, and it will be our priority to implement its recommendations. I am sure I speak for everyone in the House in expressing our sorrow at the suffering that people with haemophilia have endured and resolving that a similar tragedy will never happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add the following to the motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;calls on the Government to initiate the promised inquiry into the relevant international pharmaceutical companies; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;supports the provision of adequate funding to the Irish Haemophilia Society on an ongoing basis to allow the society to fully represent the  interests of people with haemophilia.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing additional time to discuss this report. It is without question the biggest medical catastrophe ever to happen in the history of the State where 260 people and their families were literally devastated by the actions of a State agency. We now have a report which took three years and &euro;12 million to prepare and it deserves our detailed attention.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be aware that the haemophilia society has prepared a 30 page response to the report in which it is extremely critical of the manner in which the inquiry was conducted and presented. It vigorously disputes some of the critical findings of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am acutely conscious that in 20 minutes I cannot even begin to touch on many of the serious issues the society raised. I could not even read its concerns into the record in any great detail. It is essential that all the issues are given the attention they deserve. There is one point I want to make because it came across to me very strongly in the IHS response and in my discussions with it. This relates to the general sense of dissatisfaction and disillusionment of the society with the whole tribunal experience rather than just with the report. While it acknowledged the tribunal had value in giving at least some public expression and appreciation of the extent of the calamity which befell victims, it expressed very severe disappointment at the failure of the report to identify <Col N="122" />the individual people responsible for what happened. Dissatisfaction with the report goes even further. I genuinely believe that the failure to find individuals culpable might not have been so important had the whole tribunal experience been a happier one or if the victims felt it was sympathetic to them. However, their experience was the reverse. They felt from the outset that the extent of the catastrophe which befell them was in some sense downgraded or belittled by the appointment of a Circuit Court judge, while a beef tribunal merited a High Court president. They cite the time allotted to the debate, which I am pleased has been increased, relative to the time given to the Flood tribunal, even its interim report, and the difference in the cost of the two reports, as indicating that one was far more important to the public than the other and was, therefore, made more available. This reflected the unsympathetic approach of the State and its continuing unwillingness to recognise the magnitude of what had happened. Above all, it was the adversarial attitude of the tribunal which hurt most. They cite comments such as that of the tribunal's senior counsel that the tribunal should not over-indulge a witness giving evidence on the death of her father. How insensitive can one be? How could one possibly over-indulge someone in these circumstances at a tribunal that was supposed to be sympathetic to those affected? In another incident during the course of the inquiry one witness, who I believe was infected with HIV, was asked how did he spend his compensation money, as if he should apologise or explain or that it was somehow frivolous of him to have spent his money. They complain also of difficulties in accessing data and documentation, and primarily of the refusal of the tribunal to pursue particular lines of inquiry which the haemophilia society felt were absolutely crucial to getting to the truth. No one knew more about the truth than the victims.</P>
    <P>These and many other actions in the course of the tribunal left the haemophilia society and its members with a general sense that they, as the clear victims, somehow were the defendants. I am raising this point on their behalf for two reasons. First, it is a tragedy and travesty that despite all they have been through and all we now know, they are left with a feeling that there is an ongoing denial by the State and its agencies of responsibility for what happened to them and, second, it goes to the very heart of what tribunals in their various manifestations are about. If we want a tribunal to establish culpability and heads to roll, then the terms of reference must clearly say so. The manner in which the tribunal is conducted will then inevitably be adversarial. If we want to get to the truth &ndash; this tribunal did not get to the truth &ndash; and establish what happened and why it happened, so that we can ensure it does not happen again, then the manner of a tribunal should be merely inquisitorial.</P>
    <P>The haemophilia sufferers went into this tribunal believing that it would be inquisitorial in <Col N="123" />nature. Certainly the terms of reference implied that was what was expected of it. For instance, the terms of reference referred to the adequacy of procedures and criterion, the timeliness of actions and so on. It was about finding out why these people were infected with products prepared and supplied to them or procured for them by a State agency. If that had been established with any degree of clarify, the haemophilia society would now view the report in a very different light. It would feel it had its say, that the anguish of its members had in some way been acknowledged and it would be confident that a similar catastrophe could never happen in the future. Instead what it got was an adversarial tribunal with inquisitorial terms of reference. In these circumstances, there could never be a happy or satisfactory outcome from anyone's point of view. The need to be defensive and deny would always get in the way of establishing the truth. I mention this because as a country we will go down the road of having tribunals every time there is a failure of due process. As it appears that is the way we are going, there are important lessons to be learned from the experience of the tribunal and the general sense of dissatisfaction with the report of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>When I first saw the report, I, in common with everyone else, was appalled at the absence of clear and concise conclusions. On reading it, I realise it is not that there are no conclusions. Certainly the tribunal reached conclusions and formed views on most of what was required of it under its terms of reference. However, the conclusions, such as they were, were buried in the body of the report. The report is not well produced or laid out. The conclusions were difficult to find and very easy to miss. The method of dividing examination of each term of reference over a discrete number of years &ndash; I can understand why that was done &ndash; added to the confusion and took from the effect of any conclusions reached. Where there were criticisms of inaction or failure of judgment of either individuals or bodies, they were almost always qualified in some way as if to reduce the responsibility by offering a mitigating context.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the tribunal, we have a fairly painstaking account of who knew what and who did what at various times. However, following three years of an inquiry and a cost of &euro;12 million we still do not know why this happened. After reading the report a couple of times, and rereading parts that seemed confusing, I do not have a sense of what happened. We do not know why hundreds of sick, vulnerable, dependant and trusting people were fatally infected or had their lives destroyed by the actions of a State agency.</P>
    <P>In setting up a tribunal to discover the truth, surely the least we could expect is to find out the answer to that question. For those infected and their families the overriding question is: &ldquo;Why did this happen to us?&rdquo;. The answer to that basic question just does not emerge, even from the <Col N="124" />most detailed reading. Certainly, issues and moments which are referred to could be regarded as critical to what happened, such as the decision to concentrate on a particular method to achieve self sufficiency in the national blood supply or the failure to recall non heat-treated products during certain critical months in 1985. However, none of these, nor any of the other issues examined, together give us a comprehensive explanation of why the blood gathering and testing system so utterly failed to protect the people it was designed to serve.</P>
    <P>As well as being an important question for the families affected, the &ldquo;why&rdquo; is also a vital question for anyone who intends to use the health service. If we do not know why this disaster happened, how can we ensure that a similar disaster never happens again? If a tribunal of this kind is to have any lasting value, it must contribute such an outcome. Having read the report, I have no conclusive sense of what set in motion this catastrophic chain of events and why serious errors of judgment were repeated and compounded almost up to the present day. Instead, any reader of this report is left with the impression of a blood service in total disarray, under resourced with poor records, little or no effective management, a poor chain of command and a lack of decision-making ability or any sense of management responsibility to implement decisions. Significantly, there was an absolute failure of communication, both within the BTSB and between it and those providing care and treatment to the haemophiliac community. Perhaps it is within this amalgam of disastrous management, communications and structural deficiencies we find a multi-faceted answer as to what happened, rather than in any one action of one individual or agency. I intend to return to this when dealing with the recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to deal with all of the reservations expressed by the Haemophilia Society but I will raise one issue with regard to the conduct of the inquiry. I find it quite inexplicable that the tribunal did not interview the members of the board of the BTSB at any stage. Although there are references in the report to what the board might have known and when it might have known it, nobody ever asked the board members directly what they knew. Three members of the board, who were possibly also members of staff, were interviewed. Whatever the board knew or should have known is a critical issue. In any organisation, responsibility rests ultimately with the board. The chairperson was appointed by the Minister and there was always a Department representative on the board, acting as the eyes and ears of the Minister. The point at which alarm bells rang in the Department depended on their communication with the Minister. If those alarm bells had rung earlier, a great deal of anguish could have been avoided. As the Minister will recall, the issue of what information went from the board to the Government ultimately led to the fall of a Government. It also led to further hurt on the <Col N="125" />community because the level of compensation was based on what we now know to have been misinformation about the source of infection and the responsibility for it. The role of the board was crucial but that was ignored. It was almost as if the board was a disinterested party to the whole series of events.</P>
    <P>If anything of value is to emerge from this tribunal, it is in looking to the recommendations, to which I am glad to note the Minister paid particular attention. They were of a general nature and could apply to almost any organisation. However, the deficiencies in the structures, communications, records and information flows within the BTSB were at the root of what actually happened. While I appreciate that the Minister has put substantial investment into the new blood service, it will require more than just putting in money. Very careful monitoring will also be required.</P>
    <P>In the short time remaining to me in this debate, I will refer to two of the requirements of the Haemophilia Society, both of which appear as amendments. The Minister has already referred to the possibility of an investigation into the role of the international drug companies. Wherever that may lead, they should not be let off scot free. An investigation is worthwhile and I accept the Minister's good faith and commitment in that regard. I regret the lack of details at this stage and I will return to this again.</P>
    <P>The other requirement of the Haemophilia Society is adequate funding for its very important advocacy and support work for its community. It is not tolerable that the society should have to fund-raise among its own devastated community to provide supports to its members. The funding needs to be doubled and I ask the Minister to consider that seriously. I do not wish to divide the House on this but it is an important issue and we owe haemophiliacs that much at least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am recording that point with the Minister. In welcoming the report I echo the concerns of victims and their families about the reluctance of the report to assign responsibility for the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of haemophiliacs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" />It is disappointing that the tribunal chairperson did not deliver the report in a more clear and concise manner, including an executive summary of its findings. The report should have indicated what was outlined by the Irish Haemophiliac Society, namely, what went wrong, who was responsible and recommendations to prevent future repetition.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin broadly supports the Government's motion, particularly the sections acknowledging the extraordinary suffering endured by haemophiliacs who were infected with HIV and/or hepatitis C. I support the amendments tabled by the Fine Gael and Labour parties. I welcome the Government's commitment to implement the recommendations in the report and its commitment to ensure the viability of an adequate and ongoing supply of clotting factor concentrates that meet the highest national and international standards of safety and efficacy.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin welcomes the Government's decision to refer this report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, I am concerned that, as with the report of the Finlay tribunal, there is a question mark as to whether prosecutions will result. The failure to prosecute those responsible for the tragic blood contamination scandals which have occurred in Ireland contrasts poorly with other countries which have experienced similar blood contamination scandals in recent years. In France and Portugal, those involved in such scandals have gone to trial for fraud, criminal negligence, failing to adequately screen blood and for propagating contagious diseases.</P>
    <P>The failure of the tribunal to investigate certain matters becomes clear upon reading this report. Why were all the board members of the BTSB not called to give evidence, given that Judge Lindsay notes in the report that &ldquo;on the tribunal's analysis, the board was not entirely blameless&rdquo;? Why did the tribunal not investigate various Ministers for Health who had ultimate responsibility for policy decisions such as the non-implementation of national policy in respect of the Council of Europe recommendations. I am particularly concerned by Judge Lindsay's decision not to comment in detail on the appropriateness of the response of the Department of Health and Children to the infections on the grounds that the current Minister had reviewed compensation for those involved.</P>
    <P>The report also fails to deal with the conflict of interest of the late Mr. Seán Hanratty, the BTSB's former chief technical officer. Mr. Hanratty was a director and founder of Accuscience, a company which acted as an intermediary for Miles Laboratories Incorporated, which supplied non-heat treated and unscreened &ldquo;cutter&rdquo; products which were responsible for some of the Irish infections. Mr. Hanratty was one of those who had a key role in deciding which products were used and was the person who, after litigation had commenced, destroyed BTSB paperwork which could have identified precisely which products caused infection. The destruction of these docu<Col N="130" />ments has made it impossible to trace some 20 people who may be infected with HIV as a result of having been given blood products manufactured from donations from HIV-infected donors. It must be asked why the tribunal did not investigate the conduct of Mr. Hanratty. It looked at the decision in June 1988 to continue supplying a product over which its manufacturers, Armour Pharmaceuticals, if not the agency itself seemed to have major safety concerns. Though evidence was given to the tribunal of the knowledge of Armour Pharmaceuticals of the HIV infection risk posed by Armour products and that they continued to distribute those products in Ireland, the Lindsay report does not include any criticisms of Armour.</P>
    <P>At a time when the people of the State are becoming increasingly concerned at the probability of further health cutbacks in the forthcoming budget, this report is a timely reminder of the harm that such measures have caused in the past. There is evidence that cutbacks in State health funding in the late 1980s were a contributory factor in the disaster that befell these innocent victims. Events referred to in this report should be seen against a background of an underfunded and overstretched health service and I hope the Minister will note those concerns.</P>
    <P>The report concludes, on page 122, that the tribunal does not accept that decisions taken by the BTSB in regard to the distribution or supply of blood products were in any way compromised by financial considerations. This, however, does not equate with Professor Temperley's statement in 1989, and quoted in the report, that &ldquo;some balance will have to be struck between cost and the infection dangers associated with blood products&rdquo;. The report does not deal adequately with the question as to whether the prioritising of monetary considerations occurred at the expense of the safety of people with haemophilia. It is remarkable that the tribunal did not accept that the decision by the BTSB with regard to the distribution of blood products was in any way compromised by financial considerations. I find that difficult to accept.</P>

      <P>In part six of Judge Lindsay's report she refuses to comment on the possibility of a future tribunal of inquiry into the role of the international drug companies regarding the infection of persons with haemophilia in this country. The Minister sought and has obtained a report from Mr. Paul Gardiner SC in regard to this matter. Will the Minister release Mr. Gardiner's report and will he establish an adjudicative tribunal to investigate the role of the pharmaceutical companies? The pharmaceutical companies are the focus of both amendments before us, and I have already indicated support for them. It is imperative that the full role of those companies and that full information, particularly Mr. Gardiner's report, is made available to all Members. I hope the Minister will affirm in his reply that he is prepared to co-operate with that request.</P>
      <P>The haemophilia society's own briefing in relation to Judge Lindsay's report says that in essence Judge Lindsay felt it would be &ldquo;unfair to extend the tribunal's remit and investigate the pharmaceutical companies at that late stage.&rdquo;  It appears from the sequence of correspondence that it was never the intention of the Lindsay tribunal to investigate these pharmaceutical companies which were responsible for the manufacture of blood products that infected 97 haemophiliacs with HIV and many more people with hepatitis C. The society's notes indicate that blood products manufactured by these companies were responsible for the death of 74 Irish citizens. It is most important that a commitment is made to pursue the pharmaceutical companies with vigour and to ensure that responsibility in that area, as well as other areas of this tragic story, is firmly established and followed by prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The victims of this tragedy sought accountability from this report. Instead, after long deliberation, the Lindsay report is a vague product which fails to hold anyone ultimately responsible. The language used in the report is in marked contrast to that used in the definite conclusions of the second interim report of the Flood tribunal. This cannot have escaped the attention of anyone in the Chamber. It certainly has not escaped the attention of the people most concerned, namely those who deserved that this report would properly reflect on their experiences, pain and suffering and on the need for truth and justice to be established. It is regrettable that the Lindsay tribunal did not do more to bring closure to this tragic episode in the history of the blood services. It is essential now that we restore by every means <Col N="133" />and effort the confidence of the public in the accountability of the blood services. I call on the Minister to do this.</P>

For over two years it negotiated with the Government to establish this tribunal. It was a process fraught with difficulty and great hopes were generated when the terms of reference were finally agreed. It was accepted at the time that the tribunal would and could investigate fully the circumstances that led to haemophiliacs contracting HIV infection and hepatitis C from contaminated blood products.

      <P>The investigation was to include in its brief the role of international pharmaceutical companies and the role of the BTSB in the use of its own products. One lesson that should have been learned from the Finlay tribunal was how crucial terms of reference can be. In that case the terms of reference were flawed because they failed to encapsulate an investigation of the circumstances of infection of people with haemophilia or hepatitis C. The Irish Haemophilia Society, at the time, was forced to withdraw from the process. In the case of the Lindsay tribunal, the terms of reference were supposed to provide for a comprehensive investigation into all aspects of the blood scandal as it related to haemophiliacs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate on the establishment of the tribunal in May 1999, I urged the Minister to ensure there was resolute analysis of products which <Col N="134" />came into the country and, if needs be, legal action to obtain the evidence about their origins, but that did not happen. I asked that there be full disclosure from the BTSB of all documentation, and that did not happen. Those who suffered so much were entitled to know how and why the disaster happened and who was responsible. Regrettably and tragically, that did not happen either. In fact, during the tribunal the Irish Haemophilia Society was often thwarted and blocked in its search for the truth. While it did its work, some of its members suffered and died because they had been poisoned by contaminated blood products. Others lived and continue to live with terrible infections. For the first time, Irish people learned the real extent of their horror and heartbreak.</P>
    <P>The testimony of haemophiliacs at the tribunal was harrowing. One young man lost his mother and two brothers as a result of the blood contamination scandal. A young mother has three sons who contracted hepatitis C as a result of an infected blood product. Even after these children were diagnosed as hepatitis C positive, they were left untreated for five years. Theirs are terrible, tragic stories that should never have had to be told. It required fortitude and courage to come into the tribunal for these people to tell of their experience. They did the country a great service. It is a pity that the State did not return the compliment.</P>
    <P>In France when the scandal of contaminated blood was discovered, the state began a legal process that proved effective. People went to jail in France and a Minister ended up prosecuted through the courts. In Ireland we set up a tribunal in good faith. Our aim was to bring some closure and comfort for victims and for the families of victims. It was also to find out who did what and who was responsible for this catastrophe. Neither aim has been realised.</P>
    <P>The report does not come to clear conclusions. It does not apportion responsibility even though profound questions needed to be answered. The outcome is, in effect, a crime that has many victims and yet no perpetrators. We have all heard of a victimless crime. According to the report, it would appear that this was an offenderless crime. A total of 79 people died and yet no one is responsible.</P>
    <P>There is a terrible symmetry about the fact that this debate is taking place soon after the debate in this House on the Flood tribunal report. In 1989 when Ray Burke received up to £100,000 in corrupt payments the Government at the time collapsed because it refused to allocate a few hundred thousand pounds as compensation to haemophiliacs who received contaminated blood products. The two reports, one on the issue of political corruption, the other on matters of life and death, were published within weeks of each other. It says a lot about the strange priorities of this House that the Flood tribunal report was given top billing and was debated in the first days of the Dáil's new session while those who have <Col N="135" />suffered so much were made wait until the third week before the Lindsay tribunal report was debated. The contrast between the two reports is very stark and the Lindsay tribunal report is a disappointment for the families of haemophiliacs. While the Flood tribunal report uses clear, concise and devastating language to lay blame squarely, the Lindsay tribunal report has set out to describe a tragedy unparalleled in modern Irish history in words that are simply inadequate to the task. No one in this report is culpable or negligent.</P>
    <P>As a report it is a great disappointment, but as a record it raises questions that are not going to disappear into the ether. This morning on behalf of the Labour Party I sought more time in the House to allow Deputies the chance to debate this report.</P>

      <P>As a report it is a great disappointment, but as a record it raises questions that are not going to disappear into the ether. This morning I sought more time in the House to debate the report because it is important that it be subject to full scrutiny and analysis. There is also something deeply offensive about giving less than a three hour debate, which turned out to be an hour and a half, to this tribunal report while more than two days of Dáil time was given to the Flood tribunal report. I welcome the response from the Taoiseach in this regard and that the Whips have agreed on extra time to be allocated. I look forward to hearing the speeches of other Deputies, some of whom have, unfortunately, left the House, but I hope they give their views now that they have an opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose that the tribunal be subject to scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Health and Children. The many aspects of this report can be <Col N="136" />given extended time and consideration in committee that is simply not possible in this format in the House. Even allowing for the restrictions put on us by the court decision in the Abbeylara case, the committee has a contribution to make and I propose that we embark on such a project when the new committee is constituted.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing aspect of this investigation is the role played by the BTSB regarding information it had in 1986 about the HIV infection of seven people, some of whom died, as a consequence of the use of Factor 9, a product made by the BTSB. In effect this was an Irish product made from Irish blood. When the tribunal examined this, it found there was an &ldquo;ambivalence and blurring of the facts&rdquo;. I disagree with the report and agree with the Irish Haemophilia Society which maintains that there was a cover-up of the facts. Sadly, I can only say that it is a matter of opinion. The reason we cannot be definitive is because the Lindsay tribunal never called the chairman of the board to attend. Had the judge done so or had she even asked other members of the board to attend to ask straight questions of them, we would know the full facts and be able to debate them.</P>
    <P>The Irish Haemophilia Society stated in its analysis of the report:</P>
    <P>Mr. Keyes in his evidence referred to the BTSB coding their minutes. At one stage the minutes referred to &ldquo;the executive consultant informed the board that the situation with regard to Factor 9 was unsatisfactory and he was examining this as a matter of urgency and he requested that one of our consultants meet Prof. Temperley to review standards&rdquo;. This would clearly seem to be a reference to the infection of BTSB Factor 9 with HIV. According to Mr. Keyes's evidence this is what it refers to. It is surely beyond the bounds of possibility that any semi-intelligent group of people sitting on a board, when told about an unfortunate situation with regard to a product, would not have at least asked:</P>
    <P>(a) What was the situation which had arisen, and</P>
    <P>(b) What urgent attention was it receiving and why was it necessary?</P>
    <P>Professor Temperley complained that he was becoming a bore, constantly telling the board with regard to the responsibility of Factor 9 for HIV infections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was starting to recognise the position of the parents bereaved in such circumstances. One has to try to put oneself in their position to fully recognise and appreciate the degree to which their loss registers with them. First, there is the loss at the death of their child and this affects both parents, but particularly the mother. Subsequent to that there comes another loss, the recognition that, for the benefit of medical science or whatever, part of the child was retained without consent. The consent issue was the most hurtful and all of the parents in such cases pointed out that if at least they had been consulted they would have had the right to agree or not, but the fact that this matter was decided arbitrarily without a reference to them and was ongoing for a considerable time serves only to magnify the degree of hurt and anguish that was originally caused when their child passed away.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has attempted to address the issues the parents' group has raised, but whatever it takes to meet the requirements of the parents who have been bereaved and treated in this fashion should be done. I know that one cannot always do the things that are deemed to be required, but in circumstances such as these a special effort should be made simply because we are dealing with the issue of innocent children. Something was decided outside of their control and without reference to their parents. Something was decided, the implication of which would have an ongoing impact on the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When older people pass away they should have lived a full life. When a child passes away the parents can only surmise what that child might have <Col N="139" />become and how he or she might have lived his or her life to the full extent the parents had done. To feel that part of that image the parents have is taken away and destroyed by the manner in which it was done is unfortunate to say the least.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to facilitate the concerns legitimately expressed by the parents arising from this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Keaveney, Cooper-Flynn, Dennehy, O'Connor and Mary Wallace.</P>
      <P>The loss of a child is a traumatic event in any parent's life and the additional distress caused to parents and siblings as a result of post mortem practice is surely almost unbearable. I join with my colleagues here in expressing heartfelt sympathy to the members of Parents for Justice and all who have lost their loved ones. All of us have had contact with some of the people involved in and associated with this organisation.</P>
      <P>We all recall the media reports and revelations in 1999, which caused parents of children who died in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin to query the hospital's practice in the area of removal and retention of organs. Concern was expressed over the hospital's participation in the extraction of pituitary glands from deceased children. It was suggested these organs were passed on to a pharmaceutical company and we know the rest. Parents of these children whose organs had been retained formed a support group called Parents for Justice.</P>
      <P>They met the Minister who, in fairness to him, provided the necessary administrative and financial support to facilitate the establishment of the group. That group has done sterling work. The Minister had detailed discussions with that group and its legal advisers to agree on the format of an inquiry. At all times the priority was to respect the person's privacy and confidentiality while at the same time encouraging all relevant parties to give evidence to that inquiry.</P>
      <P>In April 2000, the Government decided to establish a non-statutory inquiry. The Minister had further consultations and arising from those discussions agreed that when the report of the inquiry came to hand he would refer it to the Joint Committee on Health and Children. He allowed the committee to decide whether to conduct hearings in relation to the report and if it considered it appropriate to avail of powers to call witnesses. We all know that other events have intervened in the area of the committees' rights to call witnesses and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ms Anne Dunne SC was appointed to chair the inquiry and in December 1999 the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children wrote to the health boards and the voluntary hospitals indicating the format and scope of the inquiry and requesting their support. Hospitals were requested to put in place structures to support help lines to ensure inquiries from parents and next of kin were quickly addressed and fol<Col N="140" />lowed up. Some did this and did a good job, but regrettably some merely nodded in the direction of the wishes of the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officer also requested that retained organs and tissue should be securely and properly stored, documented and organised in a manner that would facilitate early identification and retrieval for parents and families. He requested that medical and other records be assembled in advance so as to be available when sought and financial support arrangements were to be provided in individual cases to families who wished to make private arrangements for the interment of retained organs.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform got involved in the role of the Coroner's Court, etc. The original timeframe for the inquiry was 18 months and this expired in early December 2001. The Parents for Justice group broadly expressed its satisfaction with the process earlier this year. However, we also know that as the knowledge dawned on everyone that the initial phase work would continue indefinitely, it understandably expressed its concern. That only six of the 11 key hospitals provided information is a source of concern.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is keen to continue with a very focused inquiry. He is as committed as he ever was to ensuring the Oireachtas plays a role. If a role can be found for the committee system, it will be used; if not, another forum will be found. I support the Minister's amendment and I urge all those who are in a position to do so to re-engage in discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to extend my sympathy to those involved in what is a difficult situation for them. As other speakers have said a death in a family has huge repercussions but the death of a young person or baby is more difficult. Not everyone knows what is behind the procedure of a post mortem but people understand it is necessary medically or else it would not be done. However, having coped with death and the fact that the post mortem has to be held, to find that without consultation organs have been removed and retained, stored or disposed of without the consent or the prior knowledge of the family involved must add a grievance and a very serious burden to families already coping with a heavy burden.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children is very focused and well disposed to trying to resolve sensitive issues such as this. He has reacted and engaged with the group. Since April he has got a Government decision to set up the inquiry to review the post mortem practice, policy and procedure in the State right back to 1970 with particular reference to organ removal, retention and disposal and to the prevailing standards inside and outside the State. It is not much consolation to know that this procedure was carried out in other countries but it shows we were not alone. We must relate to prevailing standards even if we have to ensure that those standards are changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" />Everyone welcomed both the appointment of Anne Dunne SC as chairman and the fact that she was given the appropriate support staff and resources. The terms of reference were set, interpreted and published, contracts were invited and things moved on in 2001 through discovery. It would be an understatement to say it is a disappointment that things have not advanced further. The group involved was happy with the procedure that was in place but when one looks at the huge amount of information coming forward, one must welcome the fact that the hospitals have come up with details of what was going on. They have put their hands up and stated what was going on. We would like that concluded so that all the evidence is brought forward and investigated.</P>
    <P>The difficulty now is that while we can praise the sensitivity of the work that has been done and we want to see the job completed, we need the terms of reference tightened in consultation with the Parents for Justice group. We need a finite timescale in as far as that is possible by focusing on the main hospitals concerned. The breadth of material to be dealt with could lead to this inquiry running <i>ad infinitum,</i> so its focus needs to be sharpened.</P>
    <P>I am a convenor of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and we have made concentrated efforts with other sensitive issues in depth. We were looking forward to the opportunity of coming to terms with this issue but the committee structure is not in place at present and I await the final judgment as to whether this matter will come before the committee. If it does it will get the interest required and the committee will go to any lengths necessary to deal with it. However, that issue is still in the air and people have different opinions as to whether it will happen.</P>
    <P>As a member of the North-Western Health Board I am assured by the board's executive that full co-operation is promised and ongoing. That must become a national trend. It is important to know that this will not happen again for any reason. Medical research and education are important but they were not the only factors in this situation. Organ donation should be offered and not taken.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be insensitive but voluntary organ donation is important and we should press for it. We should be advocating that people carry the organ donor card, families should be aware of it and organ donation should be discussed. That is not to underestimate this situation, where people did not know what was going on and were denied the right to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if the non-statutory option cannot be pursued he promised to find another mechanism. As I said, if I am on the health committee we will be doing our best to proceed with this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister and other speakers in offering my sympathy to the parents affected by unapproved organ removal <Col N="142" />and retention. Like other speakers I have friends and acquaintances who have suffered in this regard, though it is only in the recent past they have discovered what happened. I am conscious in each case that this knowledge has added huge weight to their original trauma and sense of loss. It is very hard to sympathise properly with people but we must make the effort. In doing so we must have regard for their wishes to make sure everything is examined fully and, as Deputy Keaveney said, to come up with positive resolutions.</P>
      <P>The trauma of losing a child at any stage is bad enough but this adds to the trauma and we resent it. What happened reflected a culture of arrogance that existed in certain disciplines and professions and probably still exists to a certain extent in some areas. Any similar occurrences must be stopped immediately and that is why we need information. As legislators we must ensure the proper statutory rules are put in place and that the regulations are in place so that we will not hear of similar events in future. This area must be regulated properly and to recognise what has occurred already a proper inquiry must be held. I welcome the determination of my constituency colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to have a full and speedy investigation into organ removal, storage and disposal. It can be difficult to get the balance right between the need for a speedy programme of investigation and giving full satisfaction to people that all the details are brought to light. In the past we have imposed timeframes which have hindered us in the long run.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Keaveney that some of the bravest and most positive people I have met are those who donated their organs or bodies to medical research in order to help future generations. This practice needs to be encouraged but organ donation must be voluntary. It should be encouraged and protected as those who donate their organs are brave and committed to society.</P>

      <P>I am glad to express my solidarity with the Parents for Justice group, which gives a voice to children who cannot speak. As a new Member I have on occasion felt let down that when issues of great importance &ndash; an issue of tragic impact in this case &ndash; are before the House the motions do not challenge the <i>status quo,</i> nor do they seek to identify alternative ideas or advance additional action, where a Minister and his official would be made to justify their actions.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>For me it is important that the issue receives a deserved hearing and that our input, detailed or general, be acknowledged by a Minister and his officials in their future actions. I am very upset that the tragic and emotional case of organ retention continues to be the subject of investigation and that the timescales as outlined <Col N="143" />in the Minister's announcement in April 2002 have not been met. I have been contacted by many parents in my constituency of Dublin South-West I know parents who are deeply hurt by what has happened and I cannot help but feel anger, as they do, at what has happened or indeed what appears not to be happening now. The parents in my constituency and all the parents affected want these awful actions to be finally reported on and the consequences agreed and dealt with. This is a personal family issue that is sensitive and produces raw emotions dealing with the most basic event, the birth and then tragic death of a baby.</P>
      <P>I support the actions taken by the Minister and the procedures to be followed to investigate and resolve this act of indifference. The delays, whether caused by resource difficulties or procedural bottlenecks, are totally unacceptable. If there are difficulties, they should be reported. There should be communication with both the affected parents and the public at large. This will not go away. The issues and actions need to be resolved.</P>
      <P>The Minister should ensure that his officials support the working of the Dunne inquiry. While accepting that his Department has a broad agenda, he should remind officials that these delays affect people's lives and those of their families in a most cruel fashion. I record my admiration for the work done by the Parents for Justice group which has been a tireless advocate for and support to the parents affected by the actions of yet another trusted pillar of our society who, on the face of it, appears to have been found wanting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. It is a very sensitive and emotional subject for anyone involved and for those who know parents who have suffered the tragic loss of a child and now find themselves embroiled in this inquiry. I recognise that important work must be done. I commend the Minister for taking the necessary steps to initiate this inquiry and for doing so in a sensitive manner.</P>
      <P>I could not take issue with the Parents for Justice group. It is only right and proper that the Minister has consulted them every step of the way to ensure that this inquiry is conducted in an efficient manner to produce a result as quickly as possible. The Minister outlined the background to the inquiry in his speech last night. There were over 1,700 inquiries of major hospitals from parents and this shows the level and depth of concern.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it is possible for anyone to understand what it is to lose a child and then undergo the added distress of discovering that organs had been retained after the post mortem process without parental permission. One must go through this to understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" />Deputy O'Connor made the point that if it is a matter of resources, if it is a matter of getting the full co-operation of everybody involved, every step should be taken to ensure that the matter is dealt with as quickly as possible. There are many parents who want to contribute to the inquiry, and health boards and hospitals need to be consulted. This will take time. It is important that all the facts are discovered to ensure that in the future proper procedures are followed.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the inquiry are very wide. It might be better to focus the inquiry more. Very wide terms of reference cause a long delay. This issue came into the public domain in 1999 and this inquiry was set up in 2000 so it is reasonable to expect a result within a period of 18 months even if a large amount of consultation must take place. The longer is goes on the more distressing it is for everybody and the inquiry may lose its focus. It is important that the inquiry retain the co-operation of the Parents for Justice group and the next of kin. The inquiry must provide them with the answers to the essential questions they need to ask and ensure that correct procedures are put in place for the future. The Minister has met with the Parents for Justice group on many occasions and the inquiry had its support until recently. Every effort must be made to ensure that continues.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Western Health Board, and when the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children made contact with the health board, support was forthcoming. Each health board must co-operate with the inquiry. Much progress has been made and we would all like to see the process completed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney spoke about the importance of the donation of organs. A constituent of mine has spent 18 months in Mayo General Hospital on a transplant list and is badly in need of a lung transplant. Everybody in the medical world recognises the importance of donors but in this case there was retention and storage of organs without the consent of the parents. It is a terrible situation which must be investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate will achieve much. I thank the Deputies who put down the motion and I thank the Minister for his openness and frankness last night. We all want to move forward in a comprehensive and speedy manner. Great trauma and heartbreak is experienced by the families involved. I am pleased that last night the Minister accepted that there is a problem with the timeframe, that there is room for further discussion and that he is available for those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bereavement is always difficult but the trauma of the death of a child is without doubt the most difficult. It brings with it a huge loss and at times unbearable grief. The families concerned have suffered much and have been further traumatised by their discovery of the retention of their children's organs. They ask for a process which will deal with this in a focused way. Reasonable clos<Col N="145" />ure is very important in these cases and it will be very unfair to these families if the process is to drag on indefinitely. Last night's debate secured public assurances from the Minister that are very important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn and others referred to the 18-month timeframe, which is an issue of concern for all of us. We heard the Minister say last night that the way in which the timescale can be shortened is to give the inquiry a much sharper focus through addressing the issue of the terms of reference and that he would only do this in partnership and in consultation with Parents for Justice. Commitments on the statutory phase are also very important. The Minister gave a public commitment regarding the statutory phase of the investigation. He clarified that if it transpires that it is not possible to do so through an Oireachtas committee due to the Abbeylara case, he is committed to ensuring that it is done through another appropriate forum with statutory powers. The Minister's public assurance on the appropriate forum with statutory powers is important. It gives a clear direction and it is a public commitment. Consent is the key issue being debated. I welcome the Minister's commitment to produce legislation to regulate in this area. We all want to be as certain as we can regarding existing practices in our hospitals. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Parents for Justice and others for the awareness created around this issue which brought about the correspondence in December 1999 from the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children to all health boards and hospitals to ensure that all hospitals put in place a policy of informed consent by next-of-kin and that proper procedures be put in place. I ask the Minister to appoint one of his officials to ensure that this has been done and that there is a clear policy of consent in all hospitals on these issues.</P>
    <P>This debate has provided a basis for moving forward on the issue, in particular, because of the public assurances provided by the Minister. I hope that as a result of this debate further discussions can take place to ensure a speedy and comprehensive closure to this important issue. I reiterate the debt of gratitude owed by all of us to Parents for Justice and others who have highlighted an area where protocols, procedures and regulations were long overdue. We acknowledge the great pain these people are now experiencing and progress made in this area will be to the good of everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Lynch and Kenny.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party supports this motion because it recognises the legitimate concerns of the parents of deceased children while also acknowledging the importance of medical research in the protection of lives and the health of children generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No loss can compare with the loss of a child. Those of us who have not experienced such <Col N="146" />tragedy can only imagine how unbearable such a death can be but any one of us can know and understand that parents do not fully recover from it. In the past the need to grieve over a death was imperfectly understood. Women who experienced still births or babies who died at birth, for example, were presumed not to feel the need to grieve. Nowadays the practice in maternity hospitals towards mothers in these circumstances has changed dramatically and only for the good. Today much more is understood about human emotions and there is, generally speaking, a climate that is sensitive to the needs of those who are bereft.</P>
    <P>That said, the medical practice of organ retention and the Government response has proved sadly deficient and, although changes in medical practice have been introduced, the required political action has not. The point has now been reached where the parents of children whose organs were retained by hospitals without their consent have withdrawn their support from the inquiry process established in response to their requests. The patience of Parents for Justice reached breaking point. As their chairperson, Fionnuala O'Reilly recently stated: &ldquo;We started asking questions in December 1999 and we are none the wiser.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is worth restating the background to this decision to withdraw from the process. On 25 March 2001 the public notice was published in the media of the terms of reference of the post mortem inquiry. In that notice it was stated that the inquiry would make its final report, including its findings to the Minister for Health and Children, within six months. That was clearly stated in the advertisement. It was a commitment that reinforced the Minister's promise that the report would be completed within six months. Some 18 months later, there is still no sign of the report. It would appear to be bogged down. It is timely and proper that we ask the Minister for Health and Children about a process that has slowed down so much. He was asked by Parents for Justice to establish a statutory inquiry with the powers of compellability and discovery but he chose instead to set up a non-statutory inquiry chaired by Ms Anne Dunne, SC. The arguments against a full inquiry had a certain weight in terms of costs and complexity and the parents to their credit accepted the Minister's proposal, albeit reluctantly. However, their trust has been undermined by their experience since. The inquiry is still not completed. Recently Ms Dunne stated &ndash; it was reinforced by the Minister for Health and Children &ndash; that the report would not be available for &ldquo;some considerable time&rdquo;. This month apparently an interim report has been presented to the Department but it has not been published so the public cannot judge whether real progress has been made. The Minister stated that six of the 11 key hospitals had provided information and that oral submissions had been heard from 78 parents or next of kin. Some 328 parents or next of kin <Col N="147" />have yet to be heard so we are not even half way through that process.</P>
    <P>The cloud of secrecy surrounding the entire process is unhelpful to building confidence. Submissions have been sought and received by the inquiry but nobody knows who has submitted to the inquiry and how frank or informative they have been. The scale of compliance or otherwise is simply not known.</P>
    <P>A private inquiry makes sense if it moves speedily to a conclusion so that the next stage of inquiry may start. We have seen that process work well in relation to the Bermingham inquiry into clerical sex abuse in the diocese of Ferns. Already the next stage of that inquiry is about to begin. I sincerely hope the lessons from the Dunne inquiry are taken on board when that other area of grave public concern is being considered.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking back to experience in Britain which first brought to public attention the serious ethical, medical and legal aspects of the policy and practice of organ retention. The policy related in the main to research and exploration on the causes of death but the practice meant that parents were not informed, let alone consulted, about the removal of organs from the bodies of their children and their subsequent storage or disposal. This discovery was the cause of considerable grief and deep distress among families who had already suffered a terrible bereavement &ndash; unnecessary grief that could have been avoided if a more sensitive approach had been adopted by hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger of judging these things with hindsight but it shows up a failure of understanding as well as an inevitable gap between those who avail of health services and those who work on a daily basis treating illness and trying to discover scientifically how to prevent premature death. I suppose it was as much a symptom of a mindset of the &ldquo;don't worry, doctor knows best&rdquo; variety as it was ignorance of human needs and emotions.</P>
    <P>I support this motion and ask the Minister to pay more attention to and to understand the importance of greater urgency in relation to this issue. His original plan to refer it to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children is clearly in difficulty because of the Abbeylara decision. In the meantime, he might refer the heads of the human tissues Bill, on which his Department is presumably working, to the committee because it would give us the opportunity to start to scrutinise these issues. The Minister must recognise that the system he put in place is not delivering and that he will have to develop a sharper focus and put in place the statutory phase. This needs to be done quickly to reassure parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Ms Lynch Ms Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for sharing her time. Each November for the last ten years a ceremony takes place in at least two <Col N="148" />graveyards in Cork city to allow parents of children who were stillborn and those who have miscarried or who have lost children at the early stages of life to come together to celebrate those lives despite the fact they were short.</P>
      <P>One year I attended with someone who needed to be there and I met a couple in their 70s. I was astonished to see them and I thought they were there because of the loss of a grandchild or because of friends. Speaking to them afterwards, I discovered they were there because they had had a stillborn child. The mother told me she was there because it was the first opportunity she had to grieve for that child. She had the baby at a time when it was thought there was no need to grieve or that one could not possibly miss a child if they had not lived for very long. Yet, after all those years, she was still grieving.</P>
      <P>When I first heard about organ retention and Parents for Justice, it struck me very forcefully that if that couple, despite being in their 70s, had at that point been faced with the knowledge that their child had a post mortem performed on it and that there were still organs retained, it would have resurrected all the awfulness of losing the child in the first place. That is something we desperately need to keep in mind.</P>
      <P>We all accept that post mortem examination has a vital role to play in determining the cause of death. We also accept that information gathered can be of significant benefit to medical discovery and treatment. Most people, when faced with an informed choice as to whether or not a post mortem is to take place, will usually conclude that it will help others and that therefore it should go ahead. I notice the figure has dropped dramatically in recent times, and you cannot blame people for this.</P>
      <P>When Parents for Justice were confronted with this information, it must have been like having their awful experiences resurrected. It was bad enough that they had to deal with it for the second time, but they were then given hope in so far as they were asked to co-operate in a certain way in order to find out when and why it had happened and how the matter could be put to rest. However, those hopes were then dashed because there is still no information or report after 18 months. We should not be asking why they are getting so upset, but why they have been so patient having suffered what they did.</P>
      <P>There are certain questions which need to be answered. Can the Minister tell us how long it will be before we can expect to have an interim report, or indeed a full report? What was the relevance of the Minister quoting the 1832 Act in the House last night? Were doctors under the impression that they were still operating under that Act? People are very concerned and desperately anxious to know. Has it been established that research was actually carried out on the organs that were removed? What was that research? What benefit had it? What were the conclusions? If no research was carried out, why were the organs removed in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" />The motion is timely and worthy, and the Labour Party has no difficulty supporting it. We hope that some of the questions being asked by Parents for Justice will be answered here tonight and that some kind of hope can be offered to these people. I am sure the Minister will agree they have suffered enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus and the Labour Party for allowing me speak on this motion. It is important that the political process attempts to appreciate the concern, sensitivity and depth of grief of the parents affected by this issue. Death is always tragic, and the death of an infant or young child is probably the most traumatic experience for any parent. Compounding that death and loss with the knowledge that a child's organs may well have been retained without consent causes a feeling of guilt that becomes worse as time goes on. The very least these mothers and fathers are entitled to is the truth, on which no cost can be put.</P>
      <P>They have got to live with this everyday of their lives, and for those whom I have met who have experienced this depth of grief, it is as valid today as it was 20 years ago, or whenever it happened. I feel very strongly that in this case, these parents deserve the truth. The motion calls for a statutory inquiry. There are questions to be asked, and for parents to call to a hospital 20 or 30 times to inquire about the organs of their infant or child, only to be rebuffed by the establishment or persons within the health authorities, is a cause of extreme anxiety and grief.</P>
      <P>I commend the people who set up Parents for Justice and who have had the courage to stand by their convictions in respect of finding out the truth about their children. The question for this establishment is whether this should be a statutory inquiry. Dunne seems to have run into dry sand in terms of the complications arising from the Abbeylara inquiry. The Minister might wish to tell us why no reply was received by Parents for Justice to a letter they sent on 16 August, in which they recommended that the Justice O'Leary-Ansbacher formula was acceptable in terms of finding out the necessary information.</P>
      <P>Clarity should be given to the House on how the money has been spent to date, how much information has been collected and why parents have not been called in to give their views, ask their questions and provide information. Why can we not find out who the personnel were who authorised retention of organs in the first instance? Why can we not find out who authorised the sale of organs in the first instance, when consent may have been given had it actually been requested from parents in the first place? These are the sensitive issues that cause real problems every day of the week for parents involved, and the loss of their children forever is a cause of extreme and deep grief for as long as they live. The feeling of guilt that they may have is compounded by the State's lack of ability to provide information, answers and the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" />Whether it is a statutory inquiry based on the motion, an Ansbacher style formula acceptable to Parents for Justice, or some other re-drafting of the existing terms of reference is a question I am not competent to answer. What I am competent to say, as a parent of young children, is that whatever happens the State should devise whatever formula is necessary to provide information and answers and to tell these people the truth. They deserve that, and they should not have to continue indefinitely not knowing the answers to questions about their children and not being given information about organs taken from their children without consent. That shock, horror and guilt has to rest with them for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>I am very supportive of the necessity to give these parents the absolute truth. There is no point in being in politics if we cannot answer questions for the people who put us here in the first place. There are questions that can and should be answered by personnel in various hospitals. There should be no cover up as to what has happened. This is a public service. It is a human and personal requirement. If the House cannot arrive at a definitive conclusion as to how to get at the truth, it is failing these people in its duty. I am supportive of what they are doing. No price can be put on the truth which would ease and console those who have lost children in such harrowing and tragic circumstances. The tragedy was compounded by unauthorised intrusion and invasion by the State.</P>

      <P>We are Members at a time when many events are coming to light which shame us about the nature of the society in which we live. Our political and judicial systems are struggling to keep pace, whether with issues of political or business corruption, institutional or child abuse, or the many scandals that have been visited in other areas of the health service, particularly in relation to the transmission and transfusion of blood products. The organ retention scandal is another on that list. At this time of many crises it would be easy to be over-shocked and unable to respond adequately to what is another scandal. As Members we have a responsibility to challenge the Government to ensure the right thing is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a constituency colleague of the Minister for Health and Children, I do not doubt either his personal interest or his experience in seeing that this issue is dealt with properly. Efforts have been made to establish the initial inquiry and to progress it. We need to know why certain things have not been done. That the main legislation governing the use of human anatomy is 170 years old and predates the existence of the State by 100 <Col N="151" />years means that even the 18 months we waited for Dunne to report could have been used to develop suitable legislation to update this area. We have to be conscious that we are not talking about stillbirths or infant deaths but children of many ages and at all stages of development. One such case drawn to my attention at briefings with the Parents for Justice group is that of a 12 year old girl, practically a young woman, who was the same age as my daughter. We have to keep it in context. While there was uninformed consent in regard to the use of various organs of the young people concerned, consent was often given for removal of specific organs and then that consent was abused. We are talking about actions that in any civilised, moral, ethical society should be deemed criminal. Any examination of those circumstances must mean that those who committed such acts are identified and brought to account and the system transformed appropriately.</P>
    <P>The Parents for Justice group has co-operated to the greatest extent possible with what has been proposed by the Government to date. To be fair, the proposal for a non-statutory inquiry to be followed by a hearing by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, pre the Abbeylara court decision, appeared to have a logic at that time. Unfortunately, the decision of the Supreme Court in the Abbeylara case means that is no longer a mechanism open to this House. It no longer seems to be the mechanism that will elicit the maximum amount of information for those who require it or deliver the plan of action towards solving many of the continuing difficulties in this area.</P>
    <P>A statutory inquiry is necessary in respect of the organ retention scandal because of the need to find out the extent and purpose of the removal of pituitary glands from young people and their transmission to commercial companies for use in the pharmaceutical industry. If we are not prepared to ask those questions in the strictly judicial and legal sense we are avoiding our responsibilities and denying the rights of those affected.</P>
    <P>When I was first elected to a local authority over ten years ago, a distinction I share with Deputy Lynch, there was a local controversy in one of our maternity hospitals about the same practice in relation to placenta. The consent did not exist there either. Placenta is a material that is part of the birthing process and the women concerned. This is a development even beyond that. The removal of a vital gland in terms of the growth and development of young people desecrates the dignity of the human person. If we are prepared to stand over such practices the political system has failed.</P>
    <P>An issue that needs to be raised in respect of the inquiry is whether the terms of reference given to Ms Dunne are too wide ranging, need to be more focused, and her ability to conduct a full and wide ranging campaign while at the same time juggling a private practice and committing this report to paper. It is not acceptable that the <Col N="152" />inquiry is being done under those terms. It should be a full time activity with a specified time frame and those involved have every right to ask for such a time frame.</P>
    <P>In his contribution last night the Minister said the Laffoy Commission was established after the original terms of reference had been drawn up. I found it difficult to understand his argument. He said this mechanism was not proposed in the first instance because it had not been practised. It has since come into being and yet he is not prepared to put it in practice subsequently. While the Minister may have the best intentions he is making a bad situation worse. We have to accept that the Dunne inquiry as it exists lacks credibility with those who have the greatest interest in what it is likely to report. Therefore, we have to put in place better measures that will meet those concerns.</P>
    <P>I hope by the end of the debate that the Minister or his representative will be convinced by the many arguments from this side that the effect of his amendment is to prolong the agony of many involved in this scandal. There is a need for a clear and unequivocal acceptance of what is proposed in the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>The men and women who packed the public gallery last night and those here tonight are no closer to the answers they seek. They are watching us in judgment, angry at our inability and at the inability of the State to fulfil its duty to them. I cannot pretend to know the suffering these people have endured. I can only admire their courage and determination which has brought them this far. Hopefully, their burning desire for justice will carry them through the long days ahead. They have already accomplished a great deal. Different practices in terms of informed consent now exists in hospitals across the country but at what cost? </P>
      <P>Any one of the thousands affected by the loss of loved ones in these circumstances will say that questions have not been answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They want to know why the medical profession did not ask the parents for their permission to remove the organs. The only answer appears to be that they did not need to do so. The families want to know the location of their loved ones' organs. They want closure on the deaths of their loved ones, but they cannot have that if they do not know the whereabouts of the organs of their loved ones. Are they in their graves, or are some other child's organs in their grave? How many more years will they have to wait? The cold and callous pillars of the medical profession, who devised a system whereby the organs were stolen from the families without their permission and sold to the pharmaceutical industry, stored in jars for years or incinerated with hospital waste, continue to work in the heart of the medical system. Many of us heard the harrowing stories involved in the blood transfusion scandal. We thought we had heard it all, especially the callous way the news was broken to patients who were terminally <Col N="153" />ill, but the families involved in this scandal experienced a similar attitude from the medical profession.</P>
    <P>A family from Tallaght to whom I spoke lost their child because he was given the wrong medication by a doctor. They were told a year later that their child's heart, lungs and kidneys had been removed. Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin told them that it had the lungs and kidneys but that the heart was sent to Beaumont Hospital. The father was blamed for the decrease in organ donations when he rang the hospital and when he inquired about the child's heart he was told it had been incinerated months ago. He was then told by Crumlin hospital that they had the three organs. He was tempted to open the casket to see what was inside. He still does not know to this day whose organs are buried in child's grave. He lives with that pain. He is on valium. He is separated from his wife, and from day to day he lives with that pain. He does not want compensation, as was suggested to him. How can anyone be compensated for that sense of loss?</P>
    <P>In his comments last night the Minister made no mention of when the core demands of Parents for Justice and an element of our motion that calls upon the Government to publish a human tissue Act will be met. The Minister repeatedly assured the Parents for Justice group that this legislation would be brought forward, yet it is not in the Government's legislative programme. When does he plan to bring forward this legislation? That is the question the people in the Gallery want answered, as I do. Can he say anything to the parents tonight to assure them that justice will be done or to put their pain to rest? I ask those questions of the Minister not to try to score points but to articulate the pain and the agony experienced by these families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The unauthorised harvesting of body organs from deceased children by otherwise reputable hospitals constitutes one of the greatest scandals ever perpetrated on unsuspecting parents in this country. Just like the clerical child abuse scandal, it appears to have been going on systematically for many years before it came to light, and it makes one wonder about the extent of the evil that has been committed. It is truly a nauseating story where pathologists performing post mortems cynically took advantage of unsuspecting parents to remove organs from their beloved children on a vast scale.</P>
      <P>The scandal is compounded by the hospitals' cynical practice of selling human pituitary glands, which they had extracted from deceased children, to the giant pharmaceutical company, Pharmacia, for use in the manufacture of human growth hormones. In return, Pharmacia made the paltry gesture of donating £109.50 to the hospital concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where consent has been given, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the removal of small samples of body tissue at post mortems for the <Col N="154" />purpose of determining the cause of death of the individual. There was no suggestion that pathologists were being granted rights to strip children's bodies of organs for future research by commercial companies or in the hospital itself.</P>
    <P>An appalling lack of sensitivity was shown to non-medically qualified parents in the midst of their grief in requesting the retention of tissue samples from the bodies of their children, unaware of what they were agreeing. They believed, presumably, that small samples of skin would be taken and that the bodies of their children would be returned more or less intact. Unfortunately, the reality was otherwise and, naturally, parents feel outraged and shocked at the revelations of the past several years.</P>
    <P>If we donate our bodies to medical science on our deaths in the pursuance of medical advances, we accept the reality that it will be mutilated, dissected and torn apart, and perhaps not treated with the dignity one would otherwise expect. However, if agreement has not been given, it is not surprising that there is such an outcry from particularly vulnerable parents when their children's bodies are similarly treated. In many cases, the discovery that they have interred their baby's body believing it to be intact when it may not have been has almost destroyed them. The introduction of new post mortem practices at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children Crumlin, involving a more comprehensive consent procedure for parents, is a small step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Dunne inquiry was set up on a non-statutory basis in March 2000 to investigate allegations that organs of deceased children had been removed without their parents consent in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children Crumlin and in more than 70 hospitals throughout the country. However, the Parents for Justice group, established in 1999, is totally frustrated and disillusioned and it has withdrawn its co-operation with the inquiry since last week. It is of the view that the Dunne inquiry should be designated as a statutory inquiry with full powers to compel witnesses to attend and documents to be disclosed; compel co-operation by some hospitals and key medical staff who have been slow to respond, with adequate sanctions for non-cooperation; remove any gagging orders on parents in the inquiry, investigate breaches of the Coroners Act and births and deaths registration, review past practice regarding post mortem consent, organ retention, disposal of organs at hospitals and disclosure of the material retained and develop guidance in the form of a code of practice on the sensitive issues relating to post mortem examinations, including the consent form and the way hospitals handle the process of seeking consent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, verbally indicated to Parents for Justice that he would present proposals for statutory investigation. Nine letters later he has not responded to the group. It is extraordinary that <Col N="155" />Ministers cannot behave in a way where &ldquo;yes&rdquo; means &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; means &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Double speak breaks down trust, compounding the hurt and sense of loss felt by parents and keeping wounds open instead of helping parents bring to closure that painful period of their lives. Let the Minister determine to do what is best for the parents who have been hurt and upset. Past practices were totally unacceptable and must not be repeated in the future.</P>

      <P>I am sure I speak for all my colleagues in the House in expressing the deepest regret for the distress caused to members of Parents for Justice by post mortem and organ retention practices, which compounded the pain of having lost a child.</P>
      <P>When the Government decided to set up a non-statutory inquiry into post mortem practices, it did so in good faith believing it was the best option. An acceptable timeframe of 18 months was set for completion of the first phase of the work. The work got under way in March 2001 and the 18 months period expired in September of this year. Regrettably, it is now clear that this work will take considerably longer.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, and that of the Minister, Deputy Martin, that the investigation into organ retention issues will have a statutory phase. If it transpires that it is not possible to do so through an Oireachtas committee, I am committed to ensuring that it is done through another appropriate forum with statutory powers.</P>
      <P>I regret that Parents for Justice has decided to withdraw from the inquiry process, although I understand it. I urge it to reconsider entering into discussions on how the present impasse can be resolved. I reassure it that if it were a simple matter of changing the format of Ms Dunne's phase of the inquiry into a statutory format I would support this wholeheartedly. However, there is a much more fundamental problem in the original terms of reference for the inquiry.</P>
      <P>Like some Deputies who have contributed to this debate and made the point about the focus of the inquiry, I believe that the only way in which the timescale can be shortened is to give the inquiry a much sharper focus in consultation with Parents for Justice and other relevant parties. However, I am open to positive suggestions to make progress. I invite Parents for Justice to rejoin the process and assist in achieving mutually agreed objectives. We must all work together in partnership to resolve this problem. We must get to the facts, but we must do so within a realistic timeframe which does not prolong the suffering of bereaved parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the distress the uncertain timescale for the work of the inquiry has caused to members of Parents for Justice. I share their concern that this should be resolved in a more timely fashion. I urge them, however, to consider further engagement with the Department and officials to <Col N="156" />make progress and I reiterate the invitation of my friend and colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, our door is open to them at any time. We need to explore the options available in relation to this inquiry. While we all agree that there is no quick fix, I am sure with the support and assistance of Parents for Justice and in consultation with the relevant parties agreement can be reached to ensure that the inquiry is brought to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>As this is the first opportunity I have had to intervene in this discussion on the Private Members' motion put down by the Technical Group, I welcome Parents for Justice to Dáil Éireann and acknowledge the large numbers that have turned out on both nights &ndash; eloquent testimony to how this issue affects people to the very core. This matter must be brought to a conclusion, as far as the State is concerned, with the utmost expedition, with the understanding that the pain, in various forms, will unfortunately not be brought to such a speedy conclusion. Parents for Justice has organised in a model way to give voice to those suffering from a grievous wrong.</P>
      <P>I ask the Dáil to reflect on this. This is the third discussion today in which serious issues of great sensitivity with a certain connection between them have come before the Dáil. Earlier we discussed the violation of innocents by elements in the Catholic Church. We then discussed the unspeakable tragedy of the poisoning of haemophiliacs with contaminated blood products and now we are discussing the unbelievable insensitivity of hospitals and sections of the medical profession in dealing with parents whose children died in infancy and the pain caused by the retention of human organs with no reference whatsoever to parents. The connection between the three is the grotesque abuse of a position of power and authority by those with responsibility.</P>
      <P>In the cases of contaminated blood and the retention of organs, the authorities concerned were public bodies directly under the responsibility of Government and Dáil Éireann and as such, the Government and the Dáil have a heavy responsibility to right the wrongs that were done, in this case, to parents and their innocent deceased children. There is no need for me to repeat the eloquent examples of human trauma suffered by parents caught up in this sorry situation. The presence of so many parents here tonight speaks volumes. Sadly, the Minister for Health and Children, in response to our motion, is not meeting the needs of the moment, particularly the needs of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promise of the Minister was a two-stage inquiry. The first stage would be the type of inquiry that is going on at present under the <Col N="157" />chairmanship of Ms Dunne and then it would move on to a statutory phase in the Joint Committee on Health and Children. The Minister said in his speech last night: &ldquo;If it transpires that it is not possible to do so through an Oireachtas committee . . .  I am committed to ensuring that it is done through another appropriate forum with statutory powers.&rdquo; What is the Minister waiting for? The Abbeylara judgment means that there is no point in going to the Joint Committee on Health and Children with this at this time. We are, unfortunately, awaiting an explanation of the tragedy of the innocent man in that case, John Carthy.</P>
    <P>Why delay in this instance when it is clear that until the Dáil changes the law fundamentally the joint committee cannot have an effective investigation into this matter to bring it to closure? It will bring further pain to people to have to wait for the report and then they will go on another carousel of pain while they see whether that report can be considered with effectiveness by the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Let us move immediately to the statutory process. The non-statutory process was announced on 4 April 2000. The Minister said in last night's speech, in a by-the-way fashion, that so far six of 11 key hospitals have provided information. What immediately leaps off the page is that five key hospitals have not, a full two and a half years after the investigation was set in train. Which hospitals are these and why have they not provided the information in this huge amount of time? This shows the limits of the present inquiry.</P>
    <P>Parents caught up in this tragedy have specifically asked me to say that they are not opposed to the use of human organs to facilitate the advancement of knowledge of disease or as a contribution to facilitating the ending of disease and the prevention of further tragedy. They are in favour of that provided it is done with their consent and with the dignity that should be afforded all involved. The Government should explain the code for the retention of human organs and why the recommendations of the working group for the coroner service have not been enshrined in law and put into effect. Much of what the Parents for Justice are looking for is encoded in the report. I call on the Government and the Minister to move immediately to a statutory inquiry. The parents did not lightly remove themselves from the current inquiry. The Government should sit down with the parents and agree new terms of reference that will allow for the expeditious conclusion of a sorry episode in the annals of the health service.</P>
    <P>Let us end the scandal of the expenditure on this inquiry. Some &euro;5.3 million has been expended while just 78 of the 328 parents involved have had an opportunity to be heard. The Government should explain where the money has gone. These inquiries are becoming a source of scandal because the legal profession is eating up so many of the funds that should go towards facilitating and resourcing Parents for <Col N="158" />Justice in many of their aims and in facilitating the healing process.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Government just appealing to the parents to rejoin the inquiry. They have removed themselves with cause and not lightly. Let us move on and bring closure to this episode in so far as the responsibility of the Dáil and Government is concerned.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, and all the members of the Technical Group. In closing this debate on behalf of the Technical Group, I would like to thank Deputies on all sides of the House who took part. Last night and again tonight we have heard thoughtful contributions on a very difficult and sensitive issue. There is widespread consensus about the need for truth and justice for the bereaved parents and their families. We in this House, and the Government on our behalf, are duty bound to meet their demand for a statutory inquiry which will uncover the facts.</P>
      <P>I want to acknowledge the importance of a related insensitive and uncaring practice which I hope has now been eliminated totally, namely, the disgraceful practice of the disposal of the dead bodies of unborn children, lost as a result of miscarriages. These dead children were disposed of as hospital waste or retained in the same manner as organs without the knowledge or consent of their parents. The pain and indelible sense of loss and the recurring anguish of parents who have suffered such loss lives with some for a lifetime. This is something to which we may return on another day.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister's speech last night &ndash; I am disappointed he was not here during the debate this evening &ndash; caused disappointment to Parents for Justice. &ldquo;Cold comfort&rdquo; was one of the milder descriptions they gave me of how they viewed the Minister's speech. I would like at this juncture to join with other colleagues in acknowledging again the number of parents in the Public Gallery tonight. Many have travelled long distances, as others did last evening. It is important to emphasise, as they would wish, that their search for the truth is not a threat to organ donation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt the personal sincerity of the Minister with regard to this very sensitive issue. However, I doubt the capacity of successive Governments to confront the powerful forces in the medical profession who for so long have been a law unto themselves. I accept that much has changed for the better but much remains to be done. I suspect the barriers to this inquiry relate to the reluctance of the powers that be in the health service to accept full openness and full accountability. In my contribution last night I expressed surprise at the reported cost of &euro;4.3 million for the Dunne inquiry thus far. The Minister's revelation that it was, in fact, &euro;5.3 million compounded the sense of alarm and has raised more questions about the conduct of the Dunne <Col N="159" />inquiry, the prospects for its success and the length of time it may continue to deliberate.</P>
    <P>A 55% level of co-operation from hospitals to date is a very poor record. Why is this the case? It appears that just six of the 11 key hospitals have provided information despite the fact the inquiry has been in session for in excess of 18 months. The Minister in his speech stated that once the Dunne inquiry was established he had to step back. I contend there are now so many questions about this inquiry and so many doubts about the prospects for the promised statutory inquiry that the Minister must revisit the issue. Notwithstanding his comments last night, I believe he will do so in due course. In the meantime we must establish when the Dunne inquiry expects to receive all outstanding documentation. We need to know what measures are being taken to pursue hospitals who have failed to submit documentation to the inquiry. Will the inquiry impose a deadline by which date all outstanding documents must be supplied and after which date failure to supply such documentation will be considered as failure to co-operate, and with all the appropriate consequences? We need to establish the level of engagement the inquiry has sought and obtained from consultants, pathologists, coroners and clinicians. In view of the fact that the inquiry has heard just oral submissions from 25% of parents and next-of-kin, we need to know if every family will be afforded the opportunity to provide an oral testimony.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to respond to the alternative proposals from Parents for Justice for the statutory phase of the inquiry. In the absence of his senior colleague, I want the Minister of State and his Department to respond positively and not in the disgraceful manner he responded to my parliamentary question that sought full disclosure of the terms and conditions of the appointment of Ms Anne Dunne, SC, and which <Col N="160" />I have received this evening. For the information of parents in the Gallery this evening, I asked the Minister and he responded last evening that a reply would issue. I asked the Minister for Health and Children the precise terms and conditions of the appointment of Ms Anne Dunne, SC, as chair of the inquiry into post mortem policy and practice. I received a reply this evening which states,</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware from last evening's debate during Private Members' time that Ms Anne Dunne, SC, was invited to chair the post mortem inquiry following a consultative process at Cabinet and with the Attorney General. I formally appointed Ms Dunne as chairperson on 11 April 2000. The agreed terms of reference for the inquiry form the basis for Ms Dunne's task and she published her interpretation thereof in the national press on 23 March 2001.</P>
    <P>That reply from the Minister is in my view yet a further example of the wilful withholding of essential information and will do nothing to bridge the very obvious gap that has opened between the Minister and the Parents for Justice and those who support them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I urge the Government at this late stage to withdraw its amendment and to accept the motion as tabled. The State owes it to the bereaved families to atone for the callous and insensitive practices which we had hoped were banished to the past. It is time the State allowed those who have suffered so much to establish the whole truth. On behalf of Parents for Justice and all who support their most reasonable demands, I urge the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues not to delay another day but to act now and to demonstrate that intention by withdrawing their amendment and voting for the substantive motion which has been before the House last evening and tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this matter. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera. There is irony in the fact that the Minister represented my constituency a number of years ago. She may not wish me to say when, but it was a long time ago when we were both much younger. I am glad there are parents from the parents association of St. Killian's in the gallery tonight. There are also ladies from the Greenhills step dancing group who will remember the Minister of State with great affection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious and important issue for my constituency which I decided to raise on the Adjournment because of my frustration on behalf of the parents, pupils, teachers and everyone concerned with the community in Castleview and Kingswood. There are two schools involved. St. Killian's national school is in the parish of Kingswood Heights, Tallaght, where there is a community of 1,600 houses. St. Killian's school was established in 1979 in that new parish. Due to the pressure of numbers, St. Killian's senior school was built in 1986. The senior school has catered for more than 2,400 children in this time. It was housed in a temporary building which had classrooms only and no additional facilities. The school has no hall and cannot cater for extra-curricular or school activities, including arts, crafts and sports. It has no facilities to cater for the attendance of parents in the school and it has no facilities for the disabled, which is very significant in this day and age. There is an asbestos roof on the junior school. This upsets many people in the <Col N="163" />parish and in Tallaght and clearly needs attention. Many people have said to me that the senior school is literally falling to pieces.</P>
    <P>In moving this Adjournment Debate I stress to the House and the Minster for Education and Science the needs of this parish and the parents who have asked me to do this. I acknowledge the interest the Minister has shown in the case when I have approached him on a number of occasions. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera's presence here tonight. We need to get a positive go ahead for the works in this school. People will talk about what was said and done before the election but, as public representative of Kingswood in recent years and as a new Dáil Deputy, I had a firm conviction that the information coming from the Department of Education and Science told us that these works were going ahead and that is what I told people on the doorsteps. I made no promises but I told them that I have a definite commitment to this school and parish and that I would do all I could to represent their needs to the Minister and the Department and that is what I am doing. I have continued to do so in the 160 days since I became a TD and I will continue to do so, formally and informally and when I have the opportunity to address the House, I will do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister understands this is a serious issue. The Minister of State will have in her brief the information about the works that are needed. Apart from the asbestos roof, which needs to be emphasised, the security fences and other works which are recommended and need to be undertaken have a spin off effect as far as the parish is concerned. The school is suffering, as do many others, from anti-social behaviour and other related problems. I ask the Minister of State to examine the file and communicate my message to the Minister that the works are needed. I do not think the Department is querying that but it is a matter of getting the go ahead, so we can say to the good parents of these pupils in the Castleview schools that these works will go ahead. I ask the Minister of State not only to respond to me tonight but also, within the Department, to initiate a process tomorrow where this whole process is speeded up. It needs to be expedited so we can say when the Estimates are being put to bed that these works will go ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind words at the outset of the debate this evening. I am pleased that the Deputy is one of the TDs for the area he represents and am sure he will do his job well. In the execution of his job, he has brought this matter to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, and myself. I am glad he has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House our Department's current position regarding the proposed refurbishment project at St. <Col N="164" />Killian's junior and senior national schools, Castleview, Tallaght.</P>
      <P>At present, St. Killian's junior school has a staffing level of a principal, 13 mainstream class teachers, a learning support teacher, two resource teachers and a temporary language support teacher. The enrolment at 30 September 2002 was 333 pupils. St. Killian's senior school has a principal, 14 mainstream class teachers, a learning support teacher, a resource teacher and a temporary language support teacher. The enrolment at this school at 30 September 2002 was 358 pupils.</P>
      <P>The junior school's present facilities consist of 16 classrooms, a general purpose room and limited ancillary accommodation. The senior school has 14 classrooms and some limited ancillary accommodation. A project to refurbish the schools and provide additional ancillary accommodation is currently at an advanced stage of planning.</P>
      <P>Our Department has an extensive primary school building programme for 2002 under way, details of which, including a list of 400 major building projects in architectural planning, are available on our website: www.education.ie. Decisions on projects proceeding to tender and construction are taken in light of the annual allocation for primary school buildings, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects.</P>
      <P>Later this year when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, the Minister for Education and Science will frame a further comprehensive programme of works that will proceed to construction and the proposed building project at St. Killian's junior and senior schools will be one of those considered for inclusion in that programme.</P>
      <P>Finally, our Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Killian's junior and senior schools and I wish to thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House. I assure the Deputy that I will pass on his genuine concerns regarding these schools to the Minister for Education and Science tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Deputy Neville has given me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the construction of a new school at St. Nicholas' primary school in Adare, County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the building of a new school at St. Nicholas' primary school in Adare, County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1999, the then Minister for Education, Deputy Martin, was invited by the board of management of St. Nicholas' primary school to visit the school in Adare. At the time of the Minister's visit, the school had a two teacher schoolhouse in the Augustinian abbey which dates to the 16th century. The school was to become a three teacher school that September due to increased <Col N="165" />enrolment. The board of management had already spent a number of years investigating the possibility of converting the adjoining building into a schoolhouse.</P>
    <P>As this is an historic and listed building and an archaeological site, they could not do anything with the original building. Following an inspection of the school and the former schoolhouse by the Minister and his officials, he announced that it would not make financial or educational sense to furnish the building. He informed the board that a new school building should be built. The board proceeded with acquiring the adjoining land as instructed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The school building itself is over 600 years old. Old stone walls are damp and inappropriate as classrooms. Fungal growth is present on some walls. Ventilation is poor as the main windows cannot be left open for safety reasons. The constant dampness affects pupils with asthma. Dehumidification has been attempted numerous times over the years but due to the large air space and high ceilings, it was never effective. The hall and toilet areas are tiled and, because of the high relative humidity and continuous dampness, this area is slippery and a continuous hazard despite repeated attempts to make it safe. Skylights in the classroom roof areas constantly leak causing pupils to get wet while working in class. The heating system is antiquated, inefficient and totally ineffective so portable heaters must be brought into classrooms during the winter.</P>
    <P>Access to the classrooms is by means of 20 stone steps which are a continuous hazard so the school cannot enrol a child with a physical disability because these steps are slippery in wet weather. The toilet facilities in the main building are insufficient for the number of pupils &ndash; there are only two toilets for the girls and one cubicle and a number of urinals for the boys. Male and female staff must use the same toilets as the children. There is no water connection to the classrooms and the only water, aside from the toilets, is in the small kitchen area which is used as a classroom by the learning support teacher. The school does not have a staff room, staff toilet or office. The secretary works from a stage area in the senior classroom. There is no room in which parents may meet teachers. Infant classes are held in a portakabin at the rear of the building. This classroom is separated from the rest of the school. The toilets are outside, so pupils have to leave the building to go to the toilet and are unsupervised during this time.</P>
    <P>The site is an historic heritage site and attracts a large number of tourists all year round but, in particular, between April and October. Tourists wander around during the day and have access to some of the areas where the children assemble, despite efforts on the part of the school to restrict entry. There is a risk from extra car traffic at the area around the entrance to the school and, despite direction signs, some tourists attempt to use the portaloos which are used by the infant pupils. When tourists enter the cloister area <Col N="166" />which is under part of the school building they can be heard from the classroom. The school is in close proximity to the tidal area of the River Maigue and there is an on-going problem with rats and the school authorities have to lay rat poison to protect it from them. As the sewage system is old, there are on-going problems, especially in wet weather when the sewage backs up and oozes through some of the manholes in the playground. This area had to be closed off twice in the past school year until it was cleaned up.</P>
    <P>As is clear, the school has serious problems. I visited the school during the summer and spoke with the chairman of the board of management, Reverend Rachel Lewis to whom I pay tribute as well as the principal, Margaret Beckinden, her staff and all involved. There is urgent need for a new school in the area. It is three miles from where I live so I know the area, the school and its concerns intimately. I ask the Minister to respond positively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this issue this evening because it gives the Department an opportunity to highlight the current position regarding the application for a new school for St. Nicholas primary school. At present, St. Nicholas primary school has a staffing level of a principal, two mainstream class teachers and a shared learning support teacher, not school based. The enrolment at 30 September 2002 was 71. The school's facilities consist of two classrooms, a portakabin for the third teacher and a portakabin for the resource and remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The Department has an extensive primary school building programme under way at present and this includes a large number of projects at various stages of architectural planning, details of which are available on our Department's website at www.education.ie. Decisions on additional projects proceeding to architectural planning are taken in the light of the annual allocation for capital projects, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects. The programme for 2002 is in place and the schools concerned have been notified.</P>
      <P>Later this year, when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, will be framing a further comprehensive programme of works. This will involve putting more projects into architectural planning. The needs of St. Nicholas primary school will be considered at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the school's board of management should ensure that essential health and safety issues at the school are attended to. They should therefore continue to use the devolved grant for minor works and if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, they may <Col N="167" />apply to the Department's building unit for grant aid.</P>
    <P>The Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Nicholas primary school. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to raise this issue. Some Deputies raised it in the Dáil already but I am glad of the opportunity to broaden our concerns. We are concerned about what is apparently a continuing closure, section by section, of all Iarnród Éireann's freight line business. It is being done under the current Government and was done during its last term of office.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann, if asked, will say that no lines have been closed and that everything is much the same. The reality, however, is clear. Even in the past 12 to 18 months the Kingscourt line has closed and the Ennis to Claremorris and the western rail freight line have seen no business. The Foynes to Limerick line has also closed to business and there is no freight business on several other lines.</P>
      <P>There is deep concern following the closure of IFI. Following the review that Irish rail management is undertaking on the freight business it seems it is now looking at closing the North Wall depot in the centre of Dublin for general freight business. There will also be a discontinuation of line or freight traffic in Cork, Mallow and Tralee stations and the Limerick to Waterford freight line business will also be closed.</P>
      <P>The problem is that this closure by stealth or by section is killing the possibility of freight line business and it threatens the whole rail network. A railway system needs a large volume of traffic if it is to work as there is such a heavy fixed cost involved while the marginal cost is relatively low. If we remove most of the train services on the lines, the viability of other freight lines and of passenger services come into question.</P>
      <P>Any report on the matter will find that the reason so much is being invested in road haulage systems is that 90% of freight now goes by road. One of the reasons for that is the flexibility that road haulage brings, but another reason is the lack of investment and lack of faith in the service over the past 30 years. Not only has this Government but others over the years have failed in this area. I argue, however, that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have shown particular disfavour to rail transport systems. They have not invested over the years and it is not surprising that we now have a situation where the usage of freight transport and of rail transport in general, compared to road based systems, is very low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan, which was trumpeted by the former Minister for Public Enterprise, now Senator O'Rourke, predicted a whole new era for rail. The reality is that we are <Col N="168" />witnessing continual closure and reduction in the rail service. The Fianna Fáil election manifesto listed a number of rail crossings that were upgraded or signalling systems that improved safety on some of the lines from Dublin. There was, in reality, no strategic vision for how the rail network is developed. Now four years after the national development plan was negotiated and agreed the Minister is talking about getting a strategic rail plan in place. That is a sign of lack of vision for rail-based transport.</P>
    <P>It is urgent that the Minister clarifies his position on this issue. The Government does not want Iarnród Éireann management to fund a rail-based freight system. Iarnród Éireann believes that funding will not be available. The Minister will wash his hands and say it has nothing to do with him but that the board of Iarnród Éireann must decide. Ultimately, the Government is the shareholder and it has the ability to say whether it wants the country to follow the policy set out in the European White Paper on Transport which promotes a return to rail-based freight transport systems.</P>
    <P>I am keen to hear the Minister's view on the possible closure of the North Wall freight handling yard, his view on the possible closure of the Cork, Mallow and Thurles freight services and on the Limerick to Waterford freight services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As was indicated on the Adjournment debate last night, the Minister understands that the management of Iarnród Éireann is carrying out a review of the implications for its rail freight business of the loss of revenue associated with the closure of IFI. The closure of IFI, which was the third largest customer of freight services from Iarnród Éireann, has resulted in serious loss of business and revenue. The current review of rail freight is the normal business response, which could be expected from a commercial organisation responding to the loss of a major customer. This is against a background where it is projected that rail freight will lose approximately &euro;14 million in the current year, with the company as a whole incurring an overall deficit, after subvention, estimated at approximately &euro;25 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister is seriously concerned about the current trading position of Iarnród Éireann, in particular given the significant subvention received by the company &ndash; in excess of &euro;150 million in the current year &ndash; and the increases in State support over recent years. He has received proposals for significant fare increases from Iarnród Éireann and the CIE bus companies in response to their deteriorating financial position. The Minister is considering these applications in the context of the need for reform within public transport generally and he hopes to be in a position shortly to respond to those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister understands that Iarnród Éireann is examining all the major loss-making areas of its business with a view to rectifying its serious <Col N="169" />financial position but he is informed that the board of CIE has not yet reached any final conclusions in this regard. In addition the strategic rail review, currently under way, will examine the long-term rail requirements for the country as a whole in the light of the emerging spatial planning and regional development policies and local land use and transportation studies.</P>
    <P>This review encompasses both rail freight and passenger services and will cover urban commuter and inter-regional services. The future of rail freight needs to be considered in the context of sustainable economic policies and the commercial viability of rail freight operations. The review is due to be completed by the end of this year. Therefore, the Minister expects decisions on the future of rail freight to be taken in the context of the strategic rail review in the long-term national economic interest and the interest of Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <P>The people of Lixnaw were disappointed last week when they heard of the transfer of Sergeant Neilius O'Sullivan from the village. This leaves one garda to police a large district. Sergeant O'Sullivan was transferred to Lixnaw in 1995 and immediately established a strong rapport with the local community, especially young people. He is highly regarded and respected by everyone. He is the chairman of the local community centre committee which provides activities for young people, including indoor soccer, basketball and other games, while also providing facilities for the St. Vincent de Paul which places special emphasis on care of the elderly. Sergeant O'Sullivan is also chairman of the community alert scheme, a selector on the Lixnaw under-21 hurling team which won the county championship last Sunday week, and he coaches a large number of youth basketball teams.</P>
      <P>Before he came to the village there was concern about the level of juvenile delinquency and petty crime in the village. However, because of his involvement with young people in the village and his friendly relations with them, Lixnaw is one of the most peaceful villages in Ireland. The elderly feel secure in their homes and juvenile crime and vandalism are almost non-existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when Lixnaw village is about to grow substantially with planning permission obtained or granted for more than 200 houses, surely the decision to transfer Sergeant O'Sullivan is a retrograde step. The decision to do so without replacing him appears to be in contradiction of the commitment given in the Fianna Fáil manifesto before the previous general election and in the programme for Government to community <Col N="170" />policing and the presence of gardaí in communities.</P>
    <P>Over the years Lixnaw has lost its secondary school, creamery, railway station and school for special children and now the local people believe their Garda station is under threat. Their concern at losing it is because it is important for their security. If gardaí are needed in other districts, the Minister should direct the Commissioner to provide them. Lixnaw village cannot be penalised because of the shortage of gardaí in places, such as Tralee, which need them. I appeal to the Minister of State to convey my concerns to her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and to appeal to him to make the necessary representations to the Commissioner to ensure the sergeant is left in place.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me this opportunity. I wish to speak about the proposed reduction in personnel in the Garda station in Lixnaw, County Kerry. It had a larger Garda station many years ago and, as a result of the great efforts by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, the village still has a small barracks.</P>
      <P>In 1998 under the Garda building programme a number of projects were completed, including a new station at Lixnaw which is a fine example of the type of building which will serve the force into this millennium. Garda facilities have also been significantly improved through a systematic programme of refurbishment of Garda stations. A sum of &euro;22.6 million was allocated for capital projects in 2000 in addition to &euro;8.6 million for maintenance. In County Kerry, along with Lixnaw, Garda stations in south Kerry in Ballinskelligs, Kenmare, Sneem and Waterville have also benefited from this programme.</P>
      <P>The increased strength of the Garda is reflected in the numbers assigned to County Kerry. In 1997 the number stood at 233. In March 2001, 251 gardaí were working to combat crime in the county, an increase of some 8%.</P>
      <P>The proposed reduction in the Garda presence in Lixnaw is an important issue for the people in north Kerry. If the village loses a garda, Garda presence there will be reduced from two to one. Two gardaí are needed there and should be kept there. It is what the people are entitled to. Why are the people of Lixnaw being deprived? I am aware of the problems of rural areas because I am from such an area. The <i>status quo</i> should be maintained in the village.</P>
      <P>Lixnaw serves one of the largest parishes in County Kerry and the population is increasing. A new county council housing estate of 60 houses will be built there with eight beginning soon. I understand a private development is in the pipeline. This suggests the area is growing. Will it be the norm throughout the country for growing areas to have their Garda presence reduced? I understood we were going to increase Garda numbers in areas rather than reduce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" />The village is under a great deal of pressure to survive but the Government has shown its commitment to the people of Lixnaw before. I will do everything within my power as Fianna Fáil TD for Kerry North to preserve and maintain all public resources in Lixnaw.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I welcome this opportunity to set out for the benefit of the House the current staffing arrangements of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Minister is responsible for the overall provision of resources to the Garda. He will continue to ensure that the force has adequate resources to tackle crime. The Government has substantially increased the number of gardaí in recent years from 10,800 in 1997 to a current strength of approximately 11,860 members, and this is set to increase in the near future to 12,200 &ndash; an historic high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will also be aware that the agreed programme for Government provides for a further increase in the strength of the force of 2,000, and this will be done within the resources <Col N="172" />available. The Government has also increased the approved number of members at sergeant rank which has risen from 1,868 in 1997 to the current figure of 1,971, an increase of more than 100.</P>
    <P>Regarding the specific matter at hand, the House will appreciate that the Commissioner is vested under section 8 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, with the general direction and control of the force, and the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter in the first instance for the Garda authorities. It would not be appropriate for the Minister to get involved in the day to day management of the force.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the sergeant at Lixnaw Garda station is due to transfer to Ardfert Garda station on 24 October 2002. The Minister understands that this is a distance of less than ten miles. The Minister has further been informed that the transfer is a Garda operational matter taking into consideration the overall policing needs of the Listowel district.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 October 2002.</P>
