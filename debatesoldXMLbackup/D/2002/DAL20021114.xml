      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of topics under Standing Order 31 dealing with five different issues. I propose to deal with them separately and I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I have received notice from Deputy Gogarty and I call on him to state the matter.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gogarty is not in the House we will move on to the second topic. I have received notice from Deputy Michael D. Higgins and I call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise the following matter: the urgent need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to apologise on behalf of the State to Carolyn Swift for the disgraceful action of the police against the Pike Theatre on the occasion of its production of the &ldquo;Rose Tattoo&rdquo; in May 1957. Will the Minister acknowledge the impact this action by the police and the State had on the members of this small and courageous theatre? Will he now, as a gesture of goodwill, make such reparation as is appropriate to the surviving member of the company, the lives of whose members were irrevocably damaged by the actions taken in the name of the State.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 on a matter of national importance: the discovery by the EPA of <Col N="610" />levels of uranium 238 in the public water supply in Baltinglass, County Wicklow; the fact that there are no parametric values for uranium 238 in either national or EU drinking water regulations and there are no such values in the new regulations which will come into place in 2004; the consequences of this and what measures the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Health and Children propose to take to address the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is agreed that I am sharing time with members of the Technical Group.</P>
      <P>Following on from my earlier comments on the Bill, I wish to reinforce my party's sense of the importance of the marine sector and its potential and, consequently, the importance of this Bill to protect our marine resources. There has been a failure in this country for many years to realise the resource we have. The marine potential has not been developed in various forms of aquaculture, energy resources of a wind, wave or tidal nature, tourism possibilities and fishing resources. It would appear from current developments at EU level that we have misused those resources and are now facing a bleak situation. However, that can be turned around if we look to the sea to a much greater extent as a source of our livelihood, wealth and resources. That underlines the importance of this Bill in protecting our marine resources.</P>
      <P>The key issue is how we enforce the provisions of the Bill. I have not heard any disagreement with its contents. I wish to raise three topics which I regard as pertinent. The three main recommendations of the recent study on the need for a marine tug vessel have not been implemented yet. There is a strong case for placing a significant tug vessel on the western seaboard, probably in the Shannon area. On the eastern seaboard, it probably makes sense for us to work with Britain in terms of common coverage. Other speakers have referred to the dangers from shipments of MOX nuclear fuels through the Irish Sea. Apart from simply standing on the shore and shouting abuse across the Irish Sea, we need to take positive measures to show we are serious about protecting our environment. It is instructive to note the recent incident off the coast of Scotland, where a nuclear submarine ran aground and could have had dramatic effects.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a proper vessel mapping service in Irish waters is important. I urge the Minister to proceed at full haste with such a system for the benefit of shipping and fishery protection. It would also signify that this country is serious about its responsibilities in relation to the marine. The third recommendation related to the protection of the Donegal and Galway coasts, because of their special ecosystem, by creating an exclusion zone. I understand that was turned down by the international marine institutions. However, the Government should go back and fight our case again as those areas are an important tourism resource. A chemical or oil spill or other such incident on our coastline would have serious consequences for tourism, which is one of our biggest industries. Visitors to Ireland are particularly attracted to our coastline, much as some of my colleagues from the midlands might like to take them there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Government to act quickly on those three recommendations. We cannot say we are taking our marine industry and its potential seriously unless we resource our coastguard prop<Col N="623" />erly and unless we have the proper co-ordination at our ports to manage spills and leaks. I realise there have been some good developments, such as investment in a sea-bed survey and the development of the coastguard, but that should be extended further. Thirty or 40 years from now a huge proportion of the wealth of this country will come from our relationship with the sea. On a 50 year timescale, investment in facilities such as a marine tug vessel, coupled with legislation such as this Bill, is the right approach. While the Minister may have to convince the Minister for Finance of the justification for expenditure on a tug vessel, the long-term economic and social argument for investing in the protection of the marine is irrefutable. The key indicator of how the Department performs is how it resources the protection of the marine and how we invest in new marine services and industries. I welcome the Bill and the chance to raise those brief points again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND" hpid="Dr. Twomey Dr. Twomey">

      <P>I am delighted to see Deputy Browne in the House. He is a fellow Deputy from County Wexford and a man who is well aware of the feelings of fishermen in the county towards a number of issues, especially now that we face a serious problem with the EU and our territorial waters. Deputy Browne would also be aware of recent pollution problems in the estuary off Waterford Port.</P>
      <P>Bills like this are important. Any legislation which improves the environment, both on land and at sea, is welcome. The Bill covers certain aspects of this agenda. If it helps to improve world-wide awareness of our environment it is even more important. Unfortunately, a Bill enacted into law is of no use unless it is enforceable and transparent. Any Bill to improve the environment, including this one, should be enforceable.</P>
      <P>We have a huge pharmaceutical industry. It is interesting to note that three drugs in the news headlines, Seroxat which was the subject of a recent &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme, Lipitor which was highlighted for its positive benefits for heart disease and Viagra, which is self-explanatory, are all manufactured in Ireland. All of these drugs are made from raw chemical ingredients which are shipped into the country in massive amounts. They are transported on the seas surrounding our island and are entering and leaving our ports every day. The combined resources of the Garda, EPA and the local authorities cannot prevent the massive illegal dumping of recent years. We have much legislation on this matter also but we seem to have become reactive rather that proactive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to look at how we are going to enforce this Bill. For the purpose of the Act an inspector can stop and board any ship and examine it. A member of the Garda or a navy officer could be described as an inspector but have they the resources to police our waters to prevent sea pollution under the Bill? We must consider the <Col N="624" />future role of the navy if we hope to provide any meaningful role, not only under this Bill, but also in terms of acts at sea and proper fishery protection. It is incumbent on the State to enforce the Bill on any ship which enters our territorial waters, ports or offshore facilities.</P>
    <P>Trade nowadays is international as is financial insurance. It will be difficult to police this section also. The ships which enter our ports may have insurance from their own state. It will be difficult to know if this is enforceable.</P>
    <P>We should be looking beyond the liability and compensation aspects of the Bill to how to police aspects of our environment, especially our seas. The Bill has quite specific provisions for compensation when accidents happen but we have few resources to police our waters at present. The Naval Service is barely able to keep up with illegal fishing. What changes will occur to make even part of the Bill enforceable? </P>
    <P>The Government should fight for our rights to our territorial waters in their dealings with the EU. We should not give up our fishing rights because the Spanish and French fishermen have denuded their waters of fish. We should not give them an opportunity to do the same to our waters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this debate. For the first time legislation on this issue is being added to the Statute Book. It is important that the international convention is signed by as many states as possible. The passage of legislation is often slow and cumbersome but it is disappointing that only 12 states have signed the convention six years after it was initially negotiated. Only two have brought empowering legislation into force. There is the added problem that we are effectively putting the convention into a legal code which we did not negotiate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many good aspects to this convention and it is much needed. However, Sinn Féin has concerns which I am sure will be shared by many others. The Irish Sea and St. George's Channel are busy waterways, not just for Irish but for international shipping traffic. British Nuclear Fuels proposes to transport across these waters spent and reprocessed fuel rods, not just from the MOX plant, but also from the THORP plant. If these plants ever came to operate anything near the capacity planned by British Nuclear Fuels there would be a huge increase in the amount of dangerous traffic in Irish territorial waters. An accident off the coast of France could have a large negative impact on the Irish coastline, so the impact of one in the Irish Sea would be enormous. In this context I ask if the amounts of financial compensation are realistic. It is envisaged in the convention that ship owners would be liable for only the first St£100 million and after that compensation would be paid from the hazardous noxious substances fund, up to St£250 million. Given that the convention was signed up to in 1996, are the fiscal amount of compensation <Col N="625" />still adequate to cover any conceivable pollution disasters?</P>
    <P>It is clear that the convention was negotiated with oil and gas products in mind as most international maritime accidents involve spillages of crude oil and other petroleum products. Our concern is with these potential hazards and the obvious danger posed by nuclear traffic in and out of the Sellafield facility.</P>
    <P>The Bill excludes certain types of nuclear activity. This seems strange, either material is hazardous or it is not. Warships and navy and government vessels are excluded from the convention. This is of particular concern to Irish citizens as it is well known that British, NATO and even Russian submarines regularly travel through Irish waters. The scale of unaccountable trawler sinkings in recent years is a testament to the nature of activities and dangers which these vessels pose to commercial shipping. However, the Bill imposes no conditions or liabilities on these vessels which are powered by nuclear reactors and which often carry nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>This Bill is also reactive in that it sets out what must be done in the aftermath of an accident. The International Maritime Organisation, a UN agency with responsibility for safety of shipping and the prevention of maritime pollution, has a protocol on preparedness, response and co-operation on pollution incidents. Why is it not included in the Bill? It would enshrine into law a positive obligation not just to respond to emergencies, but to make sure that they never happen if proper procedures are in place. Does it apply to naval vessels excluded from liability under the convention? </P>
    <P>The Bill allows for the appointment of inspectors with the powers to board and detain ships. Will the Naval Service carry our this work? Has it the capacity, given its vital fisheries protection and drug detection tasks, to take on this extra work? The Bill claims that there would be no additional Exchequer cost incurred in its passing. We do not ask that it be held up but has the extra workload on the navy or other state bodies been properly thought out? If the policing of the Act when it comes into force is going to be without cost, is there a mysterious team of little green volunteers who will not need funding or payment to sustain homes, etc.? Even if these free, voluntary personnel are available to police the Act how will they get out to visit the ships which are in our territorial waters but not coming into our ports? It is not feasible to suggest that we can swim out to large tankers, or approach them on surfboards. I anticipate that we will put down some amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage and I look forward to further discussion of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is important that the raft of legislation introduced by the Government to deal with issues like pollution and safety at sea is strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent County Cork which, along with County Kerry, has a sad history of pollution and <Col N="626" />abandoned shipwrecks. The <i>Ranga</i> was washed up off the Kerry coast near Slea Head more than 20 years ago. The <i>Bardini Reefer</i> was abandoned and scuttled in the channel between Bear Island and the Beara Peninsula. It remains in the channel and is to the detriment to fishing. Will the Minister tell the House if this wreck will be broken up and removed from the channel? It has been a matter of concern to fishermen and the people of Bear Island for almost 20 years. The infamous iron ore carrier <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> was a massive tanker that came into Bantry Bay for shelter in the 1980s. The 12-man crew was airlifted off in stormy conditions and the rudderless ship eventually hit the Stags Rocks off the coast of west Cork. It sank in rich spawning grounds for herring and remains there to this day. It will probably still be there long after I have passed away.</P>
    <P>The <i>Tribulus</i> was another oil tanker that came into Bantry Bay for shelter after it was holed and stayed for three or four months. Luckily enough, the company concerned was viable and repaired the tanker after some weeks. The vessel was eventually removed without having done too much damage, although there was some pollution. In fairness, compensation was paid to Cork County Council at that time for the cost of cleaning up the mess. Without wishing to seem parochial, the greatest oil spills off our coastline occurred in Bantry Bay in the 1970s when a tanker leaked and, later, when a substandard valve in the oil terminal caused huge amounts of oil to spill. It took many months to clean up after the latter incident. I am sure these two spills would rank among the ten most serious oil spills in world history. I refer to these accidents to highlight the vulnerability of the south-west coast. If we analyse the shipping lanes from South and Central America to Europe, we will find that the busiest lanes pass by the Fastnet Rock. There is a huge level of activity along the south-west coast.</P>
    <P>I wonder if this or any Bill can deal with problems such as those which developed after the incident involving the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> which nobody seemed to own. If the vessel had missed the Stags Rocks that night, it would probably have run aground at Ardmore. It would be still resting there, although it may have broken up in that location. Similar difficulties arose when the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> was scuttled. Is legislation in place to prevent similar occurrences or to enable us to clear up the mess after such shipwrecks? This is a matter of critical importance.</P>
    <P>I will emphasise a point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan regarding the provision of an emergency towing vessel, or ETV, as recommended following the Irish emergency towing vessel study three or four years ago. I feel strongly that a new ETV should be provided. The report, commissioned by the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, said that the primary role of an ETV would be to provide a towing service to minimise oil pollution off the Irish coastline resulting from stranded vessels. The study's <Col N="627" />objectives included analysing vessel traffic within the Irish pollution responsibility zone, or IRPZ, which is of critical importance. It also determined the commercial and environmental resources at greatest risk from pollution associated with maritime activities and investigated the State's legal position regarding liability and jurisdiction pertinent to maritime pollution within the IPRZ. It examined the capabilities of ETVs and the design specifications required for operation within the IPRZ.</P>
    <P>Importantly, the study attempted to determine the optimum location for ETV deployment to minimise the identified risks. In this regard, it is crucial that we seriously consider locating the ETV vessel in a place like Bantry Bay. A previous speaker mentioned the Shannon Estuary in this context, but three or four tug boats operate in the estuary as a consequence of the volume of maritime traffic there. Some of the tug boats are ocean-going and are therefore capable of covering the west coast. Given that there is a revamped oil storage depot at Whiddy Island, Bantry Bay can play a pivotal role in protecting the entire south-west coast. It is intended to significantly increase the volume of traffic to the Whiddy Island terminal, which holds our national reserve of crude oil, bunker oil, diesel and similar noxious, dangerous and potentially polluting products. It makes sense to locate an ETV vessel in Bantry Bay in the event of increased traffic in the region. Bantry Bay is 16 miles deep and seven miles wide and has harboured the largest ships in the world. The ETV could play a dual role; it could be seconded for use at the terminal and it could protect the south-west coastline. My suggestion deserves serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Regardless of where the ETV is located, it is vital that we obtain an ocean-going tug vessel to act in times of emergency, such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident. An ETV could have safely shepherded the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> to sea. We need to protect our coastline from the potential dangers of huge ore carriers, bulk tankers and other vessels. I urge the Minister, therefore, to put in place an ETV as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome yesterday's establishment of a Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The committee will have huge significance in the area of marine legislation and will discuss marine issues. I have felt strongly for some time about the level of importance given to marine issues at committee level and I raised the matter at a meeting of my parliamentary party two years ago. It seemed as if 95% of the time of the former Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine was spent discussing agricultural matters and only 5% of our time was given to marine affairs. I am glad the chairman of the new committee has made clear that significant time will be provided to debate marine issues. I welcome the fact that representatives of a number of organisations will attend next week's meeting of <Col N="628" />the committee to discuss a number of matters, particularly the protection of the Irish box.</P>
    <P>This is a significant Bill in the context of a plethora of legislation in the past ten years aimed at protecting our coastline and enhancing the safety of our regions. Some say that the Mayo and Donegal coastline is of particular eco significance, but all our coastline, including Wexford, Cork or Kerry, is of great significance to our tourism industry and must be protected at all times. The Bill when enacted will form a solid line of defence as far as our coastline is concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. In addition to the other legislation introduced by the outgoing Government since 1997, this Bill is very significant and appropriate. A huge raft of work has been done by the Irish Marine Rescue Service in regard to safety at sea for vessels up and down the coastline. The enactment of this legislation will help to copperfasten the safety of our waters which must be protected. I understand separate legislation to deal with the transportation of nuclear waste from the MOX plant and so on will be introduced. I hope this legislation will be introduced as soon as possible. A Deputy asked why was that aspect not included in this Bill or is it of such importance that it needs legislation of its own? I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

Is rud tábhachtach é ó thaobh timpeallachta de. Má tharlóidh timpiste leis an ábhar sin, ní mbeimid fiú ábalta iascaireacht ná rud ar bith eile i Muir Éireann go ceann na mílte bliana. Ba cheart go mbeadh an Rialtas sásta leasú a chur sa Bhille sula mbeidh sé críochnaithe sna Tithe agus agus go mbeadh sé sásta an ghníomh sin faoi connadh MOX a dhéanamh. Níl rud ar bith againn muna bhfuil an timpeallacht againn, muna a bhfuil sé sláintiúl, ní amháin in Éirinn ach i Sasana, fósta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important Bill. The last point made by Deputy O'Donovan is very important. By the time the Bill has gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas, we should be able to deal expeditiously with the movement of ships carrying MOX fuels and other nuclear fuels up and down the Irish Sea. At 4.15 p.m. last Thursday, Deputy Gay Mitchell raised in the House the question of HMS <i>Trafalgar,</i> the British nuclear submarine which went aground off the Isle of Skye. Thankfully, there were no serious injuries and, more importantly, there was no leak of radioactive material into the sea. Apparently the British submarine was on a military exercise and the English media, including Sky News and ITN, reported at the time that a trainee was in charge, which is utterly shameful. At the very least the Government must insist on the British Government that when its ships, particularly nuclear submarines &ndash; obviously they would travel in English rather than Irish waters &ndash; travel in international <Col N="629" />waters, first, they would not be armed and would not carry nuclear material and, second, a competent and qualified crew would be in charge. I am not sure what notification we get of these movements. There would be nothing more explosive than an accident such as the one that occurred off the Isle of Skye.</P>
    <P>The biggest threat to our seas is nuclear material. The Irish Sea is deemed to be the most radioactive sea in the world. This is the case because British Nuclear Fuels Limited has continued for many decades to pump into the Irish Sea low level radioactive waste. An idea is currently being canvassed which the Government must oppose &ndash; it was canvassed at a conference I recently attended. The theory is that because of our concerns in Ireland for the way liquid waste at Sellafield is stored on site, a potential deal is being spoken about. The deal would be that British Nuclear Fuels Limited would increase the rate with which it vitrifies the liquid waste stored on site and reduce the timescale, which is currently around 2015, by a number of years. This would obviously mean there would be a reduced risk of an accident on site at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The <i>quid pro quo</i> would be that they would increase their discharges of technetium 99 into the Irish Sea, which is not an acceptable solution to the problem. If discharges of radioactive material into the Irish Sea are increased, no matter how low or what the experts tell us, the Irish Sea, in particular Irish shell fish, would be polluted by hundreds of times greater amounts of technetium 99. While we are told this substance will not kill, it certainly will not cure one. The Government must be much more assertive and aggressive with the British Government in regard to pollution of the Irish Sea with hazardous and dangerous substances. There can be nothing more hazardous or dangerous than radioactive material which lasts for hundreds or perhaps thousands of years.</P>
    <P>Another equally important issue is the change in the world since 11 September last year. Prior to that date, the American destroyer, <i>USS Cole,</i> was attacked by al-Qaeda in the Middle East and 17 men on board died as a result of the incident. It took approximately 14 months to repair the ship so that it could sail again. We paid a lot of attention to the incident at the time but after 11 September insufficient attention has been paid, particularly by the British Government, to the transportation of MOX fuel up and down the Irish Sea. There was an infamous shipment of shame for British Nuclear Fuels Limited when the fuel it falsified and sent to Japan recently had to return through the Irish Sea. It said that armed police and so on were on board that ship. I believe, however, that the ship was not protected by military escort or warships.</P>
    <P>Any MOX fuel cargo being transported up and down the Irish Sea should at the very least have either military or naval ships in attendance to ensure there is not an event like that of the <i>USS Cole</i> or what happened last month in the Middle <Col N="630" />East when a massive petrol tanker was blown up by al-Qaeda.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about these incidents and the lack of action on the part of the British Government. It has a laid back <i>laissez faire</i> attitude to the transport of dangerous goods on the Irish Sea. It is incumbent on the Government, in the full and certain knowledge shared by all of us of the danger posed by al-Qaeda to shipping all over the world, that it ensures the most potentially hazardous substance of all should not be allowed to travel up and down the Irish sea. I was not happy with the response of the Government and the Department of Defence, which runs the Naval Service, during the controversy over the MOX shipments. We should have had, at the very least, visible monitoring of the flotilla of ships. The Government said it was monitoring the transport, but there was no physical presence on the Irish sea. It does not have to be threatening: we should show by our presence on the sea at these times how we feel about this transport. I ask the Government what the British would be doing if the situation was reversed and the plant was in Ireland. They would be doing a lot more than this Government has done.</P>
    <P>The question of security of ships, particularly passenger ships, has been in the foreground since the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, spoke this week about the real and present danger that exists. There have been reports that al-Qaeda is prepared to bring a lorry laden with explosives on board a ferry and blow it up in the middle of the sea. I would like to know what action this Government is taking to prevent such an incident on ships coming to and from Ireland. The transport of noxious substances that we know about is one thing, but the attempted carrying of unknown substances is something to which we must give serious consideration. I would like the Minister in his reply to give a commitment, without going into detail, that all ferries leaving or coming into this country will be obliged to pass the most stringent and rigorous security test possible in order to determine whether any of the heavily-laden lorries and containers are carrying explosive substances.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on this matter but there are experts in this field. What is the Government doing about it? It is a real and present threat and one for which we have been told we must prepare. We should not assume that al-Qaeda will not target Irish ships or goods transports or, God forbid, our cities or countryside. We must be alert to the dangers and should not underestimate the abilities of these people who do not fear losing their lives.</P>
    <P>The Irish sea is the most radioactive in the world. In the context of this Bill and of the damage done to our environment and to our fish, particularly our shellfish, what action will the Government take to effect a reduction, if possible, in discharges of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea? What would happen if a tragic event caused pollution of our sea for hundreds of years? How <Col N="631" />does this Bill deal with compensation? We are talking about limitless damage, something we could not even contemplate, which worries me. Our marine industry could be destroyed. Already, the fishing industry is suffering. If I go to Kerry or the west on my holidays and tell people I am from County Louth, they ask whether I eat the fish there. Medical experts tell us there is no reason not to eat the fish, but people are still concerned. If there was a spectacular and tragic event, as al-Qaeda wants, how would we deal with it? It is a very important question which I hope the Minister will answer in his reply.</P>
    <P>The other issues pale into insignificance compared with these. I welcome the good points in this Bill, although there are gaps, especially in the Government's plans for dealing with the incidents I mentioned. We must always act to protect our environment and this is the most important aspect of the Bill. People who pollute our environment will be made to pay dearly and that is to be welcomed.

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of saying a few words on this Bill. As I come from a county with a coastline of 300 miles, the Bill is of particular importance to me. As someone who spends some time on the Kerry coastline, especially on beaches such as Ballybunion and Banna, I am only too aware of the threat posed by pollution to these and to the whole coastline as well as to marine life. There are about 100 species of fish off the coast of Kerry. It is one of our greatest resources, although it has not been exploited. As a nation we have not fully capitalised on it. The coastline is also very suitable for marine activities such as surfing &ndash; some of the best surfing waters in Europe are in places like the Maharees &ndash; as well as canoeing, sailing and so on. This Bill has particular relevance because it is so important to protect our coastline and the waters off the coast and because Ireland has about 16% of European waters.</P>
      <P>I often marvel at the level of sea pollution. I am not just talking about oil pollution, with the occasional slick being deposited on the beach. If one walks along Ballybunion beach after high tide one sees material which is obviously not native to north Kerry deposited along the shore. It comes mostly from fishing vessels and others using the Shannon estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those in charge of ships, of the captain and the crew, should be more responsible. An attitude prevails that if one dumps material at sea it will <Col N="632" />not end up onshore, but that is not always the case. Indiscriminate dumping of material from vessels using our waters should be examined and discouraged. The types of materials that come ashore are not materials used locally. They are not waste materials typically found in Kerry; they have come ashore having been dumped from ships using our waters.</P>
    <P>Given that the Shannon Estuary is one of our biggest estuaries, that oil and other materials are transported up the estuary, especially to Tarbert power station, Aughinish Island and Shannon Airport, the estuary is a busy waterway having regard to the major demand placed on it by various industries. That is why I expressed concern in this regard in Kerry County Council in the past, but it is powerless to do anything about this other than to clean up pollution when there is an incidence of oil pollution. Our waters and tourism industry are always under threat from an incidence of oil pollution. For example, there are various resorts on the Clare and Kerry sides of the Shannon Estuary. There are golf courses which have been recently developed and golf courses such as Ballybunion and Barrow. There is also the marine life and the vast potential of our waters that is underexploited and undercapitalised.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I am delighted to welcome the Bill. I hope it will have full effect and will act as a disincentive to sheepowners to be the source and cause of sea pollution. The Minister might refer to other forms of pollution from vessels that use our waters. What deterrents exist to prevent sea pollution? What type of monitoring is in place to prevent an irresponsible attitude to the offloading of hazardous materials from vessels using our waters?</P>
    <P>The cleaning out of oil and other vessels is another practice that took place in the Shannon Estuary. Sea water was used to rinse out tankers whereby they would dip into the sea and, on re-emerging, release the sea water which would then be polluted. What provisions are in place to prevent that practice? Is that practice of using sea water to wash out tankers that would have deposited their loads along the Shannon Estuary, in Shannon Airport, Foynes or Tarbert illegal?</P>
    <P>Do the provisions of this Bill relate to coal pollution in the same way as to pollution from oil and other substances, given that there are also major shipments of coal up the Shannon Estuary to service Moneypoint? I am sure they do, but I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify that point. For example, on one occasion 240,000 tonnes of coal was carried on the <i>Bargemaster</i>&ndash; one of the biggest ships in the world &ndash; up the Shannon Estuary some years ago. If there had been an accident at sea on that occasion, who would have been responsible? Will the provisions of this Bill cover an accident at sea in the case of large coal carriers?</P>
    <P>For the reasons I outlined and given that I live in a maritime county with 300 miles of coastline and the fact that we have such an important <Col N="633" />resource underdeveloped, unexploited and undercapitalised, this is important legislation. There is also the broader question of the development of our waterways, which does not relate to this Bill. This Bill protects our waters for the future. If our waters remain clean and unpolluted, that will provide us with an opportunity to develop this resource. As agriculture is declining, the sea and the possibilities it affords us to obtain food from different sources will become more attractive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to speak on this Bill because I, too, live along the west coast. Our coastline is extremely important, given that we do not have the necessary infrastructure or industry. We must protect our coastline at all costs. All of us will recall terrible incidents of oil pollution from tankers. Massive oil tankers, which carry as much oil as possible in order to make the maximum profit, travel around our coast. As in the case of aeroplanes in our airspace, we do not see them, but they are off our coast. If shortcuts are taken and perchance something goes wrong, we are the ones who will pay the price, and a terrible price we will pay. This Bill is eminently suitable for the Ireland of today. It is more than that, it is a necessity. The Bill addresses a critical matter that needs to be resolved sooner rather than later. That matter needs to be addressed and that is why I welcome the Bill and greatly support it.</P>
      <P>The Bill is essential for today because we are endeavouring to carry out our collective responsibility as a modern nation in a global village which is getting smaller by the day. The world is often described as a big pond, which it is, but like a big pond if things go wrong, every organism in the pond feels the knock-on effect. We are like soap on a rope. We are at the end or in the middle of the global village, depending on how one looks at it. It behoves us to do our own housekeeping. We have a responsibility to ourselves, to everybody who depends on the sea and to future generations to keep our part of the house in order in terms of the larger scale of things. We are endeavouring to carry out our collective responsibility and to play our part in protecting ourselves and our environment from the hazards that exist and greatly threaten our modern world.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that we are under great threat. There is not a day goes by that we do not hear of some terrible incident that reminds us of our vulnerability. We are in a precarious situation.</P>
      <P>As stated on &ldquo;Seascapes&rdquo; every week, we are an island nation and depend on the sea all around us. We are prone to the effect of any calamity that occurs at sea. We are sitting between the rest of Europe and the Americas. We will experience the impact of any problems passing vessels may have, which poses a major threat to our coastline. If the cargo such vessels carry becomes dislodged, we will suffer the impact of such pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" />Our fishing industry is important to us, as is our tourism industry. The west depends especially on the fishing industry. Any oil spillage could severely penalise activities in the west and paralyse everything that happens along the west coast in particular. The coasts of Donegal, Mayo and Galway have been identified as high risk marine environmental areas. Who can forget the pollution caused by the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> tanker which was grounded off France in 1978? It spilled over 220,000 tonnes of crude oil. Almost 400 kilometres of the coastline of Brittany were severely polluted. We remember the pictures on television of the sea life that was destroyed, a tragedy for the fishermen on that coast. All the efforts made afterwards, such as the use of detergents, were merely closing the stable door after the horse had bolted. The grounding of the Brer tanker off the Shetland Islands in 1993 and the Sea Empress disaster off the Welsh coast in 1996 are further examples.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have heard about oil spills in Galway. Galway seems to be better known now for its oil spills in the Claddagh than for the Claddagh itself. Many swans have suffered as a result. Ironically, there was a second oil spill two weeks after a first, when most of the swans had been taken into captivity to deal with the pollution they had already suffered. Small oil spills occur regularly and they have a major effect on our wildlife.</P>
    <P>We have implemented many international agreements and have been pro-active in looking after our marine environment but we are still exposed to significant pollution as a result of accidents at sea. In 2000 there were 28 merchant ships and 100 offshore fishing vessels in Irish seas at any time. That number of vessels could potentially cause an enormous amount of damage. We are between the devil and the deep blue sea, to coin a pun. The time is coming when we will need not only air traffic controllers but sea traffic controllers. At the very least there is a need for marine safety information services that would be extended to incorporate the traffic management of shipping.</P>
    <P>We have all heard about global warming and the ozone layer. Those of us from the west coast are aware that storms are getting worse. Older people say the weather is changing with gales becoming more and more severe. Dublin is almost like another country. Those gales have a serious effect on shipping. The chances of accidents occurring have increased significantly.</P>
    <P>Shipping operators trade within a highly competitive environment and I have no doubt they cut corners. They will use the maximum number of vessels to carry the maximum amount of cargo to get the maximum profit. Many oil tankers pass our coasts but it is not only big ships that could spell disaster for us. There are small spills from onshore terminals, cargo and passenger vessels, fishing boats and other craft. While we welcome exploration for oil and gas off our coast, there is a downside and we must be vigilant about it. We <Col N="635" />should take steps to ensure no spillages occur from the oil exploration platforms.</P>
    <P>Harbours are not equipped to deal with day-to-day spillages. Ships should not be disposing of their waste at sea; there should be facilities in ports to allow for disposal. Comparing private marinas to public harbours, however, is like comparing the public and private health services. The public service is run down and suffering from a lack of investment while the private service is flush with money and can offer a better deal. Public harbours must be upgraded.</P>
    <P>Litter and dumping are the most common problems but oil pollution is potentially more hazardous, with serious implications for our wildlife. We must maximise marine, oil and solid waste disposal. The fines proposed in the Bill should be a deterrent to large companies that would otherwise cut corners. They must know that if things go wrong, they will pay a heavy price. If fines do not act as a deterrent, this legislation will not work. We are located at the doorstep of the major Atlantic shipping routes and the potential for tankers to cause a coastal catastrophe should be borne in mind. The past experience of other countries proves that. The Bill also provides for compulsory insurance because there are always those who will take a chance and not take out insurance. There are cowboys in every industry.</P>
    <P>We must monitor this legislation to ensure it is effective. We saw the terrible potential consequences of the shipment to the MOX fuel plant in Sellafield. The Naval Service and Air Corps were sent out but they could only observe. Real hazards exist. The fish in the Irish Sea are so hot they no longer have to be fried. We must be aware of those hazards because we owe a debt of responsibility to the future. Enforcement must be effective.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope the financial penalties will ensure deterrence is used to the greatest effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, on his appointment and wish him every success in his new brief.</P>
      <P>Coming from one of the few Irish counties that has no coastline, some people might think it strange that I would speak on this Bill. Pollution, however, affects everyone in the State. Many speakers have mentioned Sellafield and the threat it poses to the environment in this country. It affects everyone, no matter where they are located. We should all be concerned about this and take interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with liability and compensation, following the Sea Pollution Act, 1990, and the Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1998. It is difficult, however, to pursue an organisation for compensation, particularly if an incident occurs in international waters. Who should take responsibility and who is liable for the impact on the environment thousands of miles away? An action in <Col N="636" />one part of the world can have a serious impact in another.</P>
    <P>Bio-pollution will become a greater issue in the future. I wish to deal with the issues of bio-pollution and especially ballast water which is becoming a major environmental risk to many of our ports. Large tankers carry sufficient ballast water to fill 2,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Hopefully, in the next few months we will have two such swimming pools here. However, it can be a Trojan horse. Ballast water is taken on board ships to maintain their stability when they are partially laden. When a ship is loaded with cargo, it empties its ballast tanks. In this way, ballast water is sucked up in one port and transported across the ocean to another port where it is discharged with any tiny stowaway organisms which may be present in it and may pose problems in the new environment in which they find themselves. In effect, this builds virtual bridges across the big natural barriers &ndash; oceans, mountain ranges &ndash; and causes the movement of species throughout the world.</P>
    <P>For the most part, many of these organisms fail to gain a foothold in their new environment. However, there has been a handful of cases where serious ecological and economic damage has been caused by bio-pollution. The American comb jelly, similar to the jellyfish, is believed to have been transported in ballast water from the east coast of America to the Black Sea in the 1970s. It soon began competing with indigenous organisms for food, eventually crippling the local anchovy fishing industry. Similarly, in the 1980s the European zebra mussel, native to the Caspian and Black Seas, found its way to the Great Lakes of north America, where it proliferated widely causing serious fouling problems around water intake pipes in power plants and factories. In 1990, the US Federal Government pledged $11 million per year to tackle the problem. It has become a massive problem in the Great Lakes in the United States and has a huge financial impact in that part of the world. There is a belief that this bio-pollutant, the zebra mussel, has been transferred in ballast water from the Caspian and Black Seas to north America.</P>
    <P>Ballast water can be a bio-polluter, a problem that is as old as travel itself, but it has been consistently ignored for many years. Research shows that the increased speed in recent years in transporting goods around the world and the greater efficiency of super tankers and cargo vessels means they are shipped faster around the world and there is a greater opportunity for the successful transfer of these bio-pollutants from one area to another. The speed and the efficiency with which they can transfer cargo and organisms has the effect of shrinking the size of the world. It is suspected that, as ships become faster, organisms are more likely to survive because of the shorter journey times. Some scientists believe pollution around ports may destabilise natural ecosystems, thus enabling exotic organisms to thrive. The issue of tiny aliens in ballast water may have <Col N="637" />major implications for the aquaculture industry. The aquaculture industry here has thrived over many years. In Australia substantial funding has been allocated to research in this area because of the threat posed to aquaculture. It is crucial, therefore, that we recognise the problem and set about putting in place the necessary safeguards to protect the vital assets off our coastline and the aquaculture industry. The Minister is well aware that oil tankers are probably the biggest carriers of ballast water around the world. That is one of the issues that has been debated in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the International Maritime Organisation issued guidelines on ballast water management which were updated in 1997. These included not loading ballast water in shallow water or in areas where propellers could stir up sediment or discharging ballast water unnecessarily. The guidelines suggest that, in some cases, ballast water should be exchanged in open sea, pumping out water drawn from the port in the deep ocean and replacing it with water from the deep ocean, which is less likely to carry organisms or micro-organisms. Many organisms transferred from fresh water into the oceans cannot survive in that environment. It is a method of sterilising the ballast water in the super tankers. Other means of tackling the problem have also been investigated, including the use of heat from the ship's engines to treat the water, chemical treatment and filtration. It is crucially important these guidelines are put in place on an international statutory basis to ensure the protection of the aquaculture industry here and in many other countries around the world. The aquaculture industry is worth in the region of &euro;76 million per annum to this country and should be protected. It is a vital sector of the economy and one that should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate to have escaped in the past because of our poor trade links and the lack of utilisation of our ports. However, these ports are beginning to develop. We have had previous legislation which allows the ports to develop independently. Over time that will bring in additional volumes of traffic to those ports. We have spoken in the past about the need to develop our ports. As they develop there will be a greater risk of ballast water pollution impacting on the aquaculture industry. A good example of that has been the zebra mussel coming into many estuaries. It is crucial that we examine these issues now and not in ten years' time when they have impacted on our ecosystem. This is a serious problem and is a risk to the environment. There has not been the opportunity for this to happen in the past because our ports have not been developed to the same extent as others around the world. However, now more than ever, this is being recognised as a major pollutant. The UK has invested significantly in maritime research.</P>
    <P>It is much easier to prevent such invasion than try to control it subsequent to the pollution arriving on our shores. We cannot recall this biopollutant once it has been released into the envir<Col N="638" />onment, unlike oil for which we have, to some extent, mechanisms to clean up oil pollution. It is virtually impossible to clean up bio-pollution once it happens. There are instances where, with great effort, they can be eradicated or brought under control but the cost involved is significant. It poses a significant risk to our aquaculture industry and the environment and needs to be looked at. It will probably become one of the significant pollutants of this century. As time goes by and as international trade continues it will pose an even greater risk. This is a matter of concern not only on an international basis but on national and regional bases. Statutory agreement has to be sought at international level and the law enforced here and throughout the European Union.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ask his officials to examine this area, bring proposals to his colleagues at European Union level and take it from there to the international stage. This issue has been ignored in the past and it will become an even greater threat in the future. It is imperative we address this issue now and not in ten years' time when we will be faced with a significant problem that will threaten the viability of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The issue of oil pollution was also raised during the debate. We have a huge problem regarding oil pollution of our estuaries, coastline and inland waterways. There is an added problem in our inland waterways regarding the issue of pollution. If pollution takes place along our coastline it can be diluted by way of tidal functions thus dissipating it or bringing it out to sea. We do not have such a mechanism to protect our inland waterways.</P>
    <P>The Shannon-Erne waterway is a significant asset which if developed has the potential to create enormous income and develop a sustained economy throughout the midlands which is the blackspot of this country. We now know the poorest counties are not along the west coast, they are located in the midlands. We must look at ways of developing the facilities needed to promote and encourage investment on the Shannon-Erne waterway. It has enormous potential from a tourism point of view and in generating income in local economies. One of the problems we are faced with as we develop that sector is pollution, an issue that has been ignored to date. We have been forced, through international treaties, to look at the issue regarding our coastline and international waters but we do not have the same type of legislation in place to protect our inland waterways. I ask the Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues, to look at that issue to ensure we have in place the necessary legislation to protect our inland waterways for future generations.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd referred earlier to Sellafield, an issue extremely close to his heart and on which he has campaigned for a considerable time. He raised the issue of the emission of technetium 99 into the Irish Sea and his concerns about a possible agreement between the British and Irish <Col N="639" />Governments in that regard. That gives rise to significant concerns.</P>
    <P>The issue of pollution of the Irish Sea and nuclear radiation is becoming a matter of major concern. We are all aware of concerns regarding radon gas and today's newspapers carry articles regarding uranium found in wells. While we have put in place mechanisms to ensure our water supplies are not polluted we must now carry out testing of water supplies throughout the country. Where we have an opportunity to protect our environment we are faced with the possibility of the British Government, through BNFL, pumping more pollutant into the Irish Sea. The Minister must look again at this issue which is causing major concern throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd also raised the shipment around the world of nuclear fuel from the BNFL facility in Sellafield. A recent shipment sent to Japan with falsified documents had to be returned to Sellafield via the Irish Sea. The return of the shipment and its cargo increased the risk which Irish people face. A French oil tanker was rammed on the route taken by that shipment. The level of security provided on such shipments gives rise to serious concerns. It is now agreed, in light of the incident with the French oil tanker, there is an urgent need to put in place naval protection for such shipments. We have witnessed the number of incidents involving groups such as al-Qaeda in recent years, particularly in the past 18 months. The simplicity with which they planned their actions &ndash; they did not try to ship bombs to areas where there were large numbers of people &ndash; is significant. They can quite easily hijack a vessel and ram a cargo ship. We need to address the issue of the shipment of nuclear products. If we cannot get co-operation in this regard from our counterparts in the United Kingdom, I hope we can address this issue at European level in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>There is enormous potential, in addressing the issue of oil pollution, to look at research regarding micro-organisms and genetic engineering to resolve much of the pollution we have witnessed in recent years. Very little research is being done in this area. It would be very difficult for Ireland to undertake such research on its own but it could be done at European level. I hope the Minister will take into account the issues I have raised when he meets his colleagues in Brussels. Perhaps he will report back over the next couple of years on the successes he has had in addressing these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important Bills to come before the House in a long time. It is a measure that will effect the safety not only of those in maritime counties but also those using the sea for travel and commercial purposes. Insufficient attention has been given to the question of safety at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over recent years we have seen on our televisions and read in our newspapers about the var<Col N="640" />ious accidents which have taken place, and we immediately relate them to the potential danger they present for us as individuals and communities. The grounding of a nuclear submarine on the Isle of Skye was the biggest and most graphic illustration we are likely to get for some time as to the kind of danger presented by the transport of various substances at sea. In this case, the power used to transport them was a nuclear submarine. I appreciate that nuclear submarines are built to deal with many eventualities but, nonetheless, it proves a point.</P>
    <P>There are several elements regarding the transport of noxious substances at sea that affect the safety of the community. Various known and unknown substances are now readily transported and it is not possible to know the quality, type and make-up of some of the substances, or where they are transported from. For instance, will it be possible under EU and international law to correctly identify a substance to be transported from a port? Will the responsibility in the event of a disaster fall on those who issued the licence for transportation of the substance, on the carrier or on the country involved? It is an interesting point.</P>
    <P>An equally important point is the quality of the vessel transporting the substance. There is no sense transporting dangerous substances in substandard vessels or those that have already served their purpose. There is no sense in transporting a substance that is not suitable for transportation because it automatically presents a serious hazard to the community. The route substances travel is important, as Deputy Naughten mentioned, and it is best to choose a less frequently used route and one where less damage will be caused in the event of an accident.</P>
    <P>The availability of suitable and qualified crew is also important. It is extremely dangerous to have crew with little experience or training, and such crew will often not be long-term employees of the firm undertaking the transportation. I mention this because there have been instances where serious sea pollution has arisen from tankers being ill-equipped and poorly crewed.</P>
    <P>These issues have the ability to affect the well-being of the community. A deficiency in one or all of these areas could end with a serious incident. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is familiar with this subject. In recent years, I have put down numerous parliamentary questions in an effort to focus attention on the issue of safety at sea. This affects more than simply those who use the sea &ndash; it affects countries, shorelines, marine life, the community and the environment. A deficiency in any of the areas I and others have mentioned will result in the possibility of a major accident such as has not happened before. It is important to recognise that and put in place mechanisms to deal with the risks.</P>
    <P>I am not certain that the certification of vessels, as is currently required in theory, is sufficiently rigid to ensure high quality vessels for the transportation of noxious substances or hazardous waste. I am speaking from second hand know<Col N="641" />ledge but, from that, I have serious reservations about this area. Vessels that do not meet the requirements present serious problems and bring us back to the question of who has responsibility for such vessels. I do not want to go too far in discussing responsibility for accidents as prevention is better than cure. We should try to eliminate problems and put the responsibility on those who have instigated the transportation such as owners, agents and others.</P>
    <P>British Nuclear Fuels has been mentioned with regard to a cargo that travelled almost twice around the world. It was possible in that case to have illegal or insufficient documentation, which was one breach in the regulations. It is quite possible that other breaches could occur and, if that happened and there was a serious accident, there would be a huge furore when it became known that proper documentation did not exist. We should realise the implications if that happened. In a world of &ldquo;have gun, will travel&rdquo; terrorism, such possibilities should not be far from our minds at any time.</P>
    <P>Certification must be rigid, and enforced vigorously and without exception. There should be no doubt as to where responsibility lies in the event of a disaster. The certification of vessels must be linked directly to the substance transported and there must be liability in the case of misuse of that certification. I emphasise the vulnerability of vessels, particularly when it comes to terrorism. If it becomes known that this type of vessel is on the high seas, it may become a target. There are people who believe they must save the world by killing everyone in it and that must be recognised.</P>
    <P>Although not directly related to this Bill, there are safety at sea regulations that apply to all passenger and cargo vessels. An amazing incident occurred some years ago regarding a passenger ferry transporting people from Ireland. The vessel and its crew passed the necessary tests in Ireland but it was subsequently held in a foreign port as it failed the tests there. I had occasion to question people associated with that incident and I know that there was a valid explanation for it. However, we should consider the implications for Ireland if there was a disaster and it was found that the certification guidelines and procedures had not been adhered to or could not be adhered to. There would be a serious problem and it would be extremely embarrassing. There could also be serious loss of life. There can be a threat of loss of life apart from the environmental threat because collisions at sea, which occur regularly, can involve serious safety issues.</P>
    <P>The agents involved in transportation should fully recognise their responsibilities. There tends to be a certain amount of brokerage in the business in question. That is understandable and is correct in the normal way. However, there also appears to be a haphazard attitude to transport by sea on the basis that it is on the high seas, far from shore, possibly up to 200 miles, and that everything will be fine in any event. That does <Col N="642" />not always follow and in the event of Murphy's Law applying, where if it can happen, it will, the legislation before us or any in this area being updated in Europe needs to be built on the premise that Murphy's Law will apply. If it does not, it is inadequate.</P>
    <P>I found out when questioning the issue of safety at sea that the international law recognised by the European Union is inadequate to deal with the current situation and needs to be updated considerably if it is to protect the lives, way of life and environment of the public. The Bill presents us with an opportunity to review the question of transport by sea and its implications for those involved in and generating transport and for the community at large.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the European element. I know the directive on safety at sea is being reviewed and updated although I am unsure at what stage it is. It should be transposed into our law in the context of the legislation before us because it is fundamental to the issue of safety at sea.</P>
    <P>These issues are probably less prominent for those of us who live inland than for those who live in maritime counties, such as the Acting Chairman. That said, we must all recognise that we live in an island country, which means all transport by sea affects us in some way. Lack of it affects us, adequate transport affects us beneficially and the manner and method of transportation and the type of materials transported have implications for the people in this country because it is not the largest one in the world by a long shot.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation because it is necessary. It must be vigorously enforced and sufficiently comprehensive to ensure that something does not happen in six months' time which can be pointed to as a glaring example of something waiting to happen and which we should have done something about beforehand. We need to ensure the legislation has adequate scope and scale to deal with what has occurred and to anticipate accidents that may happen.</P>
    <P>It is essential to point out that accidents do happen and will happen. While we may not be able to eliminate them, we should try to isolate them as much as possible and try to control the consequences or make them manageable as much as possible. The Ministers present have a direct interest in this because of their geographical location. It will serve them and the legislation well for them to be immersed in its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation. Whether, like me, one comes from a maritime county or, like previous speakers, from an inland county, it is important for all parts of the country that there is adequate legislation to deal with possible threats of pollution on our seas and to deal with the law of the sea. I do not know if the Bill goes far enough in this regard but perhaps it can be strengthened at other Stages. Nonetheless, it is welcome.</P>

      <Col N="643" />Our spokesperson on the marine, Deputy O'Dowd, dealt with the possible threat from British ships carrying nuclear waste, and Deputy Durkan referred to ships being allowed to travel throughout the world with inadequate certification. These are serious matters. I hope the legislation can deal with those aspects which could and would be a threat to Irish coastal waters and Ireland generally. It does not matter if pollution occurs in territorial or international waters, it will have the same effect because we are an island nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten dealt with another aspect which I expect the Minister to refer to, namely, the discharge of ballast waters from ships and the pollution this can cause. Almost unknown dangers are involved. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that.</P>
    <P>The most common threat of pollution comes from the discharge of oil from tankers at sea, whether by accident or otherwise. This is a serious threat and I hope measures will be taken to ensure that this pollution threat is dealt with rigorously. I do not know what penalties there are for this or how they are imposed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowley referred to Galway as being more famous for its oil pollution than for its Claddagh. That is not correct. There was a major oil spill in Galway some time ago which affected the swans in the Claddagh basin. I compliment the efforts of the swan rescue group in Galway for the great work it did at the time.</P>
    <P>There is always a threat from oil pollution. There was a serious oil spill from a tanker in the docks in the past month, and the Minister will be aware of this. Fortunately, because of favourable winds and weather conditions, the oil drifted out to sea and evaporated with no apparent damage to the bay, beaches or swans in the Claddagh basin. That was because of the fortunate circumstances at the time. Does the legislation deal with an oil spill where a tanker in dock accidentally discharges its load?</P>
    <P>Does this legislation cater for such an eventuality?</P>
    <P>How does this legislation cater for sewage pollution to the seas or pollution from the land? An EU directive will ensure that by 2005 every seaside town with a population of more than 10,000 will be obliged to have a sewage treatment plant. I am not sure this is an achievable target in the current economic climate. In County Galway where I have made inquiries the number of sewerage schemes required does not seem achievable. Galway city with a population of more than 70,000, which could be well more than 100,000 if students and tourists are included, is still discharging our untreated sewage into the sea. We are building a modern treatment plant on Mutton Island but that was held up for many years because of objections. The problem will be corrected in the next year or so when the Mutton Island plant is complete. We have been discharging directly into the sea until now although <Col N="644" />the city has had plans for a treatment works for more than the 25 years since I first became involved in local authority matters.</P>
    <P>Galway is only now achieving this and the issue highlights the threat of the pollution of our seas and beaches. In many other towns and villages in Galway our sewage is discharged untreated into the sea. We have lost the blue flag in Salthill, a major tourist area. I blame that on the criminal abuse of our bays and waterways as a result of pollution caused by ourselves. The damage that is or might be caused to our fishing industry as a result of pollution is an issue that must be addressed. What effect do the discharges we make into our seas have on fish life and on the fishing industry?</P>
    <P>What adverse effects do other discharges have? Will the Minister address in the Bill the potential damage, as eloquently outlined by Deputy Naughten, caused by the discharge of ballast waters in our seas? Is there anything in the Bill to control the threat in that regard? Microcosms and other matters could be transported from other parts of the world to our waters through the discharge of ballast water. Are there any regulations in the Bill concerning that or can they be included in it?</P>
    <P>As most speakers have said the Sea is one of our greatest assets and being a maritime country this legislation is overdue. I hope it is strong enough and adequate to deal with the many threats and occurrences of pollution of our sea waters. Can this Bill be improved to deal with that and with the many issues raised by Deputies as a result of the research they have put into the threats and reality of pollution in our waters? The Minister and all of us want to achieve the protection of our waters through this Bill. I hope that will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne) Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate and their welcome and support for the Bill. I am pleased that they see the Bill as providing for a positive measure which will enable Ireland to participate in the best available liability and compensation regime in respect of pollution damage caused by hazardous and noxious substances.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies referred to the background and content of the Bill. Deputy Coveney gave an accurate summation of the position and mentioned the Title of the Bill and the change that has taken place since the Bill was published in April, 2000. I assure the Deputies that I will arrange for amendment of this and for an amendment to reflect the introduction of the euro on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other matters raised by almost all Deputies were the enforcement of costs and the MOX plant at Sellafield. This is a civil liability Bill and there will be no direct costs to the Exchequer. The costs relating to an incident will be met in the first instance by the ship owner's insurance, <Col N="645" />up to a certain threshold above which, or in cases where the pollution source cannot be identified or liability cannot be proved, costs will be paid from the HNS fund which is financed by those who receive the materials concerned. The provisions enabling the Minister to appoint inspectors to enforce the legislation are similar to those which already exist in regard to sea pollution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kehoe and others raised the issue of the MOX plant. I reiterate that the question of proposing a ban on the passage of ships carrying nuclear material remains difficult given the right of passage enshrined in the United Nations convention on the law of the sea. International conventions play a vital role in regard to safety at sea and the protection of the marine environment. Given our exposed coastline it is important we comply with these. The Government is doing everything possible, within the framework of international law, to continue expressing concerns in regard to the MOX plant and to fight our case with the UK Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kehoe also asked about experience to date in regard to breaches of the convention. Nothing is available as it has not entered into force internationally to date. He also mentioned arrangements for checking vessels. Every vessel carrying dangerous goods is obliged to report the details of its cargo to the harbour master before departure from the port under the European Union's Minimum Requirements for Vessels Carrying Goods Regulations, 1995.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore mentioned that it has taken six years to bring this legislation to the Dáil &ndash; I have only been here three months. He also referred to the delay since the Bill was published in April, 2000. I regret the delay but I appreciate that it arose because of demands on the Oireachtas schedule. We are ahead of our EU counterparts in other states who have been asked to report on developments by June, 2004. I assure Deputies that Ireland is well ahead of most member states in preparing draft regulations. Deputy Gilmore also suggested that a map would be helpful in identifying the exact jurisdiction to which this legislation is to apply. I have arranged to have this map sent to the Deputy and to other Deputies who were in attendance at the debate on that occasion. Like other Deputies, Deputy Gilmore was also concerned about radioactive materials that are not covered by this legislation. As I previously stated, vessels carrying radioactive materials are covered under a separate convention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also referred to the 1999 study on emergency towing vessels. I can assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to ensuring we have the most effective arrangements in place in this regard, through co-operation with UK authorities where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Although it was somewhat off the subject, my colleague from Wexford, Deputy Twomey, talked about fishing, the Irish Box and the Fischler proposals. I can assure the Deputy that we are very much on top of this problem. The Minister, <Col N="646" />Deputy Dermot Ahern, has had meetings with Commissioner Fischler and ministers from other like-minded EU countries and we are dealing effectively and urgently with that problem to ensure the livelihoods of the fishermen around our coastline are protected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morgan raised a number of issues about compensation and other areas. The compensation levels are considered adequate, but there is a provision in the convention for increased compensation if so desired. He asked about emergency response legislation. That has been in place since 1999.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan spoke about the sad history of Bantry Bay. Conventions and legislation are in place to deal with the situations he mentioned. He proposed that an emergency towing vessel should be located in Bantry Bay. I note his suggestions, but a number of other Deputies suggested different parts of the country. We will have to deal with that as it arises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan spoke about dumping at sea. Legislation is already in place under the 1996 Act. He also raised the threat of pollution and specifically the prevention of pollution from ships. The Sea Pollution Act, 1991, gives effect to the MARPOL Convention and deals with this issue. He asked about hazardous substances, which are being dealt with under various international codes. We will get copies of the codes for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowley talked about the importance of the west of Ireland for fishing and mentioned safety as well as the importance of rivers. I agree with many of the points he made.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dowd suggested the Bill be amended to deal with the transport of nuclear material. As I said earlier, this is not included in the convention, but is covered in separate international conventions. He also talked about increased discharges into the Irish Sea. I agree those are not acceptable. He mentioned the security of ferry ships, like the ones that travel from Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead, or Rosslare to Fishguard or Cherbourg. This is particularly relevant in the light of statements made by Prime Minister Blair in the past week concerning security. This is being actively pursued at EU and international level, as it cannot simply be addressed at an Irish level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten talked about bio-pollution, ballast water and the threat to the environment. This is being pursued through the International Maritime Organisation. He also spoke about pollution in inland waterways. We would be anxious to ensure they are protected. He also talked about security for the shipment of nuclear material.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan raised a number of issues that had been raised by different Deputies throughout the debate. In relation to shipping traffic, lanes are already set out and determined by the IMO. The Department agrees with his views on the importance of having fully qualified crews. He also spoke about safety of vessels, enforcement, <Col N="647" />vulnerability in relation to security, and the laws relating to safety at sea.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kehoe would know, from 1 January there will be stringent regulations in the area of angling. We have had a Department roadshow involving a number of public meetings throughout the country, where Department officials spoke to the fishermen and the general public. Particularly after the tragedy in Fethard, where a number of people lost their lives, it was incumbent on us in the Department, fully supported by Opposition spokespersons, to act quickly to address this problem to ensure people going out to sea would at all times meet the safety requirements as laid down by the Department. We are introducing stringent but necessary regulations to deal with safety at sea.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack raised issues relating to oil pollution, which is already covered in separate legislation. He also mentioned pollution from land sources, which is covered by separate legislation under Department of the Environment and Local Government regulations. Although ballast water is not covered by this Bill, I note the comments made by the Deputy and by Deputy Naughten.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for raising the issues and we will discuss them more fully on Committee Stage to see what amendments can be made based on ideas that have come from both sides of the House during the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was interrupted, I was explaining the terms of the United Nations Convention against the illicit traffic of drugs, better known as the Vienna Convention. As the law stands, any state that is party to the convention, can stop and seize another vessel sailing under the flag of another state that is party to the convention, if the auth<Col N="648" />orities of the seizing state suspect the vessel in question is carrying drugs for import or export contrary to the law of another country. A difficulty remains in the law in relation to who has jurisdiction if a vessel is seized. This Bill was proposed primarily to deal with that issue. I will shortly also speak about one other very important amendment.</P>
      <P>A requirement of surrender or release would, under the agreement, have to be made within 14 days of the receipt of a summary of evidence from the arresting state. The summary would itself have to be given to the flag state as soon as possible after arrest. If, as is expected to be the norm as I have already indicated, flag states do not exercise their right to preferential jurisdiction under the agreement, the arresting state will be free to initiate a prosecution under its domestic law.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Bill, it is fitting that I should pay tribute to the commitment of the men and women of the Garda Síochána, the Customs National Drugs Team and the Naval Service who are tasked with the continuing fight against drug trafficking at sea. The bravery and dedication, which they bring to their work in dealing with drug trafficking by sea, which is often carried on in extreme and hazardous weather conditions, has continued to yield substantial results in terms of seizures of drugs and arrests for smuggling. Figures available for the past six years show that the Irish Customs Service examined 2,087 vessels. In the five year period ending December 2000, some 970 kilograms of cocaine and 3,280 kilograms of cannabis resin with a total estimated street value of &euro;256.5 million has been seized at sea.</P>
      <P>Co-operation between the law enforcement agencies of the member states and beyond is vital in tackling the supply of drugs as drug traffickers recognise no national borders and the drugs trade is truly international. At national level, initiatives to enhance operational co-operation between law enforcement agencies include the development of a memorandum of understanding and a working protocol between the Garda Síochána and the customs service and the establishment of a joint task force incorporating the Garda Síochána, customs and the Naval Service to combat international drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>In terms of international co-operation, a number of initiatives have been undertaken including the appointment of drugs liaison officers to Europol and Interpol in London, Paris, Madrid and The Hague to enable the exchange of information and intelligence between Ireland and our EU partners. The Garda national drugs unit continues to maintain close contact with law enforcement agencies within the EU and in non-EU countries. These contacts have borne fruit and a number of significant internationally driven seizures have been made. The drug barons and traffickers must be made to realise that our law enforcement agencies will continue to work together and enhance their co-operation in order to combat the international trade in drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" />The Bill provides for a convention state which is a party to the agreement &ndash; provided for in section 3 &ndash; to make a request in accordance with section 7 to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the surrender to that state in relation to a drug trafficking offence of a person who has been arrested, a vessel which has been detained or anything on the vessel which has been seized or detained, while on the high seas under procedures already provided for in section 35 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. When a convention state vessel is taken to an Irish port and detained, any person arrested will be brought before the High Court as soon as possible in accordance with section 5. The court will then remand the person pursuant to section 6 pending an order by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for that person's surrender to the convention state on foot of a request by the convention state.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the request, the Minister will certify under section 8 that a request for the surrender of the person has been duly made. Where the court is satisfied that a request for the surrender of the person has been made and evidence of an arrest warrant is produced as provided in section 9, the court, subject to certain requirements, will make an order committing the person to prison or, if under 21 years of age, to a remand institution. The person must then await the order of the Minister for his or her surrender.</P>
    <P>In compliance with the requirements as set out in section 9 and before committing the person, the court will inform him or her that he or she will not be surrendered except with his or her consent before 15 days have elapsed and also inform him or her of the provisions of Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution relating to the making of a complaint to the High Court that a person is unlawfully detained. A person committed to await surrender may be released as a result of a successful application under Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution or as a result of an appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court, or if the surrender and conveyance out of the State of the person is unduly delayed, as indicated in section 20. In the absence of any such request for surrender being received within 18 days of the arrest of the person, the Minister, in accordance with section 21, must order his or her release without prejudice, however, to proceedings being taken in the State against the person for the drug trafficking offence in question.</P>
    <P>There is always the possibility that the arresting officers might find evidence of offences other than drug trafficking, for example, illegal arms. In such a case, the consent of the flag state will be required for a prosecution in the arresting state. However, the arresting state will be free to prosecute for any offence occurring after the vessel has been taken into its territory, for example, if the vessel's crew assaults an arresting officer. This provision is contained in section 14. A requirement to surrender a person to a flag state will take priority over any domestic proceedings and <Col N="650" />the High Court is being given power to order the suspension of any such proceedings, without prejudice to their eventual reinstatement as provided in section 15.</P>
    <P>Under section 17 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may order the surrender of a person to a person duly authorised by the convention state to receive such a person, if satisfied that the request for surrender is in accordance with the agreement. A similar power is granted to the Minister in section 18 in respect of vessels and evidence. Provision is made to ensure that any arrested person is given time, before surrender, to make a complaint to the courts under Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution that his or her detention is unlawful and this is provided for in section 19.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to an unusual requirement of the agreement which under Article 15.5 makes provision for the flag state, instead of seeking surrender of the detained vessel and crew, to request the intervening state to release them forthwith without charge. When such request is made the intervening state is obliged to release them. Provision for this requirement is made in section 21(<i>d</i>) of the Bill. In drawing up the agreement, the experts felt that it would be difficult to foresee all the kinds of situations that might arise in its practical operation. It was therefore agreed to include this provision as an exceptional safety valve in case something went entirely wrong in the procedure. The explanatory report with the agreement makes it clear, however, that this provision would only be relied upon in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Provision for Ireland, as the flag state, to exercise its right to preferential jurisdiction and seek the return of a person detained by a convention state or the handing over of a vessel or thing seized by that state is included in section 24. On receipt of notification of such detention or seizure for an alleged drug trafficking offence, the Minister will decide, after consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, whether the State should exercise its preferential jurisdiction for the return of the person, vessel or thing. If such jurisdiction is to be exercised, the Director of Public Prosecutions may then apply to the District Court for a warrant of arrest of the person detained or the handing over of the vessel or thing detained. Provision is included in this section for the issue of warrants and for the alleged offence to be treated as having been committed in any place in the State.</P>
    <P>Some changes to the 1994 Act are necessitated by this Bill and I will now give an outline of these along with some other important changes on the scope of offences covered. The agreement, at Article 3, also requires that each party to it shall take such steps as are necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the relevant offences, namely, any of the drug trafficking offences described in Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Vienna Convention, whether committed on board a vessel registered in a convention state or a vessel of no nationality. <Col N="651" />Section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, is being amended to take account of this requirement so that it will apply to such drug trafficking offences and not, as at present, only the offences of possession of controlled drugs or carrying drugs for import or export. This provision is contained in section 28(<i>b</i>). This amendment will widen the range of drug trafficking offences at sea to include not only those to which I have already referred, but all drug trafficking offences, as comprehended in the 1994 Act, when committed on board an Irish ship, a convention state ship or a ship not registered in any country or territory. While the Council of Europe agreement obliges us to make such provision only for ships of the Council of Europe states, this provision is being extended to also include the ships of all convention states under the United Nations convention. Were this provision not so extended, it would result in the unsatisfactory situation of having a narrower range of offences applying to the ships of United Nations member states than would apply to ships of Council of Europe member states.</P>
    <P>In bringing this Bill before the House, the opportunity is being taken to make amendments to sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which relate to enforcement powers, jurisdiction and prosecution provisions for convention state vessels which are outside the landward limits of the territorial seas of the State. At present, the authority of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is sought in relation to such vessels and that authority may not be granted unless the Minister has obtained the consent of the foreign state. In consequence, action may not be taken against convention state vessels in Irish territorial waters, which are suspected of drug smuggling offences, unless the consent of the flag state has been obtained. During the drafting of the legislation, advice received from the Attorney General indicated that where such a vessel is in Irish territorial waters the consent of the foreign state to board the vessel is not necessary and sections 35 and 36 are being amended to take account of this advice. The amendments to give effect to these changes are contained in section 28(<i>c</i>) of the Bill. The question of preferential jurisdiction for flag ship states &ndash; the main purpose of the Bill &ndash; does not arise where the ship is arrested within territorial waters.</P>
    <P>I hope that the proposals contained in this significant and somewhat technical Bill will meet with the approval of all Deputies. This Bill honours an important international obligation and, furthermore, is a positive indication at an international level of both our ongoing determination to tackle transnational organised crime and our continuing commitment to tackle the scourge of drugs in our society. This is one of a number of Bills which will be dealt with over the coming months which will lead to ratification of international agreements. Proposed legislation dealing with terrorist offences will enable Ireland to ratify <Col N="652" />the UN conventions for suppression of the financing of terrorism and terrorist bombings as well as the UN convention against the taking of hostages and the prevention of attacks on internationally protected persons. Effect will also be given to EU framework decisions on combating terrorism and allowing for the establishment of joint investigation teams.</P>
    <P>I believe all Deputies will agree with the general purpose and thrust of the Bill. I hope we can get it enacted quickly so that the process can be put in train to enable us to ratify this important international agreement. Ratification of this agreement will be a further demonstration of our willingness to do all we can, in conjunction with our international partners, to continue to tackle organised crime and particularly to ensure the perpetrators of drug smuggling offences are brought to justice. I will listen carefully to comments and suggestions during the debate and we will have an opportunity to amend the Bill on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Hayes.</P>
      <P>This Bill does two things. In relation to the area outside the 12 mile limit, once Ireland becomes part of the UN convention, the Naval Service will have authority to deal with boats suspected of carrying drugs. In the present situation, there are difficulties in that regard and that is one good reason for enacting this Bill. In the area within the 12 mile limit, there is a rather similar problem whereby the Naval Service cannot search suspect vessels, in certain circumstances, without having either a garda or a customs officer on board. The Bill will also rectify that.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the Bill is enacted without delay. To facilitate that, I have asked my Fine Gael colleagues who will speak in this debate to abbreviate their remarks. Our Naval Service urgently needs the measures provided for in the Bill. I compliment the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin, and her staff on their part in expediting the arrival of the Bill in the House a few weeks sooner than might otherwise have been the case. This Bill is a matter of vital national security, it is a good Bill and it is urgently needed. Our Naval Service is doing an incredibly good job with the resources available and deserves our support through the early enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully endorse Deputy Deasy's comments on the importance of this Bill which my party strongly supports. Any measures to assist in tackling the drugs problem are welcome. The extent to which that problem has taken hold in our society is frightening. Criminal activity in Ireland has practically doubled in each decade since the 1950s and it is estimated that some 66% of such activity is drug-related, with a particular focus on four or five areas in Dublin. Crime is one of the greatest concerns in our communities <Col N="653" />and is a particular worry for elderly people in cities, towns and villages. In the 1950s and 1960s, people in rural Ireland did not feel a need to lock their doors. That is no longer the case and rural residents now live in constant fear of intruders, as is also the case in urban areas, where people are afraid to go outside their doors at night.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an important contribution towards dealing with drug-related crime and it is for that reason Fine Gael has decided to facilitate its speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, as stated by our spokesman on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Deasy. It is incumbent on all parties in the House to support the efforts to tackle this serious issue. In many cases, the parents of our present generation of young people have little knowledge or acquaintance with the drugs culture which is festering in our society and they are desperately worried for the sake of their children, whether in college or second level schools or elsewhere. It is essential this threat to society is tackled effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Fine Gael Deputies on their brevity and their succinct presentation. The Labour Party also welcomes the Bill which should have been introduced much sooner. It refers to the Vienna Convention which was agreed in Strasbourg on 31 January 1995. Following a delay of seven years, perhaps another day or two will not make a great difference. We have already passed a deadline as this legislation was supposed to be enacted before the end of 2001. In that regard, we are out of kilter with our European neighbours. The original UN convention on this matter goes back even further, to 1988. As an island country with an open seas policy, we are highly vulnerable. We should have been trawling abroad at a much earlier stage for conventions of this nature at UN and, more recently, European Council level with a view to using such international instruments to strengthen our capacity to deal with organised crime on the high seas.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that action was not taken much earlier in this regard, since the basis for this legislation was readily available seven or even 12 years ago. We should not have allowed ourselves to be in breach of our responsibilities at European Council level by failing to meet the deadline at the end of 2001. Deputy Deasy has curtailed his remarks on the basis of facilitating the expeditious passage of the Bill. Why has it taken so long for the Government to move on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is straightforward and has been outlined by the Minister of State. It gives effect to the Council of Europe agreement on illicit trafficking by sea, implementing the United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic and psychotropic substances which is narrowly defined and deals with limited powers. It is a very simple type of convention concerning the powers of states to board and detain vessels <Col N="654" />and their crews on the high seas if they are suspected of being involved in drug trafficking. The Bill provides for greater elaboration and explanation of the provisions of the convention and sets out the powers that Ireland has with regard to jurisdiction over such vessels and crews for the purposes of prosecution. That is the nub of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The member states which have shared jurisdiction have not directly agreed on the issue of priority in terms of jurisdiction for prosecution. There is shared jurisdiction but not quite shared prosecution. Obviously, one of the states has to have preferential status in relation to prosecution. This has been determined in the legislation. While the flag state will have preferential standing for prosecution, this does not deny the arresting state from initiating proceedings if there is any tardiness on the part of the flag state or if the flag state waives priority. As a result, we will have many more cases coming before the courts. Resources, therefore, will be a major issue.</P>
    <P>The legislation has been brought forward in the context of the action plan on organised crime, agreed by Heads of Government at the Amsterdam Council in June 1997, at which the target date was agreed for the ratification of the convention into domestic law. Organised crime is the nub of the issue and the greatest problem facing the country and has been so for a long time. Ireland has come from being a country which had no problem with drug trafficking and no drug crisis a couple of decades ago to being one of the countries in the world where there is a critical level of drug abuse. Any measures taken to date have had very little success in dealing with this enormous problem. Any measures taken to deal with the supply of drugs have also had no effect. The situation is deteriorating, not improving. The European Union was looking at an action plan on organised crime, of which this would be another building block to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>As Ireland is an island nation, the question of drug trafficking on the high seas is critical from a domestic and international point of view. We continue to have a very significant drugs problem. The use of narcotic substances, particularly among young people, is one of the great blights on the social landscape. The financial, economic, social and health problems associated with the problem are immense.</P>
    <P>Much valuable work has been done in recent years to tackle the scourge of drug addiction. The national drugs strategy, for example, has become a valuable means through which to channel resources to deal with the problem. However, as long as there is a demand for narcotic and psychotropic substances, there will be a supply. The question of supply and demand is closely linked to the legislation.</P>
    <P>There is also a geographical element to the question of supply and demand. Ireland, an island in a peripheral location on the western seaboard of Europe, is a gateway to the rest of the Continent for drug traffickers and those who import <Col N="655" />and export drugs. In this context, I draw the attention of the House to an expert report published in 2000 by the United States Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs which identified Ireland as a potential gateway to Europe for international drug traffickers. The report stated Ireland was not considered to be a major player in international drug trafficking, although &ldquo;increasing drug abuse among Irish youth continues to have a significant domestic impact.&rdquo;  It warned, very worryingly, that an extensive and largely unguarded coastline may mean a future increase in drug flows into, out of and through Ireland, and cited the numerous coastline inlets as suitable entry points for international drug traffickers. It pointed out that there was a constant drugs flow throughout the country and stated, &ldquo;Irish authorities acknowledge that the Republic remains a gateway for imports of cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines to continental Europe&rdquo;. We could add heroin to the list. This is a damning and revealing statement which highlights beyond any doubt the contribution this Bill will make towards ending Ireland's &ldquo;gateway status&rdquo; for the international drugs trade.</P>
    <P>Our status as a gateway country for drug trafficking should not surprise anyone. As an island nation, we are a prime target for drug traffickers, particularly from the other side of the Atlantic, to be used as a useful stop-off point on the way to the continent of Europe with large quantities of illegal substances. The United States report also cited Colombia as an example of the type of country that would look on Ireland as a suitable entry point to the continent of Europe and as a country which might be perceived to have less comprehensive anti-drug legislation than other European states.</P>
    <P>The Bill will only make a minor contribution in tackling what is an extensive and difficult problem. The resources from central government to the Naval Service are most important. The Naval Service is at the coalface in the battle against drug trafficking. There is little point in passing this and similar Bills unless those charged with responsibility for the implementation of laws are provided with the necessary resources and staffing. The enactment of the legislation will not be much of a deterrent unless the criminals involved know that Ireland intends to implement it vigorously on the high seas through the Naval Service and other coastguard agencies.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister of State to spell out the level of funding and resources he will provide to support the authorities which will seek to enforce the legislation on the high seas night and day and prevent Ireland from becoming a gateway for the export and import of illegal substances. The Naval Service, Garda and customs authorities have shown themselves to be very competent and effective, albeit with meagre resources at times. They continue to fight the scourge of drug trafficking daily and usually are effective. There have <Col N="656" />been a number of high profile seizures at ports in recent years. Think of what could be done with more resources. For every drug shipment seized how many are getting through? What about drug trafficking on the high seas beyond ports and customs desks? Surely there is a need for greater concentration of resources on stopping drugs arriving at ports in the first place.</P>
    <P>The critical issue is that of resources. We can pass all the legislation we wish, but if we do not have the means of patrolling the high seas and the seas around our coast, we will do nothing to affect the importation of drugs. What new proposals does the Minster of State have? We have the skimpiest naval defence fleet anywhere in the European Union and have now been told that it is unlikely our fishermen will be able to fish in the Irish Sea and that the Irish fishing boxes are at risk. Will we receive any compensation for these limitations? What does the European Union propose to do, especially given that the US report I mentioned refers to Ireland as an international gateway for the supply of drugs to Ireland, Britain and Europe? If our seas are to be divided among the EU member states for the purpose of fisheries, the EU should make a more substantial contribution to providing this country with compensatory resources. By patrolling the high seas around Ireland, we are patrolling the coastline of Europe, in effect. As Ireland is the member state that is the most open to the Atlantic, we can easily become the gateway to Europe in many respects. Resources other than our own should be allocated to help us to patrol our seas. It is inadequate to expect a small country to fulfil the requirements of the many conventions that come from the Council of Europe and the United Nations, especially in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Drug smuggling is the most serious type of international crime at present. Pirates patrolled the high seas in the past, but drug smuggling on the high seas around Ireland, particularly around the continental shelf and the Irish Sea, is the greatest threat to our security. I urge the Minister to make proposals to fund the Naval Service in the context of the implementation of this Bill, as it will be worthless if he does not do so. The navies of other countries should assist us to patrol our seas as part of the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Jurisdiction over a vessel which is captured and which is believed to be in possession of a quantity of illegal drugs is an important component of this Bill. That a crew which is arrested for drug trafficking on the high seas can be charged with an offence under Irish law, or under the law of the flag state, means there should be no escape route for such criminals. I welcome that central provision of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will address one or two more aspects of this legislation. Why does the Bill not include a definition of the word &ldquo;thing&rdquo;? What is a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;? I am sure the word has been chosen to cover every eventuality. There is a reference to it in section 14(1), for example: &ldquo;a vessel or thing which has <Col N="657" />been detained or retained&rdquo;. An indication of the parameters of such a vague term should be indicated in the section of the Bill which deals with the definition of terms.</P>
    <P>Why does section 29(2) state that &ldquo;this Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may fix either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision&rdquo;? It seems evident that the Bill should come into operation as soon as it has been signed by the President. I do not see any reason to restrict its date of implementation to a ministerial decision at some future date. If we want to implement this legislation quickly, we should delete that section entirely, thereby bringing the Bill into force on the date it is signed by the President.</P>
    <P>I am nonplussed by section 21, which assigns powers to the Minister in relation to the release of a person. It states that the Minister can order the release of a person remanded under section 6 if &ldquo;there are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person has committed the offence in respect of which he or she has been remanded&rdquo;. There seems to be a suggestion that while reasonable grounds may have existed, they will somehow have evaporated. If the grounds for arrest were seen to be reasonable at that time, they must have been reasonable. It is not as if reasonable grounds disappear like snow from the ground. Grounds for arrest are either reasonable or they are not. It is dangerous to include such a provision in legislation. It is wrong that a Minister can state that he believes there are no longer reasonable grounds for holding a person, as such matters are for the courts to decide. It is appropriate to allow the courts to be the deciding body in such matters, whereas it is quite dangerous to give authority to the Minister, under this Bill, to act as a despot who can decide, willy-nilly, whether reasonable grounds for detention exist.</P>
    <P>Despite the reservations I have outlined, I commend this Bill and I look forward to teasing out its details on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to share my time with Deputies Finian McGrath and Arthur Morgan.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as it stands before the House today. It goes a long way towards tidying up certain issues that need to be dealt with. When we talk about drugs, we are talking about a social justice issue, for the most part, and &ldquo;the scourge of drugs&rdquo;, as the Minister described the problem, should be addressed in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only too aware that certain areas of the law in this area need to be tidied up. I remember being on a vessel in the middle of Galway Bay five years ago when it was blowing half a gale. A small Zodiac boat appeared in the distance and, as it approached, we could see that six people were on board. It transpired that representatives of the Garda Síochána, the Customs National Drugs Team and the Naval Service were paying a routine visit to check our vessel, although I could have been forgiven for thinking that a high-<Col N="658" />level meeting of the various branches of the various forces was taking place at the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume everything was above board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything that should have been above board was above board. The Deputy will be happy to know that the officials did not spend much time talking to us and that they left in a hurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a shot across their bows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly seemed to me that to have three branches of State coming to meet an innocent pleasure boat in the middle of Galway Bay was a misuse of resources. We need to tighten up these matters.</P>
      <P>I am nervous about the Minister's statements about &ldquo;the scourge of drugs&rdquo;. If a scintilla of the efforts being applied in legislation such as this was applied to the parts of Ireland affected by drugs, we would see much better results. Some people refer to a war on drugs, whereas I see it as a need to reduce the harm inflicted on certain people in society. Our resources should be targeted at reducing that harm, rather than adopting George W. Bush's style of rhetoric by referring to a war on drugs. The war on drugs cannot and will not be won, as there will always be people who use drugs. Our challenge is to ensure that we reduce the number of people taking drugs and that we provide alternatives for those who feel they need to take drugs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello is well aware of the parts of Dublin where a vast amount of drug users live. It was agreed ten years ago that the hotspots of drug taking should be targeted. These areas need proper housing, health care, sports and recreation facilities and child care. It is only when such steps are taken that we will be able to say that we are really tackling the drugs problem. Fianna Fáil has made great efforts to discuss RAPID funding and various ways and means of dealing with the drugs problem, but very little RAPID funding has been spent. There have been many meetings and a great deal of discussion, but very little has been done on the ground to ensure that those who are inclined to take drugs might be deterred from doing so. We simply have to provide alternatives in the areas like recreation, housing and sports that I have mentioned if we are to tackle the problems caused by drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be cautious of the language we use when describing drugs. To talk about the street value of drugs captured is a bit like driving around the corner of a country lane, hitting a cow and talking about the street value of it being thousands of euro. It is a language that does not help when discussing the difficulties of drugs in society. We should use more measured descriptions in order to address realistically the problems that exist. I agree that the web of bureaucracy surrounding the difficulties the Naval Service, the <Col N="659" />customs service and the Garda face on the high seas needs to be tightened up. The Naval Service needs significant reform to transform itself from where it was some years ago to being at the cutting edge of coast guard services, drugs services and so on.</P>
    <P>In essence, I support the Bill but if we are to address what the Minister referred to as the scourge of drugs, we need to put more resources into communities from where the drug users, including future drug users, come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF" hpid="Mr. Morgan Mr. Morgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sinn Féin welcomes any move towards strengthening the laws designed to prevent the importation of illegal and harmful drugs into the State. It is particularly mindful of the need to ensure as far as possible that anyone involved in this trade does not escape prosecution because of perceived loopholes in international law governing the prevention of drugs trafficking. As such, Sinn Féin will support the Bill which makes Article 17 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances part of the domestic legislation of the State. It is hoped also that it will put greater pressure on countries from which these shipments originate to deal with such activities by drug traffickers using their ports and flags.</P>
      <P>The international drugs trade is a menace to this country. It has penetrated almost every country in the world. It is a secretive economy which is worth billions of euro each year. It is responsible for the deaths of millions of people and for the social decay of large parts of the world, including sections of many of our own cities and towns. The cost of this stretches far beyond the actual crime that is a direct result of drug pushing and addiction. It affects our health services, child care and every other aspect of social policy, including the costs involved. The drugs economy is one where a small minority of extremely wealthy individuals earn vast fortunes from the misery of others. These people who finance and organise the shipments must be made to pay the price for their activities. While it is unlikely that such individuals will be on board vessels carrying drugs, I hope the ratification of the convention will make their prosecution more likely. We must also be aware &ndash; this is something Deputies will bear in mind when scrutinising the provisions under the convention &ndash; that while states have the option to prosecute traffickers caught in the territorial waters of other states, not all states are equally committed to preventing the use of their territory and ships flying their flags for the production and transportation of drugs. Perhaps this is something we might seek to address by way of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While welcoming the legislation, we would wish to enter some qualifications to our support for the Bill. One of these has to do with the manner in which it is proposed to ensure that vessels transporting drugs are actually apprehended. This State has a long coastline of some 3,000 kilometres, yet the resources devoted to protecting it <Col N="660" />from drugs smugglers are fairly minimal. Huge parts of the coastline are unprotected for most of the time. A large number of major shipments that we are aware of have been landed along the western coast over the past number of years. To a large extent, this is a consequence of the lack of resources devoted to combating the drugs trade. The Naval Service is small and could not possibly be expected to police the entire coastline. Consideration might, therefore, be given to the establishment of a dedicated anti-drugs marine-based unit, similar to those that exist in other jurisdictions as a coast guard. We would argue that if the commitments made in the Bill to tackle the drugs trade are to be fulfilled, such an investment in human and other resources will be necessary. Otherwise the Bill will become just another well meaning but ineffective gesture towards combating this menace.</P>
    <P>As someone who has been involved in the fishing industry and in daily contact with coastal fishing communities, if even a portion of the time and energy which the Naval Service devotes to preventing Irish fishermen making a livelihood from their legitimate occupation was given to monitoring and intercepting drugs shipments, we would be in a happier position. This issue has been highlighted once again this week with the proposals to further open our waters to exploitation by other EU states.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the State needs to improve its intelligence and surveillance of those involved in financing the drugs shipments. As I pointed out earlier, this is a business which requires large sums of money to be invested in both the drugs themselves and in the vessels used to transport them. It is not something which most people would have the means to become involved in as they simply would not have the money to do so. It is true that much of the investment comes from well known criminal gangs, but that is not the full picture. We also know from some of the work done by investigative reporters and from the odd conviction that some seemingly respectable people are prepared to invest their money to import the drugs that cause havoc in our communities. It is not so long ago that a former member of the Irish Aviation Authority, appointed to that body by a previous Government, was convicted of importing large amounts of cocaine. Other so-called pillars of the community have been caught in similar circumstances, all apparently upstanding members of society who were prepared to make a quick buck at the expense of the most vulnerable sections of our people.</P>
    <P>It is the need to tackle this aspect of the problem and to identify and deal with the individuals who supply the money and vessels to transport drugs from abroad into this jurisdiction that is crucial to even beginning to put an end to the current problem. I hope the Bill will be a step in that direction. I would also like to see a wider campaign by the Government to ensure the problem is dealt with in a concerted fashion at all levels. While welcoming the Bill as a further <Col N="661" />measure to prevent the importation of drugs, Sinn Féin also recognises the need to pursue a much wider strategy to curtail and, if possible, put an end to trafficking. A large part of that can be implemented as part of the enforcement of the measures contained in the Bill. It will be absolutely essential if the proposed legislation is to be effective. We will be closely following the debate and further scrutinising the Bill as it progresses through the House. We hope to make further interventions at later Stages if we feel that is necessary to ensure the legislation becomes effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill, together with a strong agency to enforce it, will have the capacity to reduce some of the misery and hardship which people are suffering as a result of these drugs shipments getting through. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate and I am happy to acknowledge the presence of my good friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who was my leader when I first became a public representative ten years ago. I am pleased he has since kept a close eye on me and I wish him well with his work.</P>
      <P>The menace of drugs continues to be a major social and community problem throughout the country. My constituency of Dublin South-West which has major population centres, including Greenhills, Templeogue, Firhouse and Tallaght, has witnessed first hand the effects of the drugs culture on families and neighbourhoods. I support all measures that will serve to limit or reduce the exposure of so many to this hideous trade. Since entering public life, I have not had a week &ndash; I know many of my colleagues also experience this &ndash; without receiving representations from mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, even grandparents, asking for assistance and advice on where to go for help because family members have become victims of this illicit trade. In addition, I receive representations from many local groups regarding anti-social behaviour within their neighbourhoods as a result of the drugs culture. I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, on the excellent work being done by him and his officials in implementing the Government's national drugs programme, which was launched by his predecessor, my friend Deputy Eoin Ryan. I hope the good work will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within my area, particularly in Tallaght, many support groups are working very hard on behalf of the community, including the Tallaght Drugs Task Force, which until recently was chaired by my friend, Mr. Chris Flood, whom I replaced in the Dáil and who was a Member since 1987. His work as Minister of State with responsibility for local development impressed many on all sides of the House. Many other groups in the area such as the SWAN family support group, the Tallaght Rehabilitation <Col N="662" />Project and the various community drugs support groups in Killinarden, Brookfield and Jobstown, Tymon North and St. Dominic's parish, and others throughout the country, work untiringly in support of the victims of drug abuse. Equally importantly, their families need the full support of this House for their aspirations and acknowledgement for their achievements.</P>
    <P>The impact of drugs within communities can be described easily by many of us. We all have many examples of what happens. The increase in crime as a result of the drugs menace and the undermining of the sense of security of our elderly is to be abhorred. Actions taken initially to control and eventually to eradicate this menace must be supported.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House as it brings our legislation into line with the Council of Europe's Agreement on Illicit Traffic by Sea and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The detail in the Bill appears to be a regularisation rule which will be common to all members signing up to these conventions. In terms of its impact, I cannot help but wonder as to the point of the Bill. It gives representatives of this country the right to board a ship of another convention state while it is outside our territorial waters, but only with the express permission of that state. I thought all drug seizures worldwide were the result of intelligence gathering and the co-operation of police forces across the globe. The need to monitor suspect vessels is vital, but where is the point in boarding or arresting a vessel in international waters and having it brought to an Irish port? Surely the law enforcement agencies at the port of destination are best positioned to effect the necessary swoop on the vessel's illegal contents.</P>
    <P>Considering the various strands of procedure necessary to effect this arresting activity, involving the courts and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the bottom line is that these conventions, while admirable in concept, only add a layer of smoke to the illicit drugs trafficking system. The Bill states that if we choose to arrest the vessel of another convention member, that country's permission is required. Its first option is to repatriate both vessel and crew and in the event that the arrest is found to have been in error, this country will be liable for any damages incurred.</P>
    <P>Anyone found to be in the process of importing drugs into this country should be dealt with by our justice system and serve the sentence imposed by the courts. The ability to serve a sentence in the perpetrator's home jurisdiction should not be possible in cases of drug trafficking. The families and communities affected by the drugs menace deserve better. All of us can give examples of how that menace affects our communities. My constituency is in Dublin and I know that you, Chairman, represent huge population areas, including Finglas. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is in my neighbouring con<Col N="663" />stituency and Deputy Costello, with whom I spoke this morning, represents the inner city. As I said last week, it has been an incredible experience for me as a new Dáil Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches, having the opportunity of interacting with colleagues and sharing experiences. This great menace affects every area and Tallaght is no different from any of the places of which I have spoken. I am sure my colleagues opposite will tell me that Kildare and Waterford are exactly the same.</P>
    <P>The people on the coalface fighting against the scourge of drugs are doing their utmost to undo the problems in their areas and they deserve all the support Dáil Éireann can give them. I hope everybody will support this Bill, despite the reservations I mentioned. We should be clear in our approach. People should not be allowed to profit from the misery of families. Families come to my advice clinics every week with sad stories, detailing the difficult circumstances in which they find themselves. Sometimes it is difficult to help them, but we must try. On a day on which we are to debate Estimates and the economy, it is important that we make it clear to the Government that we must continue to support strongly the social inclusion policies with which we all agree. We must do this for the sake of communities affected by drugs, not only by supporting the programmes and ensuring they continue to prosper, but also by considering, in the context of the Estimates, the provision of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I have a guest with me today from São Paulo in Brazil and I know he has been fascinated by the workings of this House. He was also interested in this Bill when I told him about it. I have expressed some reservations about the impact of the Bill, but I support it as it attempts to reduce further the ability of illicit drugs cartels to undermine our family and community lifestyles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Bill, notwithstanding the fact that it merely gives effect to the Council of Europe agreement and the UN convention it has on board. I agree with all the previous speakers about the ongoing and increasing problem of drug addiction and the need to bring to a halt the activities of those involved in conveying drugs and creating misery for others. There are two elements to the illicit drugs scene &ndash; those who are affected negatively as a result of drug-taking and those who benefit. The target of this legislation is those who benefit. In the past few years we have seen increases in the number of incidents and improved policing, but unfortunately there has also been an increase in the numbers of people involved in drug-taking. All of them will tell, after they have become hooked, of their misery and their anxiety to break the habit. The problem is that before this happens, ruthless people who only want to make more money use other people's misery for their own selfish reasons. No legislation or condem<Col N="664" />nation will affect or change them; they will continue to do as they have always done. It reflects well, however, on the international community that it has at last awakened to the fact that things have been happening on the high seas which can be attended to and that illegal drug traffickers can be apprehended and trafficking discouraged.</P>
      <P>The legislation should be observed by all countries. We know from past experience that international law has a different strength in some countries depending on the jurisdiction. This legislation will operate on the basis of Irish intervention or the intervention of the flag state. I am glad to see that section 22 refers to capital punishment and makes it clear that the Irish State takes precedence and that, in the event of a ship being seized in Irish territorial waters, it would not apply to a person having to return to a country where capital punishment is acceptable.</P>
      <P>All drugs are not conveyed to their final destinations by ship or boat. They have been conveyed in the past by way of a canister or similar container that is dumped off-shore in certain currents and when the tide comes in it is carried on to the shore and is picked up on a pre-arranged signal. This country has a very long shoreline and because of that we have extra responsibilities. It is difficult to police a shoreline of this nature effectively without help from overseas. Some assistance has been given through the European Union to extend existing provisions. That assistance allows for the fact that this country is an EU member state and has been targeted in the past by those involved in drug trafficking and will be targeted in the future to the same extent. In such circumstances, the action taken by the authorities when this legislation is enacted must tackle not only the drugs issue in this country but within the European Union. If we apply this with gusto, we will be doing a good job and will succeed. We cannot equivocate or talk in terms other than those condemning the whole drug trafficking question.</P>
      <P>Recently a hijacker was alleged to have boarded an aeroplane bound for a European destination in another European airport. I do not know why he was carrying a gun on an aeroplane. He may have wanted to do so for self defence purposes, although it would be unusual to travel that way, or it may have been to attack someone else, but the person was released due to lack of evidence. This legislation, as applicable to us, has connotations for our colleagues in other countries in the EU and countries outside of it. It is essential that the spirit and the letter of the law is applied universally. It is of no benefit to us to enforce this legislation if it was to transpire that some other country, a signatory to the Council of Europe agreement or the UN convention, was to ignore some aspect of the law. We would then only go through the motions and we should not be prepared to do that because of the trauma, hardship, misery and death caused by drug traffickers throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" />In the past we have looked at the legislation applying in other European countries with regard to drug trafficking and abuse. The authorities here were not always satisfied that the full rigour of the law was being applied by all who subscribed to it. It would do no harm if the Minister insisted that all of our colleagues within the EU who are signatories to the agreement and the UN convention recognise that they also have responsibilities for the enforcement of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the fact that the UN is silent on the consequences of shared jurisdiction. That can lead to interesting and unclear situations whereby the whole purpose of this exercise would be called into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and hope it is effective, that it is vigorously and rigorously enforced and that it is embraced equally by all signatories, including those outside the European Union and those who have not signed the UN convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND" hpid="Dr. Cowley Dr. Cowley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from the west coast, I am aware of the potential for drug smuggling by sea.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Council of Europe Agreement on Illicit Traffic by Sea. The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, already gives effect in Irish law to the convention but the convention is silent on the consequences of shared jurisdiction, in particular on which state ought to prosecute in such circumstances. The Council of Europe agreement seeks to establish an agreed method of dealing with such a situation by giving the flag state, the state where the ship is registered, preferential jurisdiction where the ship has been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking on the high seas.</P>
      <P>Section 22, which deals with capital punishment, provides that the Minister shall refuse the request for surrender from a convention state which is party to the agreement where the offence for which the person is sought is punishable by the death sentence in their country, unless the Minister receives satisfactory assurances that the death penalty will not be carried out. As a doctor I cannot agree with the death penalty, but how many deaths is a drug trafficker responsible for every day? I am glad to support any measure that will deal with the terrible scourge of drug trafficking, the effects of which are clearly visible on our streets. What parent in the State is not concerned about drugs and the terrible toll they inflict on families across the country.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder Ireland is such a soft touch for drug dealers when according to the Naval Service estimate, given as evidence during the <i>Brime</i> drugs trial in 1994, a drug trafficker has a 20 times greater chance of travelling undetected to Europe through Irish waters? This legislation is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my previous incarnation as a GP I used to go out to Clare Island, a beautiful island any time of the year but particularly in summer, and see <Col N="666" />the lighthouse at the far end of the island perched on a cliff which looked over the broad Atlantic ocean. It was very isolated. In the past a lighthouse keeper lived there with his family. The lighthouse that replaced the Clare Island lighthouse on Achill Beg is also deserted due to automation of lighthouses. The man who used to keep the lighthouse fire burning was an unofficial coast watch minding our terrain. Given that there are 2,700 miles of coastline, that is a great deal of coastline to be watched. More than 90% of our trade is by sea, yet only a handful of the 900 landing points have harbour policing, not to mention surveillance, or any offshore method of watching what is going on. When one considers that many of the beaches in Counties Mayo, Donegal, Sligo, Kerry and Cork cannot be approached by public roads, it may well be that people have knowledge of these locations and can easily land illicit drugs or whatever. With GPS it is possible for ships to drop any type of container under the water with an anchor and the GPS reading can tell anybody the location. It is clear from this that it is easy to traffic in drugs and the profits are great.</P>
    <P>According to the RACO, the representative association of commissioned officers, naval committee, Ireland's control capability in 2000 was the equivalent of less than two Garda cars for the entire island of Ireland. Two Garda cars on Clare Island would probably be enough, but two Garda cars overseeing the whole of Ireland is a laugh. Is it any wonder the Customs national drugs team warned that less than half of the total amount of drugs passing through Irish waters is detected? The level of trafficking is on the increase and could double over the next 20 years. The amount seized is only a percentage of what is actually there, only an estimated 35% of the amount dispatched to Europe from north Africa and South America. The international trade in narcotics is estimated to be worth at least £175 billion sterling and is second only to the arms industry in terms of the global scale.</P>
    <P>Ireland, because of its location on the west of Europe, is a wonderful location for drug traffickers and is the sea route to Europe for cocaine from South America and cannabis from north Africa and the Caribbean.</P>
    <P>The number of seizures at all these isolated places tells the story, but how much more is going on that we know nothing about? Drug trafficking is terrorism of the highest order. It is modern day terrorism that attacks the core of society. I support any measure that can be used to bring those people to justice and to punish them severely because of the havoc they wreak on people's lives. I see the damage done as a GP, as do my colleagues. Anything we can do to stamp out the ravage of drugs should be done. That is why I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation to all Deputies who have contributed to this debate. In particular, I thank the <Col N="667" />Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Deasy, for his most constructive approach and Deputy Costello for his helpful remarks. I hope the Bill can be enacted quickly so that we can continue to reinforce our commitment in conjunction with our international partners so that no effort will be spared in our attempts to bring drug traffickers to justice wherever they may seek to operate.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, made provision for the United Nations Vienna Convention, and the Council of Europe agreement, which gives rise to this legislation, builds on the Vienna Convention by making provision for the concept of preferential jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Bill may appear somewhat technical but when taken in conjunction with the 1994 Act, enactment of this legislation will bring a certainty to international co-operation in this area which will serve to act as a further deterrent to drug trafficking at sea. This is an excellent example of the Government's commitment to continue the co-operation of recent times with our international partners in the fight against drugs. In Europe and on the broader international stage my officials and I participate in the various fora which aim to provide new solutions to the problems of international drug trafficking and organised crime.</P>
      <P>A new EU strategy was approved by the Council of Europe Union on 27 March 2000 &ndash; Prevention and Control of Organised Crime for the New Millennium &ndash; which will ensure a continued co-ordinated response to tackling organised crime at EU level. The strategy provides the framework for an integrated and multi-disciplinary European strategy to prevent and control organised crime and contains 11 political guidelines and 39 detailed recommendations on the prevention and control of organised crime. The EU action plan on drugs was endorsed by the European Council in June 2000. It sets out detailed measures to achieve the objectives and targets in relation to tackling the supply and demand for drugs set out in the EU drug strategy which was endorsed by the European Council in December 1999.</P>
      <P>At an international level in 2000 Ireland also signed, subject to ratification on behalf of Ireland, the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime and two protocols to the convention, a protocol to suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and a protocol against smuggling of migrants by land, sea or air. This convention is an important milestone in the efforts to combat the threat posed by cross-border crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the borders of the European Union continue to expand further it is imperative that co-operation with the countries of central and eastern Europe is enhanced in the fight against organised crime to defeat our common enemy. Ireland is participating and will continue to participate in the development of EU measures to improve co-operation with these countries. Co-operation at bilateral level is vital. In this context we have <Col N="668" />already signed intergovernmental drugs on organised crime agreements with the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Poland, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Russia. Requests to enter into similar bilateral intergovernmental agreements have been received from a number of other candidate countries and they are being examined.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the commitment and dedication of the members of the Garda Síochána, the customs national drugs team and the Naval Service in the exercise of their duties in the fight against trafficking of drugs in what are often very dangerous circumstances. There must be no safe havens for those who engage in drug smuggling. This Bill will ensure such people, when apprehended, will not be able to exploit any conflict between jurisdictions where states are working in close co-operation to tackle this evil trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello asked for a definition of the word &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. We are trying to ensure we cover everything other than the drugs. We are making the definition as broad as possible. We can discuss this matter in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As regards implementation of this legislation, I would like to put on the record of the House that it is the Government's intention that this legislation be enacted immediately following signature by the President. Regarding the right of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to order the release of a person, there may be some circumstances in which an innocent third party may be aboard a seized vessel and the Minister should have the residual power to order the release of that person if it is found he or she was not involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan asked about the implementation of this legislation by other member states. If other member states do not respond to a notice of jurisdiction then this State will automatically have jurisdiction by default under the legislation. I thank everybody for their constructive approach to this legislation. I hope we can get this Bill through Committee Stage and the Seanad speedily so that we can enhance the powers of the navy, about which Deputy Deasy spoke so eloquently. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Tá an-áthas orm an Bille seo a chur os comhair na Dála and to move the Second Stage debate of the Interpretation Bill, 2000, and to outline its purpose and content.</P>
      <P>Most Acts and statutory instruments contain definition or interpretation provisions. They seek to make the legislation concerned more coherent by reducing the need for repetition. They also allow legislation to be shorter and improve clarity. Some interpretation matters arise time and again in legislation. Because of their general application, these have from time to time been gathered together and included in an interpretation Act, which is then applied to all subsequent Acts and statutory instruments. In addition, general rules for interpretation of legislation have been developed by the courts over the years and continue to be developed. They form the part of the law that is called judge-made law or the common law. These general rules have often been given statutory effect, sometimes with improved clarity, in interpretation Acts.</P>
      <P>Most jurisdictions have some sort of general interpretation enactment that applies to its written laws. These general interpretation enactments provide a means of setting out rules that govern how the provisions of its written law are to be construed and include defined terms that are commonly used. The first general interpretation Act was the Interpretation Act, 1889. Its purpose was twofold: to simplify the reading of statute law by deleting from each statute and statutory instrument standard definitions and phrases and to improve the clarity of legislation by giving statutory effect to certain standard principles of statutory interpretation developed by the courts. These remain the key purposes of any interpretation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from minor amending Acts, major Interpretation Acts were enacted in 1889, 1923 and 1937. The Bill proposes to repeal and replace all of the former Interpretation Acts except the Interpretation (Amendment) Act, 1997. That Act deals with the enactment of statutes which abolish common law offences and is left as a stand-alone Act as it is not relevant to the interpreta<Col N="670" />tion of most Acts. Spent and obsolete provisions, such as definitions that are no longer applicable to the interpretation of legislation are not being re-enacted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The last major Interpretation Act was enacted in 1937. That it has stood the test of time is indicative of its success. However, a new Interpretation Act is necessary to deal with changing circumstances, including constitutional and statutory developments since 1937. It is also necessary for four other reasons. First, to provide new definitions to terms frequently used nowadays in statutes and statutory instruments; second, to consolidate provisions that have been added by Interpretation (Amendment) Acts since 1937; third, to modernise the language used in the Interpretation Act and, fourth, to take account of developments in statutory interpretation by the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill further simplifies the matter for those who have recourse to the Interpretation Act. The practice of having to examine one of three sets of Interpretation Acts, depending on the date of passing of the Act to be interpreted, will not be necessary. Because of the proposed repeal of all previous Interpretation Acts relating to statute law, the new definitions, which are set out in the second part of the Schedule to the Bill, will apply only to Acts and statutory instruments made after the Bill is enacted and comes into operation. The Bill also contains safeguard provisions to prevent the application of a reworded definition if it causes legal anomalies or absurdities when being applied to an existing Act or statutory instrument. The safeguard provisions also preserve the effect of obsolete definitions that have been omitted from the new Act.</P>
    <P>Apart from the standard preliminary and general part, Part 1, the Bill is divided into five other parts. Part 2 is new and includes miscellaneous rules to assist in interpreting enactments. Part 3, dealing with citation, operation and commencement of enactments, reflects current law but clarifies a number of matters in that law. Part 4 and the Schedule deal with the meaning and construction of words and expressions. Again, it reflects current law but incorporates a large number of new matters and omits obsolete definitions. Part 5, powers and duties, and Part 6, amendment of enactments, in general reflect existing law but in more modern language. The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum accompanying the Bill identifies in detail all the new provisions.</P>
    <P>In July 2000, shortly before this Bill was published, the Law Reform Commission published its consultation paper entitled Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law. In December 2000, the Law Reform Commission published its report on that matter. In the context of the consultation paper and the report, discussions have taken place between the commission and the Attorney General's office, including the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It was indicated to this House on 26 June 2001 by the then Government <Col N="671" />Chief Whip who stated: &ldquo;Aspects of the Report will be reflected at Committee Stage of the Interpretation Bill&rdquo;. Accordingly, I intend moving a series of amendments on Committee Stage to deal with issues arising from the Law Reform Commission's consultation document and report. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude, and that of the Attorney General, to the Law Reform Commission for all of the assistance and help it has provided in this matter.</P>
    <P>An interpretation Act is an invaluable tool for those who draft, use or interpret our laws. It helps by eliminating the need for standard interpretation provisions and definitions to be set out extensively in every new Act and statutory instrument which effectively would clutter up the Statute Book. The absence of general principles of interpretation from each individual Act and statutory instrument allows our laws to be read more easily. It also ensures a coherence of interpretation across the Statute Book that would not otherwise be there. Those who draft, regularly read or interpret our laws can do so with more precision and confidence when the basic rules and definitions of interpretation are of general application, are clearly set out in an Interpretation Act and are well known and understood.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is of a technical nature and of interest primarily to the legal community, I feel it is very important. It will effect a much-needed modernisation and simplification of the language of the rules and definitions found in the former Interpretation Acts and add new rules and definitions. This will have a positive knock-on effect for the drafting and interpretation of our legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this Interpretation Act has the same lifespan as its predecessor. We will not be around if this Bill has as long a life span as the last Act, given that it was enacted in 1889. I welcome the Minister's presentation of the legislation. It is important that we regularly update our procedures and it is necessary to have interpretation, regular review, examination and amendment, where necessary, of legislation. With the passage of time and the build-up of case law arising from legislation, the Law Reform Commission has ample time to make its submissions and to point out the areas where change is needed and where expedition and clarity is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be best to have an annual update instead of the current system. If a review took place on an annual basis which sought to bring to the House a new interpretation Act specifically applicable to the year in question, the Bill would not have to be as broadly based. It would be recent in its examination of the legislation and more receptive to the needs that arise from case law. That would be more effective than consolidation over a number of years. I have often seen, as has the Minister, how a query can arise about the use of language or the meaning or interpretation of the law. That can arise during the normal <Col N="672" />course of the judicial year or because of peculiar circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the need for clarity regarding the law and legislation. It should be mentioned that we dealt not long ago with another Bill modernising the language used in legislative texts. One would have to have considerable time at one's disposal to figure out what the draftsman originally intended when many Bills were first drawn up. That is fine but raises other issues, and the courts or other institutions that apply or interpret the Acts at a later stage may be confused as to what was really meant when the legislation was first produced. That should be recognised in the context of this Bill because interpretation can be affected greatly by the language used.</P>
    <P>When legislation is put through the Houses and comes into force with regulations appended, it may be found that its application is vastly different to what was intended by the draftspersons and the Members of this House in their debate on the Bill. Reference has often been made to debates in this House. I remember working with a well known and eminent public servant who, in order to determine the meaning of a particular Act, would always refer to the debate in the House. You will be glad to know, a Cheann Comhairle, that he at least recognised where the inspiration should come from. He also referred to the Minister's regulations or statutory instruments which can have a huge bearing on the intention of a piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will generate enthusiasm and interest in the updating of the interpretation of legislation and in increasing clarity. I am hopeful that there will be a clear recognition that the interpretation, whatever it may be, should bear some similarity to what was intended when Members spoke in the House, and when they expressed a point of view to accommodate a particular issue. It is important to note that this is a technical Bill to embrace a series of other legislative measures. However, it has wider implications in that it can affect those other measures in a positive or negative way depending on its application.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if the Minister over the next 12 months kept an eye on similar legislation to determine whether the measures being put in place are adequate to meet today's requirements. This may require a more immediate annual or bi-annual response and I am interested to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to clarity and to spent and obsolete provisions and definitions which will no longer be applicable with the introduction of the Bill. That is as it should be as we must move on. There are modern interpretations of the legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and the Oireachtas should be able to respond to current needs. We should not have to wait to be prompted from any quarter. The Oireachtas is where legislation originates and, therefore, it is where we should deal with improvements and the <Col N="673" />creation of a more consumer friendly legislative environment.</P>
    <P>The passage of time and the build-up of interpretations may require an immediate or more long-term response. That is a matter on which the Minister of State might like to comment. I sincerely hope in the case of all general legislation which has come before the House that there can at some time be a provision in the interpretation legislation which takes account of what the original initiators of the legislation appeared to have in mind. If too long a time is allowed to elapse before a review or revision takes place, it is possible for matters to become vague.</P>
    <P>I welcome this technical Bill and hope it has the effect intended. I also hope we are still Members of the House when the next Interpretation Bill is published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was published in 2000 and has taken some time to come before us. I note from the Minister of State's comments that she intends to move a series of amendments on Committee Stage to deal with issues arising from the Law Reform Commission's consultation document and report. To the best of my knowledge, when the Bill was first published the consultation document had been published but not the final report. One of the issues I intended raising in discussing the Bill was the importance of taking on board the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>The most significant innovation in the Bill is that it places on a statutory footing a rule for interpreting statutes. This is set out in section 5 and provides that, where a provision is ambiguous, obscure or on a literal interpretation absurd, or would fail to reflect the plain intention of the Oireachtas, the courts may interpret the Act in accordance with the plain intention of the Oireachtas as derived from the text of the Act as a whole. This sounds reasonable and represents an attempt to move away from the traditional judicial attitude that law-making is an invasion by Parliament into the courts' control of the common law, that every statute should be given a narrow and mean construction and that it is no function of the courts to assist the Legislature by interpreting the laws in a way that makes practical sense or reflects what Parliament intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The common lawyers' attitude of regarding every new statute with suspicion is what has resulted in our style of law-making where every provision is spelled out in laborious detail and every contingency is envisaged and provided for. Nothing is left to chance because, if any difficulty arises, the courts cannot be relied upon to help out. The traditional view has been that the Oireachtas knows what it is doing, knows the meaning of the words it uses and that the courts should therefore base their interpretation on the words used in their ordinary meaning. Second-guessing, along the lines of &ldquo;they could not possibly have meant that, they must have meant this&rdquo; is not considered a judicial function. In fact, it is <Col N="674" />seen as being a usurpation of the legislative function.</P>
    <P>Depending on one's point of view, this is either a triumph of legal form over the dictates of justice and common sense, or an insistence on the basic principle that, regardless of the outcome in certain cases, law should be written so that it is predictable and certain rather than being made up as we go along.</P>
    <P>Arguably, the new provision represents a shift of power from the Oireachtas to the courts. The Oireachtas is presumed not to know what it is doing whenever there is an obscurity, ambiguity or absurdity or, more generally, when the words used do not reflect the plain intention of the Oireachtas as ascertained from the Act taken as a whole. There is no proposal to use Dáil and Seanad debates. The courts can now fill in the gaps.</P>
    <P>Opponents would argue that this is a licence for judicial legislation. They would say that, in principle, if one believes in the sovereignty of Parliament under the constitutional separation of powers, the rational cure for any defect in an Act should be an amending Act. They would query whether a self-respecting Parliament should pass a Bill to give the courts power to decide that the literal interpretation of that Parliament's enactments should be departed from if they think this is necessary to give effect to an implied but unstated intention of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The alternative view, arguably more realistic, is that the detail and complexity of much modern legislation is such that the average legislator does not even attempt to get to grips with it, especially if it outside his or her own brief or area of interest. In this view, Deputies and Senators are not so much the authors of legislation as bystanders, with only limited capacity to intervene and listen to a conversation taking place between the Executive, via its draftsman, and the law courts. There is something slightly bogus about grandiloquent references to &ldquo;the intention of the Oireachtas&rdquo; in passing a specific statute. There is also something unattractive about a system of justice which places a premium on the ability of legal advocates to spot defects in legislation that can be exploited to their clients' advantage.</P>
    <P>Specific points arise from this provision. One is that it should be made clear whether the Bill is intended to cut across another traditional principle or to abolish it, namely, that of strict construction of penal statutes. In other words, a criminal law or some other law which trespasses upon major legal rights should be read literally. If the State wants to put someone in prison, it must do so in clear language. This is a significant protection for human rights and is in line with the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights that a person should have proper notice of the criminal laws.</P>
    <P>Another point is that it should also be queried whether the placing of this principle of interpretation on a statutory footing is intended to give rise <Col N="675" />to the presumption that other canons of statutory construction, some of more respectable vintage but which have not been so elevated, are being effectively abolished.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the new Bill, including the principle of construction, would apply to all laws whenever enacted, including laws enacted under different presumptions as to the rules of statutory interpretation. Can we be sure that the interpretation of statutes would not be affected, even where their interpretation has been previously argued and there is now well settled law on the question?</P>
    <P>The Statute of Uses, 1634, as interpreted, and only as interpreted, is the cornerstone of the modern law of trusts. On any other interpretation than the one the courts have given it, the edifice falls apart. The specific purpose of that statute was to execute every trust and thereby pass full legal and beneficial title to a person vested with property to hold in trust for another. Despite this, that statute has deliberately been interpreted in a way that wilfully fails to give effect to the intention of its promoters. Presumably, the passing of new interpretation legislation is not intended to re-open a question that was resolved almost 400 years ago. One could cite other examples.</P>
    <P>There is also the point about including the issues raised by the report of the Law Reform Commission. I have already raised that with the Minister of State and I add it to the list of points I have made.</P>
    <P>The Interpretation (Amendment) Act, 1997 is not included in this legislation and the Minister of State referred to this fact. She said it was not included because it is a stand-alone issue. Is it also being excluded because it was questioned in the High Court and subsequently in an appeal to the Supreme Court?</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Schedule lists only a further eight expressions which the draftsman considers are so commonly used in statutes, invariably with the same definition, that their definition can be set out once and for all in the Interpretation Act rather than being repeated in every statute in which the expression arises. Is there some reason in principle that the list could not be added to? I imagine there are more than that number of expressions commonly used and repeatedly defined in different legislation. Examples would be &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Central Bank&rdquo;, &ldquo;contravention&rdquo;, &ldquo;enactment&rdquo; and so on. A number of terms are defined in different legislation.</P>
    <P>The central question I raise apart from the other more minor ones is whether the supreme makers of law are the legislators or the courts who interpret the law. It is important that we do not hand over too many of our powers to the courts. It is primarily our responsibility as legislators to make laws and write them as clearly as we possibly can so that the courts can interpret them rather than re-interpret them.</P>
    <P>Obviously a number of amendments will be tabled by the Government and others on Com<Col N="676" />mittee Stage and this will give an opportunity to tease out these areas. They are important in terms of the separation of powers between the Legislature and the Judiciary. We will also table amendments on Committee Stage on other technical issues.</P>

      <P>This is a complex, technical and legalistic Bill which is challenging for anyone other than a trained lawyer. There is no queue of speakers waiting for time on this Bill and I am not surprised. My party and I support a proposal that would be valuable and progressive, especially in the context of legislation such as this. The proposal is that consideration should be given to the establishment of an office of law officer to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The chief legal adviser of the government under the Constitution is the Attorney General. In recent years we have heard repeated calls for the opinion of the Attorney General and his advice to the Government on various matters of public importance to be published. These calls have generally been met with refusals from the Government, which is regrettable. In most cases there is no reason why such advice should not be made public. The role of the Attorney General is primarily to advise the Government on legal matters and he is not directly answerable to this House. As legislators we need an officer in the Houses who would be available to advise Members, and it is obvious that all Members would require this assistance, on the full legal implications of legislation and other matters with which we must deal. This would enhance our role as law makers and as representatives of the public interest. I make this point in the context of this Bill which is concerned with the interpretation of legislation. It is something all Members of this House and the Seanad should consider and support and I urge the Minister to take it on board.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the Bill as presented. It is a sane and sensible measure which should facilitate both the legislative and judicial process. Anything which contributes, even in a small way, to the simplification of the legal process and that makes it more expeditious is welcome. We have a long way to go in that regard. The legislative and legal systems need to be opened up and made more accessible to citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to echo some of the comments of my colleague, an Teachta Aengus Ó Snodaigh, when he spoke on the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill. Labhair sé ar stadas na Gaeilge ó thaobh reachtaíochta de. Is scannal é nach bhfuil reachtaíocht ar fáil i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla. Ba chóir go mbeadh cothromaíocht ann idir Béarladóirí agus Gaeilgeoirí. Tá sin sa Bhunreacht ach ní chuirtear i bhfeidhm é. Legislation <Col N="677" />could and should be published in both Irish and English. This should include Bills, statutory instruments and Acts of the Oireachtas. The laws of the State should be made available in both languages simultaneously. The State has gone backwards in this regard since the practice of simultaneous translation was ended in 1980.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ó Beoláin <i>v.</i> Fahy last year the Supreme Court condemned the failure of the State to provide official Irish translations of laws. I remind the Minister and the House of what Mr. Justice Hardiman said. He said that the current situation was &ldquo;an offence to the letter and spirit of the Constitution&rdquo;. The Government and the Oireachtas are in dereliction of their constitutional duty towards the Irish language and the Irish language community. We should give the lead on this. Not just the legislation but the explanatory memorandum and all the associated material is in English only.</P>
    <P>I understand that at present there is a 20 year gap between publication of the Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments in English and their translation into Irish. This is farcical but serious. It is unacceptable and it must be addressed and reversed in the context of the forthcoming Official Languages (Equality) Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the points I have raised will be taken into account although they come at somewhat of a tangent to the legislation before us. Most importantly, they are relevant points to this House and its role. I look forward to further elucidation on this legislation on Committee and Report Stages and hope to have another opportunity then to raise some of the important matters which have been referred to.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom bhuíochas a ghabháil don Teachta Ó Caoláin as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. This Bill is technical and seems limited in its interest and directed at those in the legal profession. It is interesting to take stock as a Parliament of how the interpretation of Acts has progressed down the years. It is interesting also to hear the Minister talk about the various years in which we have had previous Interpretation Acts, in 1937, 1923 and 1889. I have been looking back before that at what I might also call Interpretation Acts and I will mention them shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard 1937 mentioned it struck me as a historic year in the development of Parliament and our laws. The Constitution came into being in that year. Mar gheall ar Airteagal 8 sa Bhunreacht, tá suim faoi leith agam agus ag go leor daoine eile sa Teach sa stadas a thugtar don Ghaeilge. Bhí an stadas sin ann ó 1922 faoi Bhunreacht an Saorstáit ach ag féachaint siar ar bhealach, is léir gur botún a bhí ann sa Bhunreacht 1937 nach raibh an foráil maidir leis an Ghaeilge <Col N="678" />i bhfoirm chirt; dearbhú a bhí inti. Fágann sin a lán daoine míshásta leis an bhéalchráifeacht faoin teanga. Tá muid ag dul siar i ndáiríre ó thaobh cur ar fáil reachtaíochta sa dhá theanga agus dátheangathas a chur ar fáil do shaoránaigh na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart dúinn athbhreithneamh a dhéanamh agus gníomhú de reir an Bhrunreacht mar tá seo soléir in Airteagal 8º:</P>
    <P>1. Ós í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta is í an phríomhtheanga oifigiúil í.</P>
    <P>2. Glactar leis an Sacs-Bhéarla mar theanga oifigiúil eile.</P>
    <P>3. Ach féadfar socrú a dhéanamh le dlí [agus tá muid ag caint mar gheall ar dhlí anseo] d'fhonn ceachtar den dá theanga sin a bheith ina haonteanga le haghaidh aon ghnó nó gnóthaí oifigiúla ar fud an Stáit ar fad nó in aon chuid de.</P>
    <P>Is léir nach féidir a rá go bhfuil deis ag an bpobal gníomhú de reir Airteagail 8.3º. Is ceist sin do na cúirteanna freisin ach de bharr nach bhfuil cearta luaite sa mBunreacht, tá leisce ar go leor daoine dul os comhair na cúirte. Tá ról faoi leith ag an Rialtas sin a cheartú agus ba cheart á dhéanamh roimh i bhfad.</P>
    <P>Idir an dá linn, áfach, tá muid ag leanúint ar aghaidh ag caint ar an gcuspóir mar a bhí sé i bhfreagra Dála i 1988, nuair a dúradh linn gur cuspóir náisiúnta é an Ghaeilge a athbheochaint agus go bhfuil tacaíocht leanúna tugtha don aidhm sin ag Rialtais éagsúla thar na blianta. Is beag tacaíocht atá ann i ndáiríre má tá muid ag caint fá aitheantas a thabhairt nó cupla rud deas a rá anois is arís. Ní féidir a rá go bhfuil athbheochán ar bun.</P>
    <P>It is quite interesting to see how Irish law has developed and how it was before that. After the Elizabethan Wars and the flight of the earls in 1607, we could probably say we had English law in this country. What we are talking about now is a development and legacy mainly from those times. More recently it has been modernised out of all recognition to the Elizabethans.</P>
    <P>The book, &ldquo;A Guide to Early Irish Law&rdquo; by Fergus Kelly from the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, gives a sense of heritage and longevity to what we are discussing. It mentions somebody who could be seen as a legal officer, but not to the Oireachtas, in 1602. He was known as a Brehon and his name was Patrick McEgan of Corbeg, County Longford. One could say he was appointed a law officer and his role was that he had licence to &ldquo;prosecute and punish by all means, malefactors, rebels, vagabonds, rhymers, Irish harpers, idle men and women and other unprofitable members&rdquo;. Clearly things have changed and I hope Irish harpers are not considered in that category any more, whatever about rhymers.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note how some issues do not change that much. I hear many people bemoaning the fact that shops are open on Sundays, which <Col N="679" />have become quite secular and seem to be considered no different from any other weekday. Before the Elizabethan Wars in Brehon times it is interesting to read the Cáin Domhnaigh, which is the Sunday law. It says:</P>
    <P>The treatment of the offence of working on a Sunday relies on principles, which have been unable to discern in other law text and they are: the offender not only pays a fine for working on a Sunday of four dry heifers, but also forfeits whatever clothing and other property, including a horse, which he may have with him at the time of the offence. The witness who takes legal action against him is entitled to receive half the fine.</P>
    <P>In no other law text are witnesses offered such a strong inducement to come forward. Cáin Domhnaigh is correspondingly severe on the witness who fails to report a violation of Sunday who had to pay as heavy a fine as the offender himself. There is clearly a change of emphasis today. I am sure the courts would be bulging if there were any revisitation of that law.</P>
    <P>If we were to look at O'Connell Street, Dublin, on a Sunday there might also be a need to look at the law governing damage to trees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It says &ldquo;to cut trees is counted as human trespass&rdquo; although it does not state whether someone has to be living in the tree at the time. It states:</P>
      <P>Trees and shrubs are organised into four groups of seven in accordance with their economic importance. The fine due for cutting one of the most valuable trees, the seven nobles of the forest, is five sets. The culprit also has to make restitution. If he cuts a branch, this is a yearling heifer; if he cuts a fork or a large limb, this is a two-year-old heifer; and if he cuts the tree at the base, this is a milch cow.</P>
      <P>Dublin City Council would need quite a herd available to it to pay the penalty on that offence.</P>

      <P>During the debate on <Col N="680" />this Bill, it was mentioned that when passing legislation people might be forced to look at the substance of the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas to interpret it. I hope nobody in future tries to interpret from our debate this afternoon what exactly is meant by the Interpretation Bill, judging by the range of topics we have discussed here. Were people to interpret any legislation, the written word could never capture the enthusiasm, strength of voice and vigour that can be demonstrated by some Members in this House. That, of course, would all be lost in the interpretation of just the written word, which is why it is important to have legislation like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It could say the Member was very enthusiastic about this proposal, which is the importance of having an Interpretation Bill. It will become an Act that will be of particular benefit to lawyers and those interpreting legislation. It should not be the case that people in this House feel it is outside their remit or capability to be able to discuss it. Our job is to be national legislators. We have to prepare legislation, making sure it includes the policy for which we stand and then make it available to the people in such a way that it can be applied. Any legislation we introduce to assist that is obviously important. Taken in tandem with the restatement Bill, which was introduced a few months ago, it shows the need not only to simplify and update the law, but also to update the interpretation of it.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed. Deputy Durkan spoke about the need for an annual Interpretation Act but amendments are sufficient as the need arises. Interpretations do not change that often. If one examines the list of words that are defined and explained in the legislation, one wonders why they are being explained at all because they are in regular use. They interpret and define what a week is &ndash; some people start it on a Monday, others on Sunday morning. It defines what a Minister of State is. I do not know whether it is possible or necessary to define what a Deputy is but then who could? We are all so different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It even goes so far as to define what swearing is, so it makes one wonder regarding the words that have been chosen. However, for the purposes of law, it will simplify matters for those who use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for her learned address and the questions she raised. We will be able to refer to some of those important matters on Committee Stage. She asked why the Interpretation Act, 1997, was excluded. The reason is because it relates to unwritten law not to statute law, so it is not relevant in this case. She asked <Col N="681" />why some terms were defined and not others, particularly the word &ldquo;enactment&rdquo;. I understand the word can have different meanings concerning different matters. For instance, it can refer to the Constitution in some contexts but not in others. It does not have a general application so it was not included. The Statute of Uses of 1634 pre-dates the Interpretation Acts of 1893, 1923 and 1937 and, as indicated in my speech, this Bill will not impose new interpretations on existing acts. I note the significant number of issues that the Law Reform Commission raised and I will be examining those on Committee Stage when we can debate them fully.</P>
    <P>Don dara huair sa Teach seo tá muid ag caint faoi thábhacht na Gaeilge agus an tábhacht ag baint le reachtaíocht a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge. Glacaim go hiomlán leis. Tá bearna fada ann idir reachtaíocht a bheith ar fáil i mBéarla agus ansin i nGaeilge. Dúirt an Teachta Ó Caoláin 20 bliain; ar a laghad tá 10 mbliain ann. Tá aistritheoirí nua, áfach, tar éis bheith fostaithe sa Teach chun na hoibre seo a dhéanamh. Aontaím gur chóir do dhaoine a gcearta a bheith ar fáil sna cúirteanna ach tá súil agam nach gá d'achan duine a gcearta i nGaeilge agus iad os comhair na cúirte. Ba chóir go mbeadh daoine in ann Gaeilge a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go bhfeiceann an saol lasmuigh go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt sa Teach seo ná mar a bhí le blianta anuas. Tá neart Teachtaí le Gaeilge agus tá formhór díofa sásta a gcuid a úsáid ach, faraoir, ní fhaighimid mórán poiblíochta mar gheall air sin. Sin a fáth nach labhrann an-chuid daoine Gaeilge. Ní gá a bheith ag feithimh le reachtaíocht ná dhul os comhair na cúirte chun na Gaeilge a úsáid. Ní féidir linn ach dea-shampla a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Tá Bille na Gaeilge ag teacht ar aghaidh. Tá an tAire Ó Cúív tar éis an Bhille sin a chur ag barr an liosta reachtaíochta a chur os comhair na Dála agus beimid ag obair air go luath. Cuirfear fáilte roimhe agus nuair a chuirfear os comhair an Tí é agus beidh an-dhíospóireacht againn ar an Ghaeilge i gcoitinne. Tá a fhios againn uilig cad é atá le déanamh.</P>

    <P>The translation of the Bills is one thing, legislation is another. It is significant, in the context of making legislation, that today we have passed the Second Stage of three Bills in this House. Despite all the other work which is going on &ndash; including the valuable debates on tribunals of inquiry and the Book of Estimates next week &ndash; we can still legislate. This is the job we are elected <Col N="682" />to do. We will continue to introduce legislation into the House and to consider our ideas carefully on Committee Stages.</P>
    <P>With the Interpretation Bill, 2000, we must ensure that those who go on to use it can understand what is meant by it. It is a legal document so the contribution of the Law Reform Commission is valuable and greatly appreciated because we need the views of the users of legislation. I look forward to taking this Bill to Committee Stage which will be taken in the same committee as the Restatement Bill, so the Bills will be backed onto each other at the finance committee. Perhaps those Deputies who contributed so ably here, including Deputy O'Sullivan, can raise their amendments and suggestions there. I thank Deputies for their consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of measures to improve teacher supply have been introduced in recent years. The intake to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically. Since 1999, more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the undergraduate B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. Since 1996, postgraduate diploma courses have been run by the colleges of education to increase further the number of B.Ed graduates. In February 2002, 461 students commenced the postgradu<Col N="683" />ate course and these students will graduate in June 2003. A further post-graduate course will commence in February 2003. The number of students to be admitted to that course is being finalised with the colleges of education.</P>
    <P>A total of 1,633 students completed the postgraduate course between 1996 and 2002. As outlined, the total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are some 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. Between 2002 and 2003, it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>My Department is examining the feasibility of providing a modular type course for second level trained teachers teaching in primary schools, who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and the necessary academic requirement in Irish. This proposal will be discussed with the colleges of education in the near future and, if implemented, would enable these teachers to become fully qualified primary teachers. As well as increasing the number of student places in the colleges of education, my Department has introduced a range of initiatives to address the current shortage of qualified teachers. B. Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who study Irish to honours level as an academic subject are now recognised as fully qualified. In addition, primary degree holders with the Higher Diploma in Education are now paid on the trained salary scale in respect of temporary teaching service. Teachers trained in EU countries are also paid at the trained rate for up to five years pending attainment of the necessary competence in Irish, while teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department are granted the same provisional recognition as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, those who successfully complete the three year Montessori course in St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, that is recognised by the NCEA, and those who attain the Montessori qualification on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI college are recognised as fully qualified for substitute teaching. Such teachers are also fully recognised for teaching service in certain categories of special schools and classes where Irish is not a requirement on the curriculum. Fully qualified teachers trained outside the State are also fully recognised to teach in these categories of schools and classes. I am confident the measures outlined above are contributing significantly to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. I am committed to ensuring the existing shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated in the next two to three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions outlined by the Minister, which go some way towards addressing the problem. However, while teachers are coming in at one end of the system, some are also going out at the other end and there is a serious problem with regard to retention of primary school teachers. The reality is that 30,000 to 40,000 pupils in primary schools in Ireland are not being taught by qualified teachers and half of that number are being taught by unqualified people. That is not acceptable. Those most affected are people in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In view of the statement by the INTO that its members will refuse to teach in the schools concerned if the problem is not sorted out by 2005, is the Minister confident that all primary school pupils in this country will be taught by qualified teachers by then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is not acceptable to have a shortage of primary school teachers but such situations are not changed overnight. I have quoted the figures for graduations in 1995 and 1996 was not much better because of decisions taken at that time. I have also outlined what has been happening since then and I am confident that, by 2005, notwithstanding the Deputy's point with regard to teachers leaving the system, we will reach our objective. If the INTO continues to insist on going on strike in 2005 and if I am not satisfied there will be sufficient qualified teachers, other aspects may have to be looked at, such as the number of teachers out of the system on career breaks or secondment. However, with the measures I have outlined, I believe the number of graduates should meet the needs by 2005. As the Deputy will be aware, the number of pupils attending primary schools is beginning to level out at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the steps outlined by the Minister to increase graduate numbers and to enable more qualified primary teachers to come on stream. In view of the Minister's comment that such developments do not happen overnight, is he aware of a report published in December 2000 by the Joint Committee on Education and Science on the availability of teaching staff in primary schools? That report, for which the rapporteur was Deputy Sargent, made 28 recommendations on measures to help ensure an adequate supply of recognised teachers in Irish primary schools. While there has been some movement, such as in relation to Montessori teachers, the INTO requires conversion courses for three year Montessori teachers. Is the Minister aware of recommendation No. 9 with regard to greater availability of conversion courses for graduates or those with teaching experience, using distance learning technology? That would allow people to achieve the required standard on a cost effective basis. Has the Minister considered another recommendation concerning the use of retired staff with specific qualifications, such as music, to fill some of the vacancies? In view of <Col N="685" />the Minister's recent statement about a special fund for teachers in disadvantaged areas, what are his plans in that regard and in relation to the other recommendations in the report to which I have referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has recognised, many of the recommendations in the report were implemented or are in the course of implementation. The question of a conversion course is still subject to discussion with unions and has neither been ruled out nor ruled in at this stage. With regard to some of the other suggestions on retired teachers etc, our approach is to try to ensure there are sufficient qualified teachers in all classes over the next two to three years. Our main focus has been on increasing the number of people becoming qualified as primary teachers and that approach will be maintained. If it appears a few years from now that we may not reach the target, other measures will be looked at and the use of retired teachers would be one of the options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG" hpid="Ms Enright Ms Enright">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In trying to reach the targets, has the Minister considered recruiting more men into the system? In last years figures for the teacher training colleges, female student teachers out-numbered male student teachers by nine to one. Will gender balance in the system be looked at in the context of the measures outlined by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to introduce an incentive to ensure the retention of qualified teachers in disadvantaged areas, which tend to have the highest leakage levels? Disadvantaged areas have the highest leakage levels and the proposal for an extra salary allowance would be welcomed. Does the Minister plan to introduce this soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to avoid this but there is a question on this subject later. I repeat what I said. There is a problem retaining teachers in disadvantaged areas. We are doing research to see how great the problem is. It needs to be addressed because, as those of us who have teaching experience know, the longer a teacher is <i>in situ</i> the more he or she builds up trust and rapport with children from the area. That is particularly true in a disadvantaged area. I want to do something about it. The Deputy will be aware that a forum on disadvantage will be convened next Monday. I am sure that this will be one of the issues it will address.</P>
      <P>I did not particularly focus on extra pay or extra wages. There are other incentives which can be put in place. The most significant problem faced by teachers in disadvantaged areas is burn-out because of the intensity of the work. Many of the teachers who work in these areas do so out of a sense of vocation and may face burn-out more quickly. I would like to leave the options on incentives as open as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" />Deputy Enright raised the point about gender balance in teacher training. This has not happened overnight but has been a trend for a number of years. I understand from recollection that this year and last year the balance has slightly tilted back. I do not think that I can pursue sexist policies on entrance to teacher training.</P>

      <Quest>if the funds gained by the 69% increase in college registration charges constitute an additional investment in education; if it is merely a mechanism to compensate for cuts in funding from tax revenue; if funding from registration fees or the possible reintroduction of third level fees will be ring fenced for investment in education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The charge referred to by the Deputy is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services. The increase in the charge brings the amount contributed by students more into line with the cost of providing these services. The effect on funding for individual third level institutions is cost neutral this year.</P>
      <P>Students who are eligible for means-tested student support will, in addition to any grant they are entitled to, have the &euro;670 charge paid on their behalf, either directly by my Department or through the local authorities and vocational education committees. This means that 34% of students in universities and 47% of students in institutes of technology will not have to pay the charge.</P>
      <P>The increase in the charge should be viewed in the context of an overall package of measures that I announced earlier this year aimed at increasing and improving the student support schemes for the 2002-03 academic year. In the current financial year the Government will spend over &euro;360 million on student supports, including free fees.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost per student of providing third level education in the current academic year will exceed &euro;6,000 for arts, law and business courses, &euro;8,000 for science courses and &euro;9,000 for engineering and medicine. The contribution from students has to be seen in light of these figures.</P>
      <P>As regards free fees, I am conducting a review of student support provisions aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised in the context of the Government's objectives of achieving greater access to third level education among lower socio-economic groups. The free fees initiative is being considered in the context of that review. My aim is to ensure that the available funding is targeted in a manner that achieves the maximum impact from the point of view of equity of access to third level education.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that any collection of third level fees would be ring-fenced. Does the Minister believe that the introduction of third level fees is the most effective way to create funding for third level, second level and primary education? What does he think of the idea of using some of the special savings incentive scheme, dropping the tax benefits on fee-paying schools or even a ring-fenced income tax? Given the pressures that his Department is facing, would the Minister be willing to suggest these alternatives to the Minister for Finance in advance of the budget although the Estimates have already been produced?</P>

      <P>All of those types of suggestions are open for consideration in the review which is now being carried out. I have no set view other than the one I have consistently stated, that I do not believe that free fees for the rich who can afford third level education is a reasonable expenditure while so many constituents cannot afford to get near to third level. This is why I am having the review. A number of people have made suggestions for consideration. The Deputy has adverted to some of them. Some newspaper reports have proposed a payment after the completion of the third level course. I am open to any suggestion but it must be on the basis of the envelope of money that I have and that the disadvantaged take priority over those who can already enter the system.</P>

      <P>I agree with the noble suggestion that we should have free education for all and I would have no difficulty in extending free education to everyone if we had great wealth. We have not reached that stage. When a Minister is constrained by budgets, even if the amount of <Col N="688" />money given for student supports is &euro;360 million, it is incumbent on him or her, as a representative of the people, to ensure that the money benefits as many people as possible. I have said this on numerous occasions to student leaders I met in various colleges. When I explained to them what I am doing in the review they have no difficulty with it. In my days as a student, and even prior to that, the slogan was, &ldquo;Education is a right, not a privilege&rdquo;. I still adhere to that slogan from my USI days. It is all right to talk like that when one is in the middle and upper middle income groups but it is nothing more than a slogan to people in certain areas of Dublin where 7% attend third level education at a struggle.</P>
      <P>One of the factors I have to consider in relation to the possible re-introduction of free fees is that I have noticed in recent years that well-off people who can afford third level education have benefited from not having to pay fees. There is evidence to suggest that the various schemes that have been introduced in the past three or four years to address disadvantage among lower socio-economic groups have increased&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Educational Welfare Board was established on an interim or designate basis at the end of May 2001 and held its first meeting on 15 June 2001. The board was set up on an interim basis to allow it to prepare and plan for the introduction of a new educational welfare service. The post of chief executive was advertised in November 2001 and interviews were held in early 2002. A person considered suitable by the board was offered the appointment and he accepted it. He notified the board very shortly before he was due to take up the post, however, that he was not going to do so. This gave rise to a difficult situation, which the board attempted to address by appointing an interim chief executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board was placed on a full statutory footing on 4 March 2002, through the commencement of certain sections of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. All sections of the Act were commenced from 5 July this year. The board is fully established as an independent body and is com<Col N="689" />prised of people representing school management, teachers, parents, the school attendance service, the voluntary sector and a number of Departments involved in child welfare matters. It is recruiting staff for its head office, including senior management. The board has advertised these posts and the selection process is under way. In addition, the Act provided that school attendance officers become staff of the board and this cohort of staff now works to the board. Including senior posts, this inherited cohort of staff totals 36 in number. These members of staff have been authorised by the board to carry out a range of school attendance duties.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has provided no details of the newspaper reports of a court case referred to in her question. As a general rule, however, I do not consider it appropriate to comment on court proceedings in particular cases, especially where a case might be ongoing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. While I appreciate the unforeseen industrial difficulties that have been faced by the board in its attempts to appoint a chief executive officer, I put it to the Minister that there has been undue delay in relation to the appointment of education welfare officers, whose job it will be to ensure that children go to school. Does the Minister agree that, when we discuss children who drop out of school at an early age or do not attend school, we are talking about the most vulnerable children in the State? I am sure the Minister agrees that a small number of children in our constituencies are at risk of dropping out of school and getting involved in crime at an early age. The early intervention of education welfare officers could make the difference between a life of work and productivity and a life of crime for such children.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it has been reported that 30% of pupils in certain deprived areas do not attend school? Can he give the House an approximate date for the appointment of the education welfare officers in all parts of the country? The officers that are in place are those that serve parts of Dublin, Cork and Waterford &ndash; there are none in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>The case to which I referred in my initial question referred to a 14 year old boy who could not return to school. A judge described this situation as &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; when he realised that, after ordering a report from the National Educational Welfare Board to help to get the child back into school, the report could not be produced because the board was not in place. I put it to the Minister that we are failing our most vulnerable young people? The provisions of the 2000 Act are good, but they need to be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. N. Dempsey Mr. N. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, is a good and important Act. The work of the board will be similarly important. I also agree with her that we are talking about vulnerable young people in most, but probably not all, cases of absenteeism. A series of provisions in the Act identifies the causes of absenteeism and early school leaving, as well as safeguarding every child's entitlement to an appropriate minimum education. The Act is designed to develop measures to complement the existing means of preventing the problems I have mentioned. As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, the Act contains certain provisions to support children who are at risk. It is a hugely important Act.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there has been a tendency to believe that the NEWB will force children who are playing truant to go back to school, but the Act provides for some extremely important complementary welfare measures. The board will promote a positive appreciation among students of the benefits to be derived from education. I do not like to see the NEWB constantly described in negative terms as seems to be the case in the newspapers' commentary of it, although I do not suggest that Deputy O'Sullivan did so. I am sure the Deputy is aware that discussions are ongoing in relation to the board and the work of the welfare officers. I assure her that provision has been made in the Estimates for the continuing roll-out of the board into other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department continues to prioritise child protection and the implementation of the stay safe programme in every school. The various elements of the programme &ndash; professional development courses for teachers, parent awareness seminars at individual school level and the teaching of personal safety skills to pupils, continue to be supported. The latest implementation figures which are available date from 1999 to 2000 and indicate that 98.6% of primary schools had participated in professional development courses, 87% of schools had facilitated parent education regarding child protection issues and 74% of schools were teaching the stay safe programme. Training continues for teachers new to the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stay safe programme and the implementation of national child protection guidelines, under the title Children First, continue to receive attention following the introduction of social, personal and health education, or SPHE, as a subject on the revised primary school curriculum. Child <Col N="691" />protection is an integral part of the SPHE curriculum and it is intended that this area of the revised curriculum will be implemented in all schools from September 2003. I do not, therefore, propose to make the stay safe programme mandatory at this stage. All primary teachers have attended a one-day seminar on the SPHE curriculum and a training programme on Children First has been delivered for the nominated person from each school. The team delivering these seminars included two trainers from the stay safe team. It is a priority for my Department to ensure that a high level of awareness and skill to address child protection issues, which includes the implementation of the Stay Safe programme, is maintained. My Department, therefore, will continue to support the promotion of child protection within the context of the SPHE curriculum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG" hpid="Ms Enright Ms Enright">
      <NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there a need for the stay safe programme if the SPHE curriculum is sufficient? It is important that the stay safe programme be made compulsory in all schools, although I appreciate that the Minister and I disagreed on this matter last week when we discussed whether a bullying policy should be mandatory. Has the Minister evaluated the effectiveness of the stay safe programme? One of the most important findings of a survey about the programme some years ago was that children who participate in the programme are much more likely to disclose instances of abuse. If we have learned anything in recent months, it is that it was a great pity that the stay safe programme was not implemented until 1991, although the brave step taken by the Minister of the time is to be praised. I ask the Minister to reconsider his plans not to make the programme mandatory in schools and to deal with the question of its effectiveness.</P>

I will not go back on what I said in regard to making the stay safe programme compulsory but I will look again at her suggestions, particularly the one relating to assessment. I am very keen to have regular assessments of many of the programmes, not just in this area of education, because many of them are implemented on a pilot basis and are not assessed on an ongoing basis. I am satisfied that the revised SPHE curriculum for primary schools will be an effective way forward.</P>

      <P>I will expand the adult literacy service as resources become available. Some &euro;93.5 million was committed to the service in the National Development Plan, 2000-06, with a target of reaching 113,000 clients. Investment in this area has increased 16 fold since 1997 and is already ahead of the levels provided for in the national development plan. The funds are being used to expand the scale and scope of provision, improve outreach and referral links and promote flexibility and quality. My priority is to continue to build on this work as far as resources allow and to continue to expand the range of provision to include family learning, workplace learning, provision for special needs and for those for whom English is not the mother tongue, as well as optimising the use of TV so that people can access help in the privacy of their own homes.</P>
      <P>In 2000, the first ever TV series &ldquo;Read Write Now&rdquo; attracted an average weekly audience on 155,000. In 2001, an average of 235,000 people per week availed of literacy assistance in their homes through watching the second literacy series. A third series is currently being broadcast. In all cases, the TV programme has been backed up by free learner support packs and a freephone helpline provided by the National Adult Literacy Agency. Videos of the first and second series have been sent to literacy schemes, training centres, public libraries and video outlets. This strategy will be built on into the future. In addition, an innovative workplace literacy programme, Return to Learning, following a pilot scheme last year, has been introduced nationwide.</P>
      <P>The adult literacy budget has been increased from just over &euro;1 million prior to 1997 to &euro;16.460 million in the current year. Participation in VEC literacy schemes has been increased from 5,000 in 1997 to over 24,000 during the same period.</P>

It reflects the concerns of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and I in this regard, including the priority of the Government. The adult literacy and community education subhead is increased from &euro;24.542 million in 2002 to &euro;27.28 million in 2003. This should enable us to increase the adult literacy investment from approximately &euro;1.5 million to &euro;17.9 million, with the balance being used for the carry-over costs of the new work of community education facilitators. That is an increase of &euro;1.5 million which we are looking forward to using in the best possible way.

      <P>In response to Deputy Stanton regarding value for money, any money invested in this programme has been used very well by organisations such as NALA and Aontas. Since I was given this brief, I have had an opportunity to attend different conferences run by both organisations. I believe the money is very well spent and the take-up in this regard has greatly improved. As I said in my initial reply, we are talking about people who have taken an interest in the programme. Participation in VEC literacy schemes, for example, has increased from 5,000 in 1997 to 24,000 during the same period. It is obvious that this is value for money. I attended the meeting that took place at the Adult Learning Council. It will be very helpful because it brings together in one forum all the facets of adult learning.

This plan resulted directly from consultation with all the key elements in the area of youth work. The previous Minister did not do this off the top of his head. The national youth work development plan, to which I referred, is based on the work done by the NYWAC and under the Act. It follows through on those provisions.</P>

      <P>What is the Minister of State's vision for youth work? What does she want to see happening? Does she want to see youth services in every town and village? Does she agree that there is a great need for out-of-school activities for young people to divert them from alcohol abuse, drug abuse and other activities? In many of our towns there is absolutely nothing for our young people to do at night. This is an urgent problem. Instead of building prisons, we should be doing much more for youth services. This should be prioritised and fast-tracked. Can the Minister of State tell me her vision for this area?</P>

      <P>All of us recognise the tremendous voluntary effort contributed in all sorts of sectors, particularly the youth sector. All the youth organisations were given an opportunity under the last Administration to bring forward their proposals. I accept the views expressed by those who work within the sector on a day-to-day basis. We have gone through these priorities and come up with a national development plan which we will be implementing when we hear from the Department of Finance. I want it to be published, but to do this we must get the views of the other Ministers around the Cabinet table. To this end I intend to bring a memorandum to Government which summarises my own vision based on the consultation and work that has been done. The Deputy will be made aware of this once the decision of the Government on the memorandum has been taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen) Martin Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of its national groundwater monitoring programme, the Environmental Protection Agency identified the presence of uranium-238 in groundwater samples taken near Baltinglass, County Wicklow. In consequence, Wicklow County Council, following consultation with the South-Western Area Health Board, yesterday discontinued service from a particular well at Lathaleere which served the Baltinglass area. The EPA and the RPII are now assisting the council in follow-up action to determine the extent and implications of the uranium presence and what remedial measures would be necessary or appropriate.</P>
      <P>The agency is providing laboratory facilities to permit more extensive testing of samples from the affected source. In the meantime, the supply in question will remain out of service and alternative arrangements are in place for the supply of drinking water to the affected consumers. On the recommendation of the EPA, the council is also making arrangements to undertake a more generalised survey of public and private water supplies in County Wicklow to monitor uranium levels. The RPII already offers a radon measurement service to householders and recommends that such measurements should be carried out, especially in high risk areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are no specific national or EU standards for uranium in drinking water, the current legislation prescribing standards for the quality of drinking water in Ireland, the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, as amended, includes a provision that &ldquo;a sanitary authority may consider parameters other than those included in Part I of the Schedule . . .&rdquo;. The new drinking water regulations, which come into operation on 1 January 2004, strengthen and <Col N="697" />expand this provision. Section 7(5) of these regulations provides that &ldquo;a sanitary authority shall ensure that additional monitoring is carried out on a case-by-case basis of substances and micro-organisms for which no parametric value has been specified in Part 1 of the Schedule, if there is reason to suspect that such substances and or micro-organisms may be present in amounts or number which constitute a potential danger to human health&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The regulations transpose the new EU Drinking Water Directive, 98/83/EC, which encompasses monitoring for radioactivity, but the methods of monitoring and the list of radioactive parameters have yet to be finalised. When finalised, the directive will be revised and Ireland's implementing legislation will be amended accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his statement. Does he accept that it is a cause of great anxiety for households in the area directly affected, which contains a hospital, that the water supply they have been depending upon contains high levels of uranium, a material which is both toxic and radioactive? One of the questions that has been asked, which I now ask the Minister, is the reason for the time lag between the EPA becoming aware that the water was contaminated and the local authority closing the supply yesterday. Is the Minister satisfied the county council has the facilities and wherewithal to carry out an inspection of both public and group water schemes in the county and to deal with any findings it might unearth? Will the Minister ensure resources are provided by his Department for the inspection and to enable it to deal with the serious failings in the water supply, not just in Baltinglass but also in Arklow and Blessington where boiling notices are already in place because of e.coli contamination? Can he ensure resources will be made available to research the possible damage to people's health that may have occurred in the past 15 years so we know the full extent of what has happened? Uranium can damage the kidneys and cause kidney failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that an issue of this nature will cause great anxiety to those who have been using this water source. The delay was caused because the research had to be carried out. Laboratory testing had to take place and the health board had to be consulted. The issue was moved on as quickly as one could have wished for in terms of confirming the results to the council. It is important to point out that this is naturally occurring and has been in the water in the area for aeons, it is not something that has happened in recent times. The EPA and the RPII will assist the local authority now in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EPA is providing the local authorities with laboratory facilities and assistance with the test<Col N="698" />ing to ensure the public can be reassured as quickly as possible. I am not sure what resources the local authority might need but I will asses the requirements when I have all the information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I acknowledge that it would be difficult for him to have all the answers today. Of immediate concern, however, is a request to the Minister to instruct the EPA to carry out tests as a matter of urgency on the supply in Baltinglass. It comes from three different sources. One area supplies 20% of the water that has been shut off but the remaining supplies come from two separate sources, one in Banogues and the other in Tinoran. The levels in one of those supplies are over the recommended WHO levels and it may still be in use.</P>
      <P>We know very little about this. Will the Minister follow up the inspections with the establishment of a group to examine water supplies throughout the State? I tried to find out about this but information is very limited in the EU, Australia and Canada and, as a consequence, it is not covered by our water regulations. The EPA started testing ground water in 1995 but did not have the ability to test for uranium until 1999. Will the Minister check if the EPA has the ability to check only for uranium?</P>
      <P>I doubt that Wicklow County Council has the wherewithal to comply with a request from the EPA to do a survey of public and private water supplies in the county. There are, however, thousands of supplies and it must be done. Will the Minister examine the role of the EPA, the local authority and the health board? There already have been delays in this case. Will the Minister outline the role of the EPA in water testing throughout the State and will this discovery result in a change of policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>To reassure all Deputies from the county affected, a full and comprehensive review of all water sources is being undertaken and all bodies are working together on this. I am not sure how expert the county council is in the area but the EPA is directly involved and working with the local authority to carry out the survey as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Ironically, this occurred when ground water, not drinking water, was being tested and someone suddenly discovered it. In previous tests the uranium did not register. I cannot answer the Deputy's question about the equipment but I will let him know when I find out. There are high levels of uranium granite in the soil in a number of counties and they have been identified as areas of concern and testing has been carried out in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that research on this is not readily available in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU. That is why we are working towards the directive to pin this down. Some figures were <Col N="699" />bandied about during the day but the EPA has stated that to be of radiological significance, levels of naturally occurring uranium need to be in excess of 100 milligrams. I accept that levels are slightly above that but there is not a massive margin of difference. The WHO considers its figure of two milligrams as being unrealistic and will revise it substantially upwards.</P>
    <P>Research is under way and the RPII and the EPA are liaising. All the information is being filtered to complete the European directive and I will make that available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware of the fine work the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has done on naturally occurring radon gas. There are detailed maps of the concentration of the gas around the country. It typically occurs in granite and thus Wicklow is a prime candidate for it.</P>
      <P>Where there appears to be an absence of knowledge is in the differential health risks between naturally occurring radon within homes and dwellings and naturally occurring uranium within water supplies. Facts are needed to establish the relative health risks of uranium-238 in water and naturally occurring radon in the air. I assume there is a fair amount of information on this, perhaps not in Ireland, but certainly abroad. There are many examples abroad of high levels of naturally occurring radioactive substances within the soil or in the air as a result of geological activity.</P>
      <P>In terms of radon there is a simple testing mechanism that can be left in a house for one month and then returned to the RPII which may come back later with a readout. Will the Minister of State determine whether such a measuring mechanism is available that could be used for testing water and, if so, whether it could be made available to those in charge of municipal water supplies, group water supplies and to individual householders with their own wells? It is important to concentrate on the hot spots around the country and to proceed not only with testing but action to change the source of water supply where necessary. Will the Minister of State ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency or the RPII take urgent steps to determine the significance of this find in one well in Wicklow, whether it is repeated around the country and, if so, if it is a matter of concern to the general public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>All the information being assessed in Wicklow will be channelled and, hopefully, the information the Deputy seeks will emerge. Obviously that will teach us some lessons in regard to the specifics of Wicklow and it may be possible to transpose it into other areas based on the geological formations that exist. Perhaps some generalities can be drawn from those conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" />In the case of the RPII I have read some of its documents on radon research in which it had been involved. The Deputy is familiar with that. What we are dealing with today specifically is uranium-238 which I emphasise is naturally occurring and has existed for possibly hundreds of years. I am not saying that is an answer to the questions raised by the public but it is important to reassure people at this stage that we will get to the bottom of the position in Wicklow. Hopefully, there has been no damage to health. At EU level we can maximise and pool our input and find out the totality of information that is available. The best way of doing that is through the formulation of a directive, as is being done, and pooling that information which will feed back into the system in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point. I will speak about the other figure because it is significantly above even the EPA figure. My other question relates to small schemes, group schemes and individual schemes. In this instance we are talking about one well providing a public supply but there are obviously many small individual schemes around that area and in other parts. I also have concerns about County Carlow. In relation to the EU water framework directive, which is significant in terms of ensuring Ireland lives up to its commitments on surface and <Col N="701" />groundwater quality, will the Minister comment on the progress being made? Is it the case that contracts should have been completed in terms of getting work started on assessing the quality of groundwater and surface water, to lead to management plans being prepared for local authorities to take over in 2006? Will he give an undertaking that that work will be done given that his Estimate has been slashed? I understand there is a reduction of 2% in the Estimate for the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Commitments made at European Union level are now endangered. I ask for an assurance that the commitments made by Ireland in relation to the quality of ground and surface water, which was the origin of this discovery, will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a couple of important points which I am happy to answer directly. The quality of drinking water here is very good. We know this from travelling abroad to major European countries where we cannot drink the water but have to buy bottled water. The Deputy is correct, I would not be satisfied, nor would the Government, that we have got to the end of a process. There are a large number of group water schemes. As I stated was my objective during my tenure of office, I and my officials have been trying recently to rid us of this issue once and for all. Notwithstanding the difficulties in the public finances I intend to provide the necessary resources. The reason for some of the delay is that instead of assessing one scheme in an inefficient and less than cost effective way we have consulted with various group water schemes with a view to bringing them together. I opened a scheme recently which commenced during my tenure of office, in County Mayo near Kiltimagh. It is a tremendous scheme which is very cost efficient. I was amazed at the level of plant put in place and what it was producing. This is a good example of a number of schemes coming together with one proper plan to deal with all the issues arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House can be assured that one of my objectives is to resolve the water quality issue. The big difficulty lies with the group water schemes which the Deputy has identified. Where there are different schemes &ndash; I am not suggesting there are some in Wicklow &ndash; I want to bang heads together so things are not done on a scheme by scheme basis but together so as to maximise the resources available. Where we have stated that people have come forward quickly and agreed that the way forward is to bring different groups together. That is the key message in getting the schemes completed and my officials are working with local authorities and the local group schemes to put these together with a view to completion. The Deputy can be reassured regarding resources that as far as I am concerned the com<Col N="702" />mitments I have given and the large schemes we have been able to instigate and implement are proceeding. I intend to finish the group water schemes as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister try to get a test on the present supply as there are concerns about it? While he mentioned a figure of 100 for the EPA as opposed to the WHO figure of 2, will he agree that the figure used in the US is 30? It is important to realise that issues such as this are emotive. Factual information often goes out the window and it is difficult to approach things in a logical fashion and understandably so. Will the Minister request the EPA or his Department to issue a statement to the effect that U238 is a stable form of uranium that should not be confused with U235 and U234? People are naturally frightened when they hear mention of the word &ldquo;uranium&rdquo;. Does the Minister agree that it is difficult to comprehend how society gets excited about issues such as this and incineration matters given that radon is being released into many homes in this country? There is a scheme in operation for the testing of houses for radon but many households do not participate in it. Perhaps the Minister could take another look &ndash; previous Ministers have done so &ndash; at readvertising the availability of testing for radon in one's house.</P>
      <P>Current water supplies in Wicklow must be tested. We should also release a simple document dealing with this issue as soon as possible. The press statement released by the health board left a lot to be desired and by the time the instruction from the EPA to Wicklow County Council filtered down to the man or woman in the house it held no meaning for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I reassure the Deputy that all water supplies in the Wicklow area will be tested by the local authority in conjunction with the EPA as quickly as possible. Regarding the issuing of a statement of facts, I am always in favour of reassuring the public and imbuing in people confidence in the system. I will await the information flows which come back to me in this regard and if I feel there is enough information available to make a worthwhile statement, I will do so. As soon as I have some hard facts, I will communicate them to local Deputies to assist them in getting information out. It is important that we deal with the facts. I appreciate the tone and approach of Deputies which is helpful. It is a positive contribution towards getting facts into the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP" hpid="Mr. Cuffe Mr. Cuffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's commitment. We are all aware that certain forms of naturally occurring radiation can pose a significant threat to human health. Radon gas can cause lung cancer. Current building regulations regarding the construction of new dwellings ensure a radon barrier is used in high risk areas. I am sure the <Col N="703" />Minister is aware &ndash; if not, he should be &ndash; that many areas in the west such as Sligo, Ballina, Tuam and down through Ennis and Tralee are situated in high radon areas. We need to know whether there is a link between radon and U238 and whether U238 in water poses a degree of risk to the human population. I suspect it does if it exceeds the World Health Organisation's guidelines. We should issue a background paper on this through the Minister's office in conjunction with other agencies mentioned. I appeal to the Minister to get more facts into the public domain so the general public can be reassured that the levels of naturally occurring radiation in water supplies are not a threat to human health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. If there is correlation between the two issues as outlined by Deputy Cuffe that will be made public knowledge. I have no doubt the EPA is looking at the different aspects be it radon, naturally occurring uranium, etc. If a relationship is established and if it is adding to the difficulties, that will emerge. I will issue the facts as quickly as possible. I recognise the independence of the EPA and its role in this regard. I am sure it will understand it is imperative that we get clarity in the public domain as quickly as possible. I will endeavour to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Coveney. The Minister of State will be aware that Ballincollig community school is one of five schools currently being provided with new school facilities under the public private partnership contract. A particular set of circumstances have arisen in the application of the contract in Ballincollig community school in that the existing hall-gymnasium which is a perfectly functional and useable building, is set for demolition with no new building being erected in its place. The contract providers want to provide a new gymnasium and subsequently re-adjust the rates charged for outside community groups who use the facility. As the Minister of State can imagine this is causing a great deal of community dissent.</P>
      <P>If the Minister of State and the Government are interested in making public private partnerships work &ndash; he will be aware of my party's dubiousness regarding the particular application &ndash; they should meet the public in Ballincollig. Ballincollig, with a population of over 15,000, is more than justified in having two gymnasiums.</P>
      <P>I hope the flexibility which exists in schools building projects conventionally put together is something that might be applied to this new once-off arrangement. In responding to my reservations and those of my colleagues in the constituency, I hope the Minister of State and the Government will take account of the concerns which exist in Ballincollig and the need for a resolution which takes account of the demands of the area and the much-needed community facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Boyle for sharing his time. This is a serious issue. Deputy Boyle and I have been to community meetings in Ballincollig and listened to the concerns outlined by him to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I differ from Deputy Boyle in some ways in that I think the public private partnership route <Col N="705" />can have positive results for education and fast-tracking building projects. However, I think a mistake has been made in this case. An opportunity is being missed. It seems unbelievable that we are demolishing, in a town of close to 20,000 people, a perfectly satisfactory gymnasium. The people who use it claim it is one of the best gymnasiums in County Cork. The basketball club, which has a huge membership, is anxious to make this its home club venue. The building is being demolished as part of the public private partnership contract with a view to building a new school with a new gymnasium. We are trying to make the case at this late stage in the process that the Minister consider talking to Jarvis which was awarded the contract in 2000 to see whether it is possible to build a new school and a new gymnasium while, at the same time, keeping the old gymnasium for use by the community. I have talked to them to see if it is possible at this late stage to build a new school, with the new gym, while keeping the old gym facility for the use of the community. That should be possible as the old gym is in an isolated section of the site. With imagination and practical application, a result that keeps the community and the school happy is possible.</P>
    <P>The history of Ballincollig Community School has been a successful one in the context of the sharing of facilities between the school and the community. It is a shame, when we should be celebrating a fantastic project for Ballincollig, that this conflict has divided the community and that a gym which has been used successfully for a number of years will be demolished. I hope the Minister has some positive news and has not shut the door entirely.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Boyle and Coveney for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science position on this matter. As the Deputies are aware, the new Ballincollig Community School, procured under the public private partnership model, includes the most up-to-date sports facilities. These consist of a first class gymnasium, fitness area and outdoor basketball and tennis courts. Following an EU-wide tender competition, the contract for the construction of a bundle of five post-primary schools, including Ballincollig, under the first education public private partnership project was signed in November 2001 with Jarvis Projects Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the PPP procurement model, outputs are developed for the project and interested consortia submit bids including a design that will meet the Department's requirements. Following the submission of bids for this project, evaluation groups were established to assess the bids under design and technical, services, finance and legal <Col N="706" />issues. This process involved a detailed examination and evaluation of each bidder's proposal.</P>
    <P>It is important in the case of the Ballincollig school that none of the three bidders considered the retention and refurbishment of the existing sports hall as part of their design solution for a number of significant reasons, including the existing roof covering being made of asbestos, the shrinkage of upright pillars, dampness in sections of the building and the cost of renovation of the existing dressing rooms and shower area.</P>
    <P>The Jarvis bid included the removal of the existing gymnasium and the provision of six new outdoor basketball and tennis courts on that site. Therefore, following a thorough evaluation of the Jarvis bid, it was selected as the preferred bidder for the grouped school project and a binding legal contract was signed with the Department of Education and Science. The Deputies should also note that this project went through the planning process and full planning permission was granted that included the removal of the existing hall. I understand that there were no planning objections at the time.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the new facilities being provided will be of the highest standard and the school board of management, in tandem with Jarvis, has indicated that it will work closely with the local community to ensure the widest possible use of the new facilities.</P>

      <P>I am pleased the Ceann Comhairle has given me the opportunity to raise this important issue. I recently asked the Minister for Health and Children the cross-departmental action that should task place in light of recent surveys, especially by the association for health promotion which outlines in its paper the significant ramifications of our drink culture. The association for health board promotion in its executive summary states that alcohol has traditionally been the drug of choice in Ireland. The Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, Deputy Noel Ahern, should take over responsibility for alcohol abuse, which is currently the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children. If alcohol is a drug, it is important it is under the remit of the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, considering his role in the task forces on drugs. This change of roles should enable the Minister of State to co-ordinate the action in different spheres which is not co-ordinated and, therefore, is ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the strategic task force on alcohol but the implementation of its recommendations will require a co-ordinated multi-sectoral response &ndash; I refer to the parliamentary questions I put down today. This matter should be progressed as soon as possible. There is not only an <Col N="707" />under age drinking problem in Ireland but a drink culture. It is easy to pass this off as an under age problem but it is more than that. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said today that legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the age card scheme, can help to curtail the problems. However, the Minister said that they cannot be viewed as the only solution and that everybody must work together. This will not happen without action at cross-departmental level. That action is needed now and if we do not realise that, we are far removed from our work as public representatives and the people we represent.</P>
    <P>The statistics on this issue have shocked me. <i>Per capita </i>consumption of alcohol has increased by 41% in the decade 1989-99; Irish teens rank among the highest in Europe for all measures of alcohol consumption; alcohol is a primary cause of 33% of fatal road accidents and a factor in 40% of road collisions &ndash; the Minister for Transport must look at that closely; alcohol is a contributory factor in unwanted pregnancies and in teenage sexual activity; and 48% of all criminal offences are alcohol related, as are 88% of public order offences, 48% of offences against the person and 54% of criminal damage offences. That is significant and if the problem was addressed, it would halve the current crime level.</P>
    <P>There has been a 370% increase in the detection of intoxication in public places by under age drinkers since 1996; one in four of those presenting to accident and emergency units have an alcohol related injury or illness; access to alcohol is an increasingly important factor in teenage suicides; and alcohol is related to many cancers, a point which was supported by a study released yesterday which claimed that women are six times more likely to develop breast cancer if they drink one glass of wine per day. Heavy intake of alcohol is associated with chronic conditions such as stroke, hypertension, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis; one third of marital breakdown is attributed to alcohol; 26% of all male and 11% of all female first admissions to psychiatric services are due to alcohol related diagnosis; alcohol causes problems for the unborn child; and the most important statistic is the economic cost of alcohol-related problems &ndash; approximately &euro;2.37 billion in 1999. That figure covers health care costs, accidents, crime, absenteeism, transfer payments and lost taxes, and is equivalent to 60% of the total revenue to the Exchequer from alcohol.</P>
    <P>If those figures do not speak for themselves and if the Ministers involved do not see this as an important aspect of their policy making, I should sit down at this point. However, our Ministers are aware of this and there is a willingness to deal with the problem. People are working on this like hamsters on a wheel. Everybody is moving on <Col N="708" />their little wheel whereas if they all got on to one big wheel, there would be much greater progress.</P>
    <P>We understand the problem and how it needs to be addressed. Hard decisions need to be taken by the Minister for Health and Children regarding cigarette use and abuse, and I was heavily involved in that process as convenor of the health committee in the last Dáil. We have many potential advantages in dealing with this problem. For a bright future, I ask that activities be co-ordinated and brought under the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children has been actively involved in a wide range of initiatives aimed at tackling alcohol misuse. Many of these initiatives involve both cross-departmental and cross-sectoral action. These include a primary school substance misuse prevention programme called, Walk Tall. It was initially developed for the designated drug task force areas. However, it has been extended nationwide and is now part of the social, personal and health education curriculum in primary schools. The programmes are developed and delivered in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science, health boards and teachers.</P>
      <P>Adolescents are targeted through the substance abuse prevention programme called, On My Own Two Feet, a life skills approach within the broad concept of the health promoting school. This programme is also part of the social, personal and health education curriculum in post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>A framework for developing a college alcohol policy was developed by the health promotion unit following extensive consultations with the universities and institutes of technology as well as the Union of Students in Ireland. The framework is designed to assist colleges to develop policies to promote sensible drinking among students and limit alcohol related harm on campus. It was developed following concerns raised by colleges on a number of issues, including alcohol promotion practices on campus, high risk drinking among students, the impact of this drinking pattern on academic achievement, student personal problems and student attrition.</P>
      <P>Youth groups in the informal sector are supported by the National Youth Council of Ireland health promotion programme funded by the health promotion unit. Through this scheme youth leaders working in local communities are provided with training. It offers ongoing health education and health promotion training to the out-of-school sector. The programme specifically provides youth organisations with training on substance abuse policy development and alcohol education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" />The development of the responsible serving of alcohol programme was also a joint initiative between the health promotion unit, the drinks industry and CERT. The programme was developed specifically for those who work in the bar trade and hospitality sector. Its objective is to limit harm in the drinking environment by not serving intoxicated customers, encouraging the use of age cards as standard practice and promoting alternative strategies to reduce drink driving.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit is also represented on other alcohol related initiatives such as the commission on liquor licensing established by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda youth advisory group established by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>In January this year the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, also established a strategic task force on alcohol under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer of the Department. The task force is broadly based and representative of experts from Departments, health boards, NGOs, public health, health promotion, health and safety, education, the Garda Síochána, sports and recreation, parents, the drinks industry, alcohol treatment services and the health promotion unit.</P>
    <P>The task force produced an interim report in May this year. I understand the recommendations contained in the position paper referred to by the Deputy and which was drafted in September broadly reflect those of the task force. The implementation of the task force recommendations will require a co-ordinated multi-sectoral response and I am confident that the support needed from other statutory and non-statutory agencies will be forthcoming in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment. I raise it because Iarnród Éireann on Wednesday morning last broke two sections of the Transport Act, 1950. Sections 19 and 21 of the Act were ignored by the company when it removed and closed the Limerick to Sligo rail line at Athenry, County Galway. This was in blatant contradiction of a commitment it had given to the Minister, the Taoiseach gave to the House last week and the Minister gave on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; show on Monday morning that the line would not be closed. Despite this, on Wednesday morning it was closed in contravention of the two sections of the Transport Act, 1950, which state two months notice must be given of the closure of the line and that this must be published in both <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and local papers circulating in the area. That did not happen in this case. Iarnród Éireann is blatantly breaking the law by closing a section of the rail line between Athenry and Claremorris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" />I also understand the company is trying to downgrade the line at Claremorris and that it would require significant investment were it to reopen at some stage in the future. Iarnród Éireann estimates the cost of reinstating the line at Athenry would be in the region of &euro;750,000. However, if it were to upgrade the line at this point and provide for signalling, it would cost &euro;225,000. The reason it is not prepared to reinstate the line is that it wants to predetermine the strategic rail review and close the line.</P>
    <P>The company has physically removed the track to ensure it cannot be reopened to provide commuter and freight services. It is concerned that a private operator would provide freight services for companies such as Coillte which transports quantities of timber to Waterford equating to five trainloads or 125 trucks of timber per week. Iarnród Éireann wants to close the line to ensure this cannot happen.</P>
    <P>The company claims the reason it is closing the line is an issue of safety. It wants to remove the turnout at Athenry. However, it is leaving one in place at the other end of the station for the line to Limerick. It is also installing signalling for the line to Limerick but removing it at the Claremorris end. It also states the line has not been in use for some time. However, the last train ran on it two years ago.</P>
    <P>The company claims it is unviable to keep the line open. It is viable in so far as the timber Coillte transports by road to Waterford is concerned. The plantation where felling takes place adjoins the rail line. The timber could be loaded directly from the plantation onto trains with little cost involved. The company is concerned that a private operator would do this, which is the reason it has removed the line.</P>
    <P>There is huge potential to develop the western rail corridor to provide inter-city services between Sligo, Limerick, Cork and Waterford and a commuter service from Mayo via Tuam to Galway city which would greatly ease congestion on the N17. The Minister gave a commitment on Monday morning that this line would not be closed, but it has been removed as of Wednesday morning. One of the key reasons for establishing the strategic rail review was to examine the feasibility of reopening the Limerick-Athenry-Claremorris-Sligo line. When the previous Minister with responsibility for this area, Senator O'Rourke, launched the strategic rail review, she focused specifically on the western rail corridor. With two months to the publication of the report, Iarnród Éireann has removed the turnout at Athenry which has effectively closed the line which would mean a minimum cost of reopening it in the future of &euro;500,000 on top of the additional cost of the consequences of actions the company may take at Claremorris.</P>
    <P>It is evident the company does not want to retain the western rail corridor which blatantly <Col N="711" />contradicts stated Government policy on rail lines, freight and the spatial strategy which identified Letterkenny, Sligo and Limerick as gateway cities. This line would facilitate the development of those cities and also has the potential to develop Knock Airport with a 9 km rail link which would make it the only international airport in the country with a proper public transport service rail link.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by Iarnród Éireann that Athenry is being resignalled as part of a project to modernise the signalling system on the Dublin to Galway line. Design work has been completed for some time and installation work is under way at various stations on the line and is scheduled to be completed in mid-2003. On completion, passengers on the Galway to Dublin line can expect to see significant improvement in terms of comfort, safety and speed on the route.</P>
      <P>When lines are resignalled the opportunity is taken to simplify the track layout of the line based on present services and traffic. There are currently no services on the Athenry-Claremorris line. The cost of reinstating the Claremorris crossover would be of the order of approximately &euro;750,000 and has been excluded from the resignalling project. Should services be restored to the Athenry-Claremorris line the crossover can be quickly and easily reinstated at a similar level of cost. No track will be lifted on the Athenry-Claremorris line.</P>
      <P>The strategic rail review, which is nearing completion, is examining the future options for this line. This review will examine the long-term rail requirements for the country as a whole in the light of the emerging spatial planning and regional development policies and local land use and transportation studies. The primary purpose of the review is to provide the Government with the basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an extensive nationwide consultation exercise on the scope of the review, the Department of Transport received more than 150 written submissions with regard to rail issues in Ireland. These included proposals for the reopening of old rail lines, the construction of new lines, spurs and loops to the current network and the upgrading of current services. The submissions were the subject of further discussions at public consultation workshops held in Dublin, Limerick and Sligo. I understand the submissions included proposals for the development of a western rail corridor which would link Sligo with Cork via Claremorris, Athenry and Limerick. This proposal, along with all the other rail proposals received, is being assessed by the review consult<Col N="712" />ants who, in finalising the review, will make recommendations in regard to them.</P>
    <P>The strategic rail review will be published in late January 2003.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this issue.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Children's Rights Alliance on the excellent work it is doing. Unfortunately, I congratulate it on a day when we have to condemn the Government's decision to target children and the poorest and sickest in society by axing its promise to extend the medical card scheme to an extra 200,000 people. These cuts are being introduced at a time when casualty and prescription charges have been increased. The commitment given in the health strategy just a year ago is one of many reneged on by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that those on the lowest income, as low as &euro;130 a week, should be targeted to pay for the Government's mishandling of the nation's finances. Not alone is eligibility not being expanded but medical cards are being withdrawn from people at a time when the Government is increasing charges for health care and medicines. It is counter productive to deny access to primary care. Early intervention can save thousands of euro in hospital costs.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for the Department of Health and Children indicate that many of the services that relate to children, such as dental, ophthalmic and aural services and pre-school support schemes have benefited by only 5% while medical inflation is at 10%. The domiciliary care allowance and maternity grant have been increased by only 1%. In effect, these are cuts in services to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN convention on the rights of the child states that every child has the right to an adequate standard of living and that states party <Col N="713" />to the convention have an obligation to ensure children are able to fully develop their human potential. Ireland is a State party to the convention, having ratified the human rights treaty in 1992. At least 8% of Irish children live in constant poverty. That means they live in a household with an income below 60% of average disposable income and experience enforced basic deprivation. Approximately 24% of Irish children lived in relative income poverty in 2000 with a household income of below 50% of the average disposable income.</P>
    <P>A recent conference on child poverty featured the launch of a major study on ending child poverty in rich countries and found that employment based strategies alone cannot be relied on to eliminate poverty. The conference, which drew together Irish and international experts on poverty and social development, called for the expansion of a universal child benefit payment combined with targeted supplementary payments for disadvantaged families. More than any other group in society children are vulnerable to the negative impact of spending and tax policy decisions made during periods of financial crisis. This is particularly true for children who live in poverty, for those with special needs and for those who can secure their fundamental human rights only if and when the Government meets its obligations.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a succession of announcements and proposals which are inconsistent with the best interests of children and if implemented they will undermine and potentially reverse a number of national policies and commitments relating to children. Cuts in programmes for those with educational disadvantage, cancellation of the extension of the medical card to hundreds of thousands of families who live in poverty, shelving much of the health strategy and the suggestion that child benefit be taxed are but a few of the announced or reported cuts that involve the rights and welfare of children. In this environment virtually every element of the national children's strategy and the national anti-poverty strategy requiring public expenditure is at risk and in need of defensive campaigns to preserve some degree of what was promised or what exists already.</P>
    <P>A group of three wise men, whose views on children's rights and needs are unknown, have been asked to undertake a review of all Government spending, including that on programmes which affect children. Another group has been established to examine tax policy. At 3.20 p.m. today the Children's Rights Alliance condemned the Government's decision to break its promise to provide medical cards and Mr. Dooley stated, &ldquo;We try to teach our children the importance of keeping our promises. What are they to think when they hear that the Government is breaking <Col N="714" />its promise to them, the children? What kind of example is that to set for children?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are disappointed the increase in the Health Estimates for mental health services is just 5% at a time when medical inflation is at 10%. That is, effectively, a cut of 5%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The pre-budget submission by the Children's Rights Alliance advocates the implementation of a range of measures towards the objective of ending child poverty. Our programme for Government recognises that the tackling of child poverty is a core element of our work and several initiatives are in place to enable us to progressively achieve the goal of ending child poverty in our society.</P>
      <P>Children have been specifically identified as a group vulnerable to poverty in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, Building an Inclusive Society, published by the Government in February 2002. A key overall objective of the strategy is to eliminate child poverty and move to a situation of greater equality for all children in terms of access to appropriate education, health and housing, thus breaking the cycle of disadvantage and exclusion experienced by certain children in society.</P>
      <P>The NAPS contains a specific commitment to set the equivalence rate for basic child income support at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate. This commitment is allied to one which aims to achieve, by 2007, a rate of &euro;150 per week, in 2002 terms, for the lowest rates of social welfare. The revised NAPS also includes a number of specific targets relating to children, notably in the areas of education and health.</P>
      <P>The most recent results available, from the Living in Ireland Survey of 2000, show that we have made significant progress in relation to reducing child poverty in recent years. From a level of 24.8% in 1987, consistent poverty among children fell to a level of 8% in 2000. A number of factors have positively influenced this trend, the most important of which is the unprecedented growth in employment and fall in unemployment that we have experienced in recent years. Significantly fewer children are now living in workless households. Unemployment now stands at just over 4% compared to the level of 11.9% in April 1996, the latest figure at the time the NAPS was launched, a very substantial achievement.</P>
      <P>A second key factor is the effective use of the child benefit scheme in combating child poverty. This is mainly due to the fact that it is neither taxed nor withdrawn if employment is taken up and thus does not contribute to poverty or unemployment traps or create employment disincentives. Payments under the scheme now amount to &euro;117.60 for the first and second children and &euro;147.30 for the third and subsequent children. This represents a trebling of payments since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" />The heavy investment of the last two years has yet to be reflected in the child poverty rates as the latest poverty figures, as I have stated, relate to the year 2000. While the extent of child poverty, and the progress we make towards eliminating it, are largely measured through factors related to income levels, interventions not directly related to income, such as family policy, have a direct effect on children's lives and can help prevent poverty and social exclusion, both now and in the future.</P>
    <P>The ambition of eliminating child poverty is extended to the national children's strategy, published in November 2000, a ten year Government plan to improve children's lives. The plan covers a wide range of areas relating to children, including the issue of child poverty. The strategy embraces a whole child perspective, which reflects a more complete understanding of how children live their lives and the central role families and local communities play. New structures have been established to support the implementation of the strategy, including a Cabinet committee on children, a broader role for the Mini<Col N="716" />ster with responsibility for children, the establishment of a national children's office and a role for the city and county development boards in the local implementation of the strategy, the objective of which in relation to child poverty is to provide children with the financial supports necessary to eliminate child poverty.</P>
    <P>In addition to setting targets under the NAPS and increases in child benefit, the actions proposed under the child poverty objective of the strategy include initiatives to support money management in families and further securing supports for lone parent families. We have made significant progress in recent years in reducing child poverty. However, the dynamic nature of poverty and social exclusion ensues we need to adjust our policy responses to meet new needs all the time. I am confident that the policy frameworks in place allow for a multi-dimensional response to the problem of child poverty, the eventual elimination of which will remain a priority for the Government.</P>

      <P>Parents' views on the development of the whole school evaluation, WSE, model have been represented by the National Parents &ndash; Council-primary-and National Parents Council-post-primary &ndash; at all stages of the extensive consultative process which began in 1996 and which involved 19 partner groups in education. During the WSE pilot project 1998-99, parent representatives, as members of school boards of management, were given the opportunity at both pre-evaluation and post-evaluation meetings to express their views on the process as it related to their particular school. Any such views were taken into account during the finalisation of the relevant WSE school report, a copy of which was issued to the school's board of management in each case.</P>
      <P>The WSE pilot project report 1999 acknowledged and emphasised the need to explore the best means of incorporating the perspectives of parents in the WSE process. The development and expansion of such opportunities will constitute part of the preparation for the introduction of WSE to all schools in due course.</P>
      <P>During 2003 it is planned to begin the process of extending WSE to all schools on a phased basis. The process will allow for ongoing review of the operation of the WSE model as it is experienced from various participant perspectives, and will permit adjustments to aspects of the model that may require modification. The model will provide for a more structured role for parents in the school evaluation process than obtains at present and will therefore recognise the role of parents as important stakeholders in the education of their children. The new model will incorporate meetings between the inspectors and representatives of parents' associations or parents' councils where such exist in the school.</P>
      <P>The aim of school evaluation is entirely about improving the quality of education for our young people in their schools. WSE is designed to contribute to that aim, taking the views of all concerned, including parents, into account. The arrangements for the implementation of WSE will be notified to schools and the educational community through the publication of a circular which will be prepared in my Department.</P>

      <P>There are 910 untrained teachers paid in primary schools at present in a temporary capacity. In the current school year untrained teachers serving in a temporary capacity have been paid for 14,561 days which includes weekends.</P>
      <P>In the current school year 22,753 days have been worked by unqualified substitutes in primary schools. The information relating to the number of pupils in classes being taught by the teachers concerned is not available as the arrangement of classes is a matter for the relevant school authorities.</P>
      <P>As part of a range of initiatives to improve teacher supply, the intake to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999 more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the undergraduate B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</P>
      <P>The total annual intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,460 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the colleges of education regarding a further post graduate course due to commence in early 2003 are currently taking place. My Department will also be consulting with the colleges in the near future with regard to the provision of modular type courses for secondary trained teachers with the necessary academic requirement in Irish.</P>
      <P>Between 2002 and 2003 it is projected that some 2,700 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling &euro;120 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for implementation of many of these recommendations lies with my Department. Some recommendations require action on the part of other Departments. On a wider level, the recommendations call for action on the part of third level institutions, schools and community and voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>To date a number of measures have been taken by my Department in response to some of the main recommendations in the report. The most significant spending recommendation of that group concerned the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. These recommendations were introduced, with retrospective effect, from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>Following a recent review, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%, a significant increase. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and &euro;1,600 for students resident within 15 miles of college. This is equivalent to a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; of &euro;1,490 and &euro;596, respectively, for eligible students on the ordinary maintenance grant. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management &ndash; ADM &ndash; Limited, under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was &euro;1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund. For 2002-03, I have <Col N="720" />increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million. ADM Limited, which is continuing to administer the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.</P>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a co-ordinated framework of actions required to improve equity of access to third level. The group considered that a single co-ordinating body was essential in order to realise the framework. Accordingly, a key recommendation of the group was that a national office for equity of access to higher education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>I have, within the past week, informed the House that I have given approval for the establishment of the national office for equity of access to higher education, within the Higher Education Authority. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>
    <P>Some of the action group's recommendations relate to the achievement of specific targets for access to third level education, over the period of the national development plan, by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability.</P>
    <P>I am committed to progressing these, and other, recommendations in the report of the action group on access to third level education and to ensuring that the issue of equity of access to third level education remains a priority during my tenure of office as Minister for Education and Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Schools are allowed six days during the current school year in order to facilitate inservice training for teachers in respect of the revised primary curriculum. Under the school development planning initiative all schools are allowed a further day. This represents a total of approximately 170,000 teaching days. Due to the scale of the inservice programme and the fact that it is necessary to ensure that all the teachers concerned attend core training in these important programmes, there is no feasible alternative at present to holding such core training during school time. The training, however, is organised so as to cause as little disruption as possible to <Col N="721" />the school and as much advance notice as possible is provided to allow schools and families make appropriate arrangements.</P>
      <P>In addition to the training for these initiatives, a significant number of inservice courses for primary teachers take place outside school hours. In many cases, courses at local level take place at night and may be organised for individual teachers, schools or clusters of local schools.</P>
      <P>However, I am keenly aware of concerns over any disruption in the school year. I assure parents and school management that, in consultation with the interested parties, my Department is actively trying to find ways to minimise disruptions. This is being done in the context of a broad examination of new in-service models both at primary and post-primary level.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the issue to which the Deputy refers and I am most anxious that this matter be resolved as speedily as possible. I have met the parents involved and am aware of their concerns in relation to the matter.</P>
      <P>The issues involved have been the subject of high level discussions between my Department and the Department of Health and Children. Arising from these discussions, a senior member of my Department's inspectorate and a representative of the Department of Health and Children were appointed to visit the centre to review the situation and assist local management in resolving the current difficulty. The officials in question have already had discussions with the parents, staff and management at the centre. In addition, an experienced independent facilitator has been working with the parties in an effort to resolve matters. The report of the facilitator is due very shortly and I am hopeful that his report will provide a basis for a resolution of the current difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adequate resources have been made available to ensure the delivery to the required level of both education and health care services at the centre. Responsibility for ensuring that the various inputs are delivered in a co-ordinated manner rests with the local management authorities. The guiding principle informing such arrangements must be that the needs of the children are paramount and that they require and are entitled to a multi-disciplinary response involving education and health care services. In this regard, the education and health care professionals assigned to work with the children need to make appropri<Col N="722" />ate arrangements to meet the specific needs of each of the children.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the report of the facilitator will provide a basis for resolving the current difficulties at St. Vincent's to the satisfaction of all concerned, particularly the parents of the children involved. I assure the Deputy of my commitment to supporting any measures which contribute to this objective and I would call on all the parties involved to work towards this goal.</P>

      <P>My Department has currently over 400 major primary school capital projects at various stages of architectural planning. All these projects would have undergone a detailed assessment by my Department and the majority require a combination of upgrading or the provision of additional teaching and other ancillary accommodation such as general purpose rooms.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to address the historical deficit in educational infrastructure. However, it is clearly not possible to wipe out the cumulative deficit of many years and to deal with emerging needs at the same time. The programme of activity for 2003 will be determined once the budgetary process has concluded, taking into account contractual commitments on projects already approved. It is my intention to publish the proposed programme early in 2003 so that all school authorities and other interested parties can be clear on the status and likely progress on any project.</P>
      <P>I do not expect, however, that it will be possible, as suggested by the Deputy, to complete all of the projects currently on hands within a period of 12 months. Nonetheless, the Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in the agreed programme for Government. To meet our objectives I will be looking closely at the potential for using PPP mechanisms and the concept advanced in An Agreed Programme for Government of a multi-annual programme schools modernisation fund to be financed through the National Development Finance Agency.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the school transport scheme is to ensure that pupils, who might otherwise have difficulty in attending school, can do so on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The scheme conveys over 130,000 pupils, at both primary and post-primary levels, to school at present. In providing this service, in the region of 2,850 vehicles are required daily covering approximately 5,600 routes to school.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of the school transport users are satisfied with the service provided.

      <P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarships scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the student support schemes and the application, means testing and disbursement processes involved, officials of my Department have engaged with officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to options for the future administration of the various student support schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration has been given to a proposal that a transfer of responsibility for the operation <Col N="724" />of the maintenance grants schemes to a single agency or body, such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs, might be administratively more appropriate.</P>
    <P>This view has been endorsed by the Cromien report of October 2000 on the review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs and by the report of the action group on access to third level education which was published in July 2001.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the timeframe for delivering on the commitments in an Agreed Programme for Government of June 2002 is the term of office of the Government. When I have had an opportunity of considering the range of issues involved in implementing the commitment, I would expect to be in a position to arrive at a more definitive timeframe.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also appreciate that there are major implications, for example, for the local authorities and vocational education committees, in any proposals to change the administration of the maintenance grants schemes.

      <P>The scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, is an interim measure aimed at providing a limited assessment service to schools that do not yet have access to the psychological service provided by the national educational psychological service, NEPS. As this is the second year of the operation of the scheme, the guidelines for the scheme have been slightly amended in the light of the experience of the first year.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of September 2002, 37 additional psychologists have been appointed to NEPS. Thirty of these have now completed their induction programme and NEPS management is currently assigning them to schools. Once this process has been completed, the SCPA guidelines will be circulated to all primary and post-primary schools eligible to avail of the scheme, that is, those that do not have access to the NEPS service at present. The revised guidelines will also be posted on my Department's website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A limit on the number of assessments allowed to each school has been set in order to ensure that all eligible schools have some access to the scheme. Small schools, with less than 100 pupils, will now be allowed to commission an assessment <Col N="725" />for each 50 pupils. This arrangement will apply retrospectively and schools may also carry over any unused allocation from the school year 2001-02. NEPS management recognises that, in some cases, the limit set may not meet the needs of the school. They will therefore keep the operation of the scheme under continuous review during the current school year. As the NEPS service is expanded, fewer schools will need to avail of the scheme and it may be possible to amend the limit on the number of assessments allowed to each school.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the development of the common commercial policy of the Union is a Community competence. In relation to the general agreement on trade in services the relevant EU forum for negotiations is the article 133 services committee. The EU uses this forum to consult with member states via their trade ministries.</P>
      <P>In recent times, education Ministers have been increasingly involved in the debate on trade in education services. Indeed, the matter has recently been considered informally by the Education Council. The Irish position is that it is vital that education Ministers have a role in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, provides a means of compensating people who, as vulnerable children, were committed into institutional care and who suffered abuse there and consequent lifelong injury notwithstanding the duty of the State to regulate the institutions. The Taoiseach apologised on 11 May to the victims of such abuse.</P>
      <P>The decision to set up a scheme of redress was taken without regard to whether the religious congregations, who owned and managed the institutions concerned, would make any contribution to the cost of the scheme. However, shortly after the Government's decision, the religious congregations concerned approached the Government indicating that they wished to make a meaningful contribution to the compensation scheme.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomed this approach because, apart from the financial contribution, the Government felt that some closure to the issue of childhood abuse could best be achieved if both the religious congregations and the State participated.</P>
      <P>Following negotiations between representatives of the religious congregations and the State, my predecessor reached agreement in principle in January 2002 on the size and nature of their contribution. Further negotiations followed which culminated in a detailed agreement to which the Deputy refers. The total value of the contribution is &euro;128 million payable in cash, property and services to victims.</P>
      <P>In return for this contribution the previous Government agreed to grant an indemnity to the congregations. This indemnity applies only to those cases which are eligible to be dealt with under the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, but which are not resolved within this scheme and in respect of which litigation is commenced within six years of the date of the agreement.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that all, or certainly the majority of cases, will be dealt with through the redress scheme rather than in the courts. Therefore, it is expected that the indemnity will apply to relatively few cases. However, as there is no way to predict at this time how many claimants will prefer to go through the courts rather than the redress scheme, I am not in a position to estimate the likely cost to the taxpayer of the indemnity.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are probably aware, before the redress scheme was introduced there were over 1,000 cases in which legal proceedings had been commenced in the High Court against the State and various congregations. These cases will now have the alternative of being processed through the redress scheme where awards are as recommended by the report of the independent advisory committee. It is also likely that other claimants will come forward.</P>

      <P>The charge referred to by the Deputies is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services. The increase in the charge brings the amount contributed by students more into line with the cost of providing these services.</P>
      <P>Students who are eligible for means tested student support will, in addition to any grant they are entitled to, have the &euro;670 charge paid on their behalf by my Department or by the local authorities and vocational education committees. This means that 34% of students in universities and 47% of students in institutes of technology will not have to pay the charge.</P>
      <P>The increase in the charge should be viewed in the context of an overall package of measures that I announced earlier this year aimed at increasing and improving the student support schemes for the 2002-03 academic year. In the present financial year the Government will spend over &euro;360 million on student supports.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost per student of providing third level education in the present academic year will exceed &euro;6,000 for arts, law and business courses, &euro;8,000 for science courses and &euro;9,000 for engineering and medicine. The contribution from the students has to be seen in the light of these figures.</P>

      <P>The total annual amount paid in respect of fee-charging secondary schools is &euro;77.5 million. Of this sum approximately &euro;68.5 million relates to salaries and allowances of teachers. The balance includes the Protestant block grant, funding towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking services and grants in 2002 towards supervision arrangements.</P>
      <P>The payment of teachers' salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee-charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions. Teachers in fee-charging schools, irrespective of the denominational ethos of the school, are paid by the State. This may well reflect a long standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.</P>
      <P>There are 58 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant. The latter schools receive funding by way of the Protestant block grant, which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant persuasion to attend schools, which reflect their denominational ethos. The block grant includes payments in respect of captivation and these schools also qualify for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant and secretarial and caretaking grants. Fee-charging schools not embraced by the Protestant block grant do not qualify for payment of captivation or related supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans, at this stage, to withdraw State support for the payment of teachers in fee-charging schools. This support has been a long-<Col N="729" />standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.</P>

      <P>The school completion programme, SCP, which is a new and expanded programme to deal with early school leaving, was introduced earlier this year. The school completion programme incorporates the elements of best practice established by the eight to 15 year old early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay in school retention initiative at second level, SSRI, the pilot phases of which came to an end in August and July 2002, respectively.</P>
      <P>The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>A total of 82 project sites in 22 counties involving approximately 105 post-primary schools and 273 primary schools have been selected to participate in the project strand of the school completion programme over the next three years. Selection of project sites for the expansion of the programme is based on detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database. This analysis also identified their main feeder primary schools. A total of 53 SSRI schools, which were not selected for inclusion in the project strand, will continue to be funded under the stay in school retention strand of the programme over the next three years up to 31 August 2005.</P>
      <P>Currently, the projects are in the process of submitting three year retention plans to my Department for approval and allocation of funding. In 2001 expenditure on the SSRI and the ESLI schemes was &euro;11.5 million. Significant additional funding was made available under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 with assistance from the ESF fund for an expansion of these initiatives. In 2002 it is expected that spending outturn will be approximately &euro;16.5 million.</P>
      <P>Figures in relation to the number of young people targeted by this programme are not readily available at present. The figures will be compiled on receipt of all retention plans and I will arrange to have them forwarded to the Deputy in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 40 together, as both relate to the recent publication of Education at a Glance &ndash; OECD Indicators 2002.</P>
      <P>Ireland comes out well in many of the OECD's comparisons, which is a reflection of the quality of our schools and teachers and, especially, of the ability of our young people to meet the many and varied challenges they are likely to face in their lives.</P>
      <P>Irish students performed extremely well in the reading literacy measures included in the report, coming fifth out of 27 countries reported on. While our mathematical literacy was about average, Irish students also scored well on a measure of scientific knowledge, coming ninth out of the 27 countries in the study.</P>
      <P>The report draws particular attention to the success some countries, including Ireland, have had in combining high quality education with social equity. This finding shows that our schools are having a great deal of success in ensuring that all students, whatever their backgrounds, can develop to their potential and is a great tribute to the work of both teachers and the school authorities. However, Ireland's relatively good performance in terms of equity in education by international standards does not provide grounds for complacency in this area. Substantial inequalities in education persist in the Irish education system and I am determined to address these issues at all levels of the system.</P>
      <P>One area of continuing concern to me and to the Government is that of access by adults to education after they leave school, especially those who leave school early, and the report shows that we still have a way to go to match the standards set by many other countries. The programme for Government gives a commitment to establishing a &ldquo;second chance guarantee&rdquo; which will offer everyone who left school without completing the junior cycle the chance to participate on an adult education course.</P>
      <P>By contrast, Ireland's current output of graduates from third level is high by international standards, with this country coming seventh out of 17 in our ratio of graduates to the general population at that age and fourth of 14 in respect of holders of certificates and diplomas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report presents a wide range of indicators relating to expenditure in education. The data in <Col N="731" />this regard relate to 1999 and show how our overall actual expenditure on education has increased dramatically since 1995, with this country coming fifth of 23 in terms of percentage increase in actual expenditure between 1995 and 1999. Expenditure per pupil, in equivalent US$, at primary level in Ireland rose from $2,574 to $3,018 between 1997 and 1999 and our expenditure per pupil at second level rose from $3,864 to $4,383 over the same two year period. In the period 1999 to 2002 expenditure from the Votes for first level and second level education increased further by 51% and 44%, respectively. These continued increases since 1999 should help to improve the relative position of primary and second level education. I am keenly aware of the importance of investment at these levels in promoting excellence and equity throughout the education system.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, provides for the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance issues. The board is now fully established as an independent body and is comprised of people representing school management, teachers, parents, the school attendance service, the voluntary sector and a number of Departments with an involvement in child welfare issues.</P>
      <P>The board has responsibility for the development of a welfare-based service, accessible to parents and schools throughout the country. The new service is intended to take the focus away from the former prosecutorial approach to a welfare based approach, aimed at assisting children at risk and, in co-operation with schools, parents and other relevant bodies, to provide a range of supports and strategies to discourage absenteeism and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>An interim chief executive officer was appointed by the board in mid August. The board is moving ahead with the recruitment of its senior management and head office staff at this time. In addition, the former school attendance officers, and senior related grades, have transferred from the relevant local authorities to the board, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educational welfare service is a major new national service. The board, advised by its staff, will be developing and submitting proposals to my Department for the recruitment of educational welfare officers as soon as possible. The <Col N="732" />board, advised by its staff, will also be developing detailed proposals for the operation and phasing-in of the new service and these will be conveyed to schools when ready.</P>
    <P>The new service will be phased in over a period of time. As this is a major new service, with a new approach and new systems, it is not possible to be specific at this stage in regard to the timeframe that the provision of the full service will entail. It is, however, the board's intention that, in rolling out the new service, priority will be given to those children who are not in receipt of an education and to areas of high disadvantage.</P>
    <P>It is the board's intention, and mine, that the new service will be in place as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I want to make clear that EU procurement guidelines were fully followed in relation to the selection of the preferred bidder and a rigorous assessment process applied. Following an EU wide tender competition, the contract for the construction of a bundle of five post-primary schools under the first education public private partnership project was signed in November 2001 with Jarvis Projects Limited. The first of the schools was officially handed over to my Department on the 1st of this month, seven weeks ahead of schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to and during the process of selecting the preferred bidder, a project board containing representation from the consultancy team supporting my Department, which included financial and legal representatives, the Department of Education and Science, and the Department of Finance, undertook a rigorous examination of all the <Col N="733" />selected consortia bidding for the contract. Evaluation groups were established to assess the bids under design and technical, services, finance and legal issues. This process involved a detailed examination of proposals and a thorough examination of the companies ability to deliver on them. In addition, PPP schools in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland were visited, including some developed by Jarvis Projects, in order to access the quality of the product to be delivered.</P>
    <P>The project agreement between my Department and the operator provides a legal framework for the delivery of the required services. In addition, it provides for sufficient legal remedy should there be any failure on the part of the operator. These range from the deduction of part of the initiary payment to the termination of the contract.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the agreement includes guarantees for the rectification of the project at termination with no additional cost to my Department.</P>
    <P>The five schools involved were afforded access to each of the bid proposals and were unanimous in their support of the Jarvis proposals. The new service will be phased in over a period of time. As this is a major new service, with a new approach and new systems, it is not possible to be specific at this stage in regard to the timeframe that the provision of the full service will entail.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>I am very aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has moved to tackle the issue on a number of fronts. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social, personal and health education programme is part of the curriculum in every primary <Col N="734" />school at present and by September 2003 will be a mandatory component of the junior cycle in all second level schools. The content of the programme reflects current best practice in the area of educating children on bullying.</P>
    <P>As part of school development planning, schools are advised to have stated policies and to develop plans on discipline, health and safety and countering bullying behaviour. Parental involvement in the planning process is encouraged. Through their representation on the board of management and through parents associations parents can readily be consulted in the clarification and development of these policies and plans.</P>
    <P>Guidelines were put in place in 1994 as an aid to schools in devising their individual anti-bullying strategies. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents.</P>

An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of &euro;38.09 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to &euro;152,290.</P>
      <P>This Government is intent on implementing further significant increases in line with the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government. The Deputy will appreciate that this commitment relates to the term of office of the Government and its implementation will be considered in the context of the Estimates processes over that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of roll-out of the psychological service to all schools is directly related to the number of psychologists available to provide the service.</P>
      <P>The planning group that prepared proposals for the National Educational Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, recommended an overall target number of 200 psychologists, of whom about 180 would be in NEPS and the remainder elsewhere in the educational system. The planning group also recommended that this target should be achieved over a period of five years, beginning during the school year 1999-00. The Government made a decision in early 1999 that these recommendations should be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 43 psychologists already employed in my Department. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved <Col N="736" />the organisation of competitions through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are now 119 psychologists in NEPS, in addition to a number of psychologists deployed elsewhere in the educational system, bringing the overall total up to almost 130.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service and Local Government Commissioner have established a panel of 69 psychologists who were successful in the most recent competition. A total of 37 of these psychologists have entered the service since September 2002. My Department is currently making offers of employment to a further 13 psychologists, who are expected to take up their posts later this year or during 2003. A total of 16 psychologists, who remain on the panel, should also be made offers of employment during 2003. When these have all been appointed, there will still be a shortfall of approximately 30 psychologists, and it will be necessary for the Civil Service Commission to organise a further recruitment competition for NEPS. I envisage that the end of 2004, as originally scheduled, will see a full roll-out of NEPS.</P>

      <P>My Department has recently received a copy of the interim report on the facilitation process, which my Department supported and funded, with regard to Gaelscoil Thulach na nÓg. The recommendations in the report are being considered in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the report contains a recommendation that a convention on interdenominational education be convened by An Foras Pátrúnachta. However, the report also recommends that a preliminary step is required in relation to ascertaining the role of the churches to both the ideal and the implementation of an interdenominational ethos before the establishment of any convention.</P>
      <P>In the event that An Foras decides to organise a convention as recommended in the interim report, my Department would be happy to support this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disciplinary proceedings which arose in Gaelscoil Thulach na nÓg are employeremployee matters which are entirely for resolution between the board of management, the principal teacher and the patron body. They are <Col N="737" />not matters in which either the Minister or the Department can interfere.</P>
    <P>Primary schools are private institutions under independent management. The board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of the school and is the employer of the teachers in the school, including the principal teacher. The board is entitled to take disciplinary proceedings against a teacher if they consider that his or her conduct is or has been in some way unacceptable. Procedures are in place at local level for dealing with such matters and these procedures do not provide for the involvement of the Minister or the Department. In addition, an employee has recourse to employment law to ensure due process.</P>
    <P>The difficulties that have arisen in this school in relation to the teaching of religion are being addressed through the facilitation process. The interim report contains recommendations in this regard. Should An Foras decide to implement these or any other recommendations, my Department would be prepared to co-operate and support as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in my comments when launching the National Parents Council examination help-line, the receipt of exam results and the offers process that follows can bring varying degrees of joy or anxiety, celebration or stress. Times of decision are always times of stress. The most effective way to reduce this stress is to provide accurate information for students and their parents. That is why I was pleased to support the help-line operated by the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, which provided accurate, focused and specific advice.</P>
      <P>The public and media interest in exams and their outcomes is understandable given the high value placed on the leaving certificate but it can be overwhelming for students and tends to increase rather than diminish their stress.</P>
      <P>As regards reforming the leaving certificate, my Department has been engaged with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in an ongoing reform of the leaving certificate examination since the early 1990s. Revised syllabi have been introduced in the modern languages, gaeilge, accounting, business, music, mathematics, English, physics, chemistry, biology and home economics. The implementation of the revised syllabi has in each case been supported by extensive in-service provision for teachers. Other subjects will be revised in the coming years.</P>
      <P>As well as revisions to the established leaving certificate, new and innovative leaving certificate options are provided for students. The leaving certificate vocational programme caters for students who want a leaving certificate qualification that prepares them consciously for the needs of the workplace. The leaving certificate applied is provided for students for whom the established leaving certificate is inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The NCCA has currently in place a senior cycle review committee, on which my Department, teacher unions, school management organisations, third level education and the world of work are represented. When its deliberations are completed, comprehensive advice regarding the future shape of the senior cycle, including leaving certificate options and assessment, will be presented to me. The advice given to me by the NCCA will then be examined within my Department and discussed with the partners in education before any action is taken.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department that all teachers working with children with special educational needs, including those with autism, will have relevant training. In this regard my Department does not distinguish between teachers who graduated before 1998 and those who graduated after that date.</P>
      <P>There has been a major increase in recent years in the level of additional teaching resources made available by my Department to assist schools in catering for children with special educational needs, including children with autism. These additional appointments, however, bring with them the need for additional training in the special needs area and this is being addressed on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular emphasis has been placed on meeting, in a variety of ways, the training needs of teachers with responsibility for children with autism. My Department has provided a wide range of short intensive courses for teachers in this area, including a very successful e-learning summer course on autism which was available throughout the months of July and August 2002. In addition, a specially selected autism training team is, as a matter of priority, continuing its in-service programme in the current year for resource teachers in primary schools. Furthermore, my Department, in conjunction with the <Col N="741" />University of Birmingham and St. Patrick's College of Education, also currently provides a professional development course on autism for teachers dealing with this area of disability. A total of 75 teachers have already benefited from this valuable training.</P>
    <P>As well as availing of many other opportunities to enhance the knowledge and skills of relevant teachers in the area of autism, my Department has funded one of the colleges of education to enable it to research and develop an appropriate training model for the delivery of in-career development for whole school staffs. This work, which will be carried out in collaboration with other colleges of education, recognises the importance of whole school intervention for children with special educational needs and, in this context, will be of particular benefit to children with autism.</P>

      <P>My Department's higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.

The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents income or address.</P>

      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications not only for my Department but for schools, parents and publishers. I have asked my officials to forward a copy of the report to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its needs.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledges that many factors contribute to the problem and it therefore follows that any solution requires action not just from my Department and school authorities but from parents, publishers of educational books and from students themselves.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that my Department's campaign was a success in bringing about a heightened awareness of the potential problem of heavy schoolbags among all the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises the need to ensure that pupils in every school have the opportunity to become computer literate and develop the necessary skills for participation in the information society. Accordingly, it has been our policy to provide schools with the necessary computer facilities; ensure that teachers have the appropriate skills in information and communications technologies, ICT; and promote the integration of ICT in the curriculum.</P>
      <P>In furtherance of this policy my Department has since 1998 provided more than &euro;100 million in funding to facilitate the acquisition and development of computer facilities within first and second level schools. In addition, a range of support services, including teacher training programmes and innovative school ICT projects have been funded through the National Centre for Technology in Education as part of this initiative.</P>
      <P>The results to date have been very positive in terms of enhancing access to and the use of ICT resources in teaching and learning. A national census of schools undertaken in 2000 indicated that there were approximately 60,000 multimedia computers in Irish first and second level schools at that time &ndash; an increase of 65% since 1998. This translates into an average of almost nine computers per primary school, and 43 computers per post-primary school. Pupil-computer ratios stood at 18:1 at primary level and 13:1 at second level. Internet access has also improved considerably with all schools having an Internet connection since early 1999.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the report of the National Policy Advisory and Development Committee, NPADC, which last year undertook an evaluation of the Schools IT 2000 programme, concluded that the results of the programme had been very encouraging and indicate demonstrable progress in the development of ICT as a teaching and learning resource within schools. Marked improvements were recorded in the availability of the necessary infrastructure, in teacher participation in ICT training and in the active use of ICT by both teachers and pupils.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the report of the National Policy Advisory and Development Committee, NPADC, which last year undertook an evaluation of the Schools IT 2000 initiative. In preparing its report, the NPADC commissioned a detailed survey of principals and teachers in more than 550 primary and post-primary schools, as well as chairpersons of boards of management and education centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee's report, which was completed in late 2001, concluded that the very positive results of the survey had provided clear evidence that the Schools IT 2000 programme had been successful in achieving its main aims of facilitating the acquisition of computer facilities for schools and enhancing teacher skills and competence in the use of information and communication technologies, ICT. Specifically when comparing the situation to that which existed beforehand, the results were highly encouraging and indicated demonstrable progress in the development of ICT as a teaching and learning resource within schools. Marked improvements were recorded in the availability of the necessary infrastructure, in teacher participation in ICT training and in the <Col N="745" />active use of ICT by both teachers and pupils. The need for continued funding for infrastructure and teacher training was also outlined in the report.</P>
    <P>In December 2001 my Department launched the blueprint for the future of ICT in education, which informed by the recommendations of the NPADC report, sets out a comprehensive strategy for further developing ICT integration within schools at primary and post-primary level in the period 2001 to 2003.</P>
    <P>The principles underpinning this strategy are: a major development of wiring-networking infrastructure in all schools and the provision of enhanced access to the Internet; a significant lowering of the pupil-computer ratio; the further development of teacher skills in the use of ICT in the classroom; and the facilitation of software-multimedia resources development for use in schools.</P>
    <P>In specific terms, the strategy provides for &euro;78.72 million capital investment for first and second level schools; &euro;29.2 million for support services including teacher training; the development of ICT school plans to meet individual school needs, locally based teacher training, supports for special needs students; the development of education web resources; a new scheme of innovative ICT projects; collaboration with other European countries; partnership with the social partners, industry and the broader community; and feedback from schools to determine future priorities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the blueprint for the future of ICT in education has set in train a range of actions which will ensure the continuing success of Government policy in promoting the integration of ICT in teaching and learning at first and second level.</P>

      <P>In recent years a number of measures have been introduced aimed at ensuring that the level of error is kept to a minimum, and that where errors occur, they are detected and remedied as quickly as possible. In particular, leaving certificate candidates are now afforded the opportunity to view their scripts both before and after the re-marking process. In addition, a candidate who is unhappy with the outcome of the appeal process may get formal confirmation from an examination commissioner that all appeal processes were carried out properly. Examination commissioners are drawn from a panel of persons independent of the Department who are invited to act as commissioners.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year a working group, which consisted of some inspectors who are chief examiners as well as teachers who have considerable experience as chief advising and advising examiners, was established to conduct a comprehensive review of monitoring procedures. This working group made a number of recommendations, all of which have been implemented for the 2002 marking and appeal processes.</P>
      <P>In 2002 almost 60,000 leaving certificate candidates were examined in some 800,000 components leading to the award of approximately 390,000 grades in 31 subjects. It is acknowledged in examination systems all over the world that some level of error may occur, as examiners apply detailed marking schemes to student's work and particularly where the marking process is on a large scale. My Department is constantly reviewing its procedures to ensure as far as practicable that the number of errors is minimised. In the final analysis, however, my Department cannot guarantee a completely error free system but the objective is to minimise the potential for error and to ensure that when errors occur they are quickly identified and remedied.</P>

      <P>As part of a mid-year expenditure review initiated by the Department of Finance, my Department identified expenditure savings of &euro;52 million as a contribution to keeping Government expenditure within the limits set down in the budget and the Revised Estimates 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" />Apart from an increase in third level student registration charges, the savings arise in the main from a slower than anticipated rate of development of initiatives and new programmes in the education sector. The main areas involved were ICT and research and development programmes, teacher recruitment, school retention and back to education initiatives, access programmes and structural reform of my Department.</P>
    <P>The position regarding possible adjustments that may be required for the last months of 2002 is being monitored closely and is the subject of ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance.

      <Quest>his views on a number of recent surveys showing that students who attend fee paying secondary schools are more likely to go to university than those from other schools; the steps he intends to take to ensure more equal access to universities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent surveys, which highlighted that students who attend fee paying secondary schools are more likely to go to university than those from other schools. It is not surprising that the surveys would confirm this trend.</P>
      <P>One of the outcomes of the free fees initiative appears to be the notable increase in the popularity of fee paying secondary schools, with well off parents now diverting disposable income from an investment in their children's third level education to investment in a more privileged second level education.</P>
      <P>However, the challenge I face as Minister for Education and Science is to encourage and support an increased uptake of third level courses by students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who might otherwise not consider such options.</P>
      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling &euro;120 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, to tackle disadvantage at third level. In line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommend<Col N="748" />ations in the report, including special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as top-up grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
    <P>Following a recent review, I increased the annual income threshold for the special rates by 32%, a significant increase. For 2002-03, I also increased the special rate of grant to &euro;4,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and &euro;1,600 for students resident within 15 miles of college. As a result of the review, it is expected that the number of students qualifying for the top-up grant in 2002-03 will double to 7,000 students.</P>
    <P>A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. The total allocation for the 2001-2002 academic year was &euro;1.2 million. For 2002-03, I have increased the provision for the fund to &euro;2 million.</P>
    <P>Financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objective of the fund is to assist students who might, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education was that a National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education be established to ensure the effective implementation of many of the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>I have now given approval for the establishment of this national office, within the Higher Education Authority. I anticipate that the national office will facilitate the aim of increasing third level access by the three target groups, in partnership with my Department, the third level institutions and other stakeholders and agencies.</P>

      <P>In 1999, the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, entered into discussions with universities, which it considered had Gaeltacht areas in their hinterland. Subsequently, an inter-varsity working group was set up, comprising the NUI Galway, National University of Ireland, University College Cork, UCC, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, NUIM, and Queen's University Belfast. The working group produced a strategy for the development of third level education in the Gaeltacht. This was submitted to both my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, now <Col N="749" />the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of the issue it is clear that the implications of the strategy need to be considered prior to making a decision on the matter. An inter-agency working group comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Higher Education Authority has been established to oversee an assessment of the strategy. A consultant has been employed by the Higher Education Authority to carry out this assessment.</P>
      <P>The inter-agency working group has met on two occasions. At its first meeting the group decided that the original strategy document should be posted on the Higher Education Authority website, together with a call for public submissions. On foot of this decision, my Department wrote to all third level institutions, chief executive officers of the vocational education committees, all-Irish schools and Údarás na Gaeltachta requesting their views on the development strategy. A number of submissions have been received, which are currently being considered by the consultant to the group. It is expected that the consultant will submit a draft report outlining his findings following this assessment.</P>

The operator must maintain each school to the highest level throughout the concession period with all classrooms, laboratories, heating, lighting and all services available everyday. By requiring the inclusion of quality <Col N="752" />assurance procedures for both the construction of the schools and the 25 year service contract, and by ensuring that key structural elements have a minimum design life of 40 years, my Department is procuring an asset that will have a fitness for purpose at the end and beyond the concession period. In essence, therefore, the PPP project is a service agreement, with built in financial sanctions for any possible lapses in service, between my Department and the operator.</P>

      <P>The Government remains committed to continuing the work that it has started and to consolidate the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Government will be continued as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government. To meet our objectives I will be looking closely at the potential for using PPP mechanisms and the concept advanced in An Agreed Programme for Government of a multi-annual programme schools' modernisation fund to be financed through the National Development Finance Agency.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools, my Department has undertaken on a pilot basis a comprehensive inventory of accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey will be placed on a geographic information system database. My Department is currently undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine the exact nature and extent of the nationwide survey.</P>
      <P>The proposed standards will be largely based on the planning guidelines for primary and post-primary schools currently used by my Department.</P>

      <P>The charge referred to by the Deputy is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and student services. The increase in the charge brings the amount contributed by students more into line with the cost of providing these services. My Department does not have the institutional details on how this funding is allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1998 the Higher Education Authority issued to the publicly funded third level institutions a framework of good practice for the provision of student services within the charge. Particular reference was made to the principles of transparency and accountability. The framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate <Col N="755" />system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source. In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommended that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the charge towards examination, registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the Higher Education Authority reviewed the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the third level institutions in relation to the charge and advised my Department that it was satisfied that all third-level institutions have endeavoured to put in place arrangements that the Higher Education Authority considered to be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of plans by an organisation known as Family and Life to distribute information packs to post-primary schools. The consent of my Department has not been sought. I would point out, however, that private individuals or organisations are entirely free to write to schools without the consent or approval of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sex education in schools is normally delivered as part of social, personal and health education, SPHE. The introduction of SPHE, as part of the curriculum at primary and post-primary levels, represents the specific strategy being followed by my Department to provide young people with life skills and moral education. SPHE addresses issues such as substance misuse, both alcohol and drugs, relationships and sexuality education and suicide. In providing for SPHE as part of the curriculum, my Department is seeking to discharge its responsibility with regard to the educational dimension of children and young people's formation. Significant measures have been taken to ensure that quality SPHE programmes are introduced into all schools. However, I am sure that the Deputy will agree with me when I say that other groups, agencies and individuals also have significant responsibilities in the formation of <Col N="756" />young people. These include parents, church bodies and society in general.</P>
    <P>In relation to the contribution that schools may make, SPHE programmes that are planned and consistent throughout the individual school will enable children and young people to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and life skills that will inform their decisions and actions both during their time in school and in their future lives. As SPHE has a moral and spiritual dimension, its development and implementation are influenced significantly by the diachronic ethos and characteristic spirit of the school established by the patron bodies.</P>
    <P>I would expect that school authorities would consider any material received by them, whether from the organisation referred to by the Deputy or from any other source, in the context of their school policies within the area concerned. I have no plans to issue guidelines to schools on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 was signed into law by the President on 10 April 2002. The purpose of the Act is to set up a framework to enable victims to apply for compensation. The Act allows for the establishment of a Residential Institutions Redress Board. This board will administer a scheme to enable victims of institutional abuse to make an application for compensation.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Act allows the board to make awards based on a lower threshold of proof than is required in taking a case through the courts. An applicant is expected to provide proof of their identity, that he or she was resident in an institution, that he or she was injured while so resident and that the injury is consistent with any abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident.</P>
      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board is independent of my Department and therefore it is not possible for me to indicate when the board will begin its first hearings. However, the chairman of the board has recently given me a provisional establishment date of 2 December 2002.</P>
      <P>Following establishment day a process has been laid down in the Act which must be completed. When this process has been completed the board should be able to move swiftly into the hearing of applications. My Department will continue to assist the board in order to achieve this target.</P>

      <Quest>the reason residents and local representatives in a rural region of the border between north and south Tipperary were not told that 570 BSE infected animal carcasses were being stored in a warehouse near their homes; if he will provide an assurance that there is no threat to people's health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>BSE positive material is handled to the highest standards in accordance with the appropriate legislation and the recommendations of the EU Scientific Committee.</P>
      <P>The appropriate legislation is EU veterinary legislation under which the only approved means of disposal of such material are burial or incineration. My Department discontinued the practice of burial of BSE carcases in late 2000 and in the absence of any suitable incineration facility within the State, it has been necessary to make interim storage arrangements, pending a resolution of the problem of ultimate disposal of the carcases. Since that time, such carcases have been frozen and stored in a secure, dedicated cold store, owned by the Department and located in County Tipperary. The decision to discontinue burial and to put the carcases of BSE animals in cold storage was made against a background of considerable media and parliamentary attention in late 2000 and is a matter of public record.</P>
      <P>When my Department purchased the cold store in 2000, officials informally advised the relevant local authority and landowners immediately adjacent to the facility of the change of ownership and the proposed storage arrangements.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to manage all relevant aspects of the BSE issue in a manner which protects public health, animal health and the environment, in conjunction as necessary with other statutory bodies. In this regard, Ireland's handling of all aspects of BSE is subject to ongoing scrutiny from various perspectives by independent bodies such as the EU's Food and Veterinary Office, the Food and Safety Authority of Ireland and others and has been recognised time and again as comprehensive, rigorous and responsible.</P>

      <P>BSE legislation provides that farmers are compensated at current market value rates for animals that have been depopulated as a result of BSE. The compensation is paid to enable farmers to restock. Re-population of the farm is normally permitted 30 days after satisfactory completion of cleansing and disinfection so the farmer need not be out of business for a prolonged period. There is no legal provision for payment of other compensation in respect of BSE depopulations.</P>

      <Quest>why a person (details supplied) with a quota of 187 in 1998 is left with a quota of 62 in 2003; the facts and calculations which influenced this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21955/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the commonage framework plan the destocking percentage in respect of the commonage concerned is 32.71%. The person named held a ewe quota in 2001, including frozen quota, for 187 ewes and his bovine units in 2001 from the CMMS converted to 198.99 ewe equivalents, bovine units multiplied by 6.7, bringing the total ewe equivalents to 385.99, that is 187 plus 198.99. His total forage area of land accepted on his 2001 area aid application was 49.96 hectares including 28.67 hectares of commonage land. Therefore the stocking density for his holding is 7.73 ewe equivalents per hectare, which was obtained by dividing the total ewe equivalents of 385.99 by the total forage area of 49.96 hectares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on these figures the formula to calculate the destocking under the commonage framework plans was then applied as follows: since the stocking density in respect of the holding of the person <Col N="761" />named is greater than five ewe equivalents per hectare and the percentage destocking in respect of the commonage concerned according to the CFP is greater than 20%, the polluter pays principle applies before the usual calculation is carried out. The first formula to be applied is the stocking density in excess of five multiplied by the total forage area of the commonage land, that is 2.73 ewe equivalents multiplied by 28.67 hectares which results in 78 ewes to be destocked.</P>
    <P>The usual formula is then applied to the remaining stocking density of five which is multiplied by the hectares of commonage land and multiplied by the destocking percentage. All three land parcels declared are subject to the same percentage destocking of 32.71% as per the CFP. The second calculation in respect of the person named was therefore five multiplied by 28.67 and multiplied by 32.71% resulting in an additional 47 quota rights being destocked.</P>
    <P>The total quota rights being destocked in this instance is 125, that is 78 plus 47. Since the person named held a quota of 187 premium rights, his quota for 2003 will be 62 or 187 less the 125 to be destocked.</P>
    <P>Since the person named is not currently a participant in the rural environment protection scheme he will be obliged to apply to join REPS or the national scheme to be operated by Dúchas during 2003. Compensation for destocking is available under these measures.</P>

The herd was selected for producer inspection which was carried out in late September. Payment in relation to these applications will be made, as soon as possible, on completion of all appropriate checks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 April he applied on 45 animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme. A herd inspection was carried out on 25 September and four animals were not compliant with animal identification and registration requirements. This resulted in a reduction penalty which will apply when balancing payments are made in the new year. My Department wrote to him on 12 November and advised him of his non-compliance with the requirements. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days. His 2002 suck<Col N="765" />ler cow premium application is now being processed for advance payment but payment cannot be made until his area aid problems are resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 to 88, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government's position on Ireland's debt strategy for developing countries was prepared jointly by Ireland Aid and my Department and was issued in July. We concluded that, in principle, the total cancellation of the debts of the heavily indebted poor countries is a politically acceptable objective and one that we would support. Total cancellation would have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. To mobilise the necessary funds for total debt cancellation a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their overseas development aid more rapidly and take concrete steps to meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total cancellation of HIPC debts should be accompanied by strong monitoring and accountability mechanisms to ensure that the additional <Col N="767" />funds available to HIPC governments, through debt cancellation, would be directly channelled into increased social expenditure, particularly HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>While in principle we support the total cancellation of HIPC country debts we believe the additional donor contributions required to achieve this will be difficult to mobilise. The additional ODA commitments made by major donors, the EU and US, at the International Conference on Financing for Development would not be sufficient to cover total debt cancellation. These contributions will be used to fund a number of development activities and not just debt relief.</P>
    <P>The debt strategy document was forwarded to Ireland's representatives at the IMF and the World Bank in advance of the recent annual meetings of these institutions. Both executive boards are aware of Ireland's policy on developing country debt.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the debt strategy we have had consultations in Washington with the World Bank and the IMF. The Taoiseach reiterated our commitment, in principle, to debt cancellation in his address to the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in September. In October we participated in a World Bank meeting convened to discuss the current financing gap that has arisen in the HIPC trust fund.</P>
    <P>My Department, in close co-ordination with Ireland Aid, will continue to promote our views on debt relief in all relevant international fora. We will also continue to closely monitor developments in the HIPC initiative process and to participate actively in all relevant international meetings.</P>

      <P>Eligible students are those who are first-time undergraduates and hold EU nationality or have official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved course. This condition applies to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with a judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for grant assistance under my Department's maintenance grants schemes a can<Col N="770" />didate must meet the conditions relating to residence, age, means and nationality. The nationality requirement states that candidates must hold EU nationality, have official refugee status or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State. My Department proposes to review the nationality requirement in the maintenance grants schemes to ensure future compliance with relevant legislation, including the terms of the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>A number of tax relief provisions on the payment of tuition fees at third level have been introduced in recent years. Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from any tax office.</P>

      <P>In the areas of education and care, effective co-ordination with all relevant Departments and stakeholders is a key requirement for successful policy outcomes. My Department maintains regular contact with the Department of Health and Children on a range of issues in this regard. For instance, ongoing consultations are taking place with the Department of Health and Children in relation to an OECD review on early childhood education and care which is being co-ordinated by my Department. My Department is also participating in a Department of Health and Children review of the existing pre-school services regulations under the Child Care Act, 1991. My Department also regularly engages in exchanges with the Department of Health and Children concerning a range of issues of mutual interest including the provision of education and care services for children and adults with special needs. The two Departments are examining how improved co-operation and co-ordination can be achieved in such provision.</P>
      <P>Part of the remit of the national educational psychological service is to work in close collaboration with health boards. For this reason NEPS is organised in ten regions corresponding to the ten health board regions.</P>
      <P>During 2001 the management committee of NEPS established a working party consisting of representatives of NEPS and the health boards. Its purpose was to recommend structures and protocols for effective liaison between NEPS and the psychology services of the health boards. This working party produced a report during the summer entitled Achieving through Partnership. The report includes a detailed action plan for the establishment of liaison mechanisms at national, regional and local level, recommendations on suitable areas for interagency collaboration and an action plan in the area of human resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" />The report has been presented to the management committee of NEPS which has adopted the recommendations. It will shortly be presented to the chief executive officers of the health boards. Once this has taken place the report will be made available to the public. It is intended to begin implementing the report's recommendations in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Permanent exclusion from school is one of three categories of decision by a school's board of management that may be appealed to my Department's secretary general under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998. Appeals proceed through three phases &ndash; local resolution, facilitation and finally if a resolution has not been reached, to an appeal committee hearing. To date approximately half of all appeals lodged have been resolved at phase one or two and consequently have not proceeded to a hearing before an appeal committee.</P>
      <P>An appeal committee does not make recommendations on resource allocation. When determining a case of an appeal that is upheld it may recommend that an assessment be carried out. In instances where this has occurred the appropriate resources have been provided.</P>

      <P>The conduct of staff relations is a matter for each university in accordance with section 25 of the Universities Act, 1997. This section also gives the university the authority to suspend or dismiss any employee but only in accordance with procedures, and subject to any conditions, specified in statute made following consultation through normal industrial relations structures operating in the university with recognised staff associations or trade unions.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Higher Education Authority that the new disciplinary procedures in DCU were drafted under statute as required by the Act. These new procedures were prepared following legal advice and essentially elaborate on existing arrangements agreed in 1985. The university consulted its union representatives as required under the Universities Act. This matter was the subject of a conciliation conference in September and it has been referred directly to the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>My Department issued the 2002 schemes of student support to the awarding bodies, local authorities and vocational education committees, via electronic mail on 12 July. Hard copies of the schemes were subsequently issued on 15 July.</P>
      <P>Significant amendments to the application form and notes booklet for applicants were required in view of the short, transitional tax period, April to December 2001. Also, the process of printing and subsequent delivery of the application forms took considerably longer than had been initially notified to the Department. When my Department became aware of the delay in the printing operation the application form and notes booklet were issued to the awarding bodies via electronic mail. This was done to allow the option of issuing forms as early as possible to prospective applicants. A hard copy of the material issued on the same day. My Department understands that in most, if not all cases, the awarding bodies decided to await delivery of their printed orders.</P>
      <P>The awarding bodies process grant applications as speedily as possible and issue grant payments to eligible students as early as possible in the academic year.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the issue of bullying in schools. My Department has moved to tackle the issue on a number of fronts. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum.</P>
      <P>At present the SPHE programme is part of the curriculum in every primary school. By September 2003 it will be a mandatory component of the junior cycle in all second level schools. The content of the programme reflects current best practice in the area of educating children in relation to bullying.</P>
      <P>As part of school development planning schools are advised to have stated policies and to develop plans on discipline, health and safety and countering bullying behaviour. Parental involvement in the planning process is encouraged. Through their representation on the board of management and through parents' associations parents can readily be consulted in the clarification and development of these policies and plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" />Guidelines were put in place in 1994 as an aid to schools in devising their anti-bullying strategies. Their purpose was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in third level institutions and one maintenance grant scheme in respect of students attending approved post-leaving certificate courses in approved PLC centres: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>The higher education grant scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under these Acts a mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved third level institution. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. Similar provisions apply in relation to the other maintenance grant schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the means test provisions of the schemes the reckonable income of a candidate, other than an independent mature candidate, is his/her gross income from all sources, and the gross income of his/her parents or guardians where applicable. Certain specified social welfare and health board payments are exempt.</P>
      <P>A reduction in the age threshold defining mature student status under my Department's maintenance grants schemes would have to be considered in the light of available financial resources and other competing demands in the education sector. At present there are no plans to change the eligibility criteria in this regard.</P>

      <P>Work on a ministerial order under the terms of the Education Act, 1998 to establish a national council for special education is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in a position to seek Government approval and lay a draft of the proposed order before both Houses of the Oireachtas shortly, seeking resolutions approving the draft. In tandem with its work on the order, my Department is also developing the administrative and organisational arrangements that will be necessary to facilitate the establishment of a council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council will have two broad functions. First, it will have the capacity to assist educational providers and providers of ancillary services in <Col N="784" />developing and co-ordinating their activities at local level to facilitate the delivery of educational services for children with special needs. This will be achieved through the deployment of a network of special needs organisers who will also act as a single point of contact for the parents/guardians of children with special needs with the clear and specific objective of making appropriate educational provision for those children.</P>
    <P>Second, the national council will be responsible for the carrying out of research and the provision of expert advice to my Department in relation to special education issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaving certificate home economics &ndash; general &ndash; syllabus has been in existence since the majority of teachers in the system began their careers. The leaving certificate home economics &ndash; social and scientific &ndash; syllabus was introduced in the 1970s. Clearly, there are changes in society and in education that warrant a change in syllabus at this stage. The elements of the syllabi most in need of updating are in the area of food science and the legislation affecting food, resource management and social studies. Another change, much sought-after by teachers who found the old syllabi very difficult to cover in the time available, is the reduction of the two old syllabi to one, and the reduction of teaching time to 180 hours. This has been achieved by a streamlining of content and by the introduction of a strong element of choice. Perhaps the most important change from the point of view of quality of learning and teaching is the new emphasis on practical work in the revised syllabus. It is clear from the above that if schools were to continue to teach material that is now outdated and to use methods that are no longer helpful to learning, students would be increasingly badly served by the teaching offered to them.</P>
      <P>Inservice training for teachers of the revised leaving certificate home economics syllabus has been in place since September 2001. A seven-member support service has planned and delivered a programme that is offered to all teachers. To date, 80% of all teachers of leaving certificate home economics have attended round one of the programme, which ran from October to November 2001. So far, about 8% have attended round two, which is running at present and will continue up to 22 November 2002.</P>
      <P>This face-to-face delivery of in-service training was accompanied by the provision of draft syllabus guidelines available at in-service; syllabus guidelines issued to schools; teachers' notes prepared for the national in-service days which are available on request from the support team; materials available on the support team website.</P>
      <P>The Association of Teachers of Home Economics has consistently expressed its concerns over the last few years about the delay in implementing the revised home economics syllabus. I noted that the association had expressed its disappointment when the proposed introduction in September 2001 was deferred for a further year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must emphasise, therefore, that as the revised syllabus in leaving certificate home economics became the official syllabus on 1 November 2002, and since the infrastructure for the introduction of the revised syllabus in home economics is clearly in place, the leaving certificate examin<Col N="786" />ations in June 2004 will be based on this revised syllabus.</P>

      <P>In August 2002, the ASTI reiterated to its members that the directive not to co-operate with supervision arrangements would continue to operate from the new school year pending a consultation and decision making process with its membership. In the circumstances and in <Col N="788" />order to keep schools open, my Department agreed in discussions with the representative management groups, to appropriate arrangements being made by schools that would involve non-teaching personnel carrying out supervision duties, as appropriate. My Department, by circular letter dated 15 August 2002, advised schools of amended arrangements for the employment and remuneration of these personnel. However, schools were permitted to retain those arrangements that were in place for the 2001-02 school year for an interim period pending the putting in place of the new arrangements. For purposes of the temporary interim arrangements, payments have been made to schools by my Department, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,369 per whole-time equivalent teacher post per annum. In addition, funding has also been provided to cover employer's PRSI and holiday pay. Under the arrangements a payment amounting to 5% of supervision costs are been provided to schools to pay for additional support, including secretarial assistance.</P>
      <P>In aggregate, the sum disbursed to date since the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on 4 March 2002 amounts to some &euro;24.7 million. The temporary interim arrangements acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant.</P>
      <P>The terms of proposals made to and accepted by the INTO and the TUI in relation to payment for supervision and substitution are on offer to the ASTI. At a special convention on 19 October 2002, the ASTI decided to ballot the union's membership on these proposals. That ballot is ongoing and a result is expected in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146, 150,152,154,156,157,158 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has an extensive primary school building programme for 2002 under way at present, details of which are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</P>
      <P>Architectural planning has commenced for major building projects at the schools referred to by the Deputy except Tiermohan national school; Scoil Uí Fhiach, Maynooth and Scoil Clochar Naofa, Kilcock.</P>
      <P>Decisions on projects that are in architectural planning proceeding to tender and construction in 2003 will be taken in the light of the annual allocation for primary school buildings, taking into account the contractual commitments to be met on projects approved and the priority to be afforded to individual projects.</P>
      <P>In view of the extensive nature of the programme, my Department has no plans at present to start architectural planning for further major primary school building projects. My Department will be reviewing the position in the light of the allocation to be made for the primary building programme at the completion of the 2003 Estimates process.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, boards of management should ensure that essential health and safety issues at the school are attended to. They should therefore continue to use the devolved grant for minor works and if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, they may apply to my Department's building unit for grant aid.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the joint Oireachtas committee report on school transport were taken into account when my Department reviewed the guidelines regarding the travelling and waiting times for pupils on school transport last year. Following the review it was decided to reduce the maximum combined travelling and waiting time for post-primary pupils from three hours to 2.5 hours. This decision was in line with the committees recommendations and was implemented from January 2001.</P>
      <P>The combined maximum daily travelling and waiting time for primary school pupils is 1.5 hours. In the event of a breach of the guidelines being brought to the attention of my Department the case will be investigated in consultation with Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, this fund is the responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State at my Department. The objective of the fund for the development of targeted educational responses to certain children at risk is to develop preventive and supportive programmes, which are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. A key focus of the initiative is the empowerment of local communities to develop innovative and flexible programmes that address identified needs of intended participants. Resources allocated under this initiative are used for the provision of a range of holistic supports to enable pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to participate fully in school.</P>
      <P>My Department introduced a new initiative this year &ndash; the school completion programme &ndash; incorporating the elements of best practice established by the eight &ndash; 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative. The objective of this new programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. The programme encompasses both first and second levels and will be managed in each of the areas selected by a group of representatives of relevant local interests. The main features of the programme will include the development of: an early response to the educational, social and personal needs of specifically targeted young people most at risk of leaving school early; a collaborative response to early school leaving by primary and post-primary schools together with relevant local statutory, voluntary and community bodies; in-school and out-of-school support; holiday provision.</P>
      <P>The in-school and out-of-school supports being introduced as part of the remit of this new initiative include homework support for the 82 projects located in 22 counties invited to participate in the school completion programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, my Department is examining projects with regard to the funding available in 2002 and projects will be advised of the decisions shortly. Commitments for funding can only be given for one year. In assessing applications for funding, consideration is given to Department supported interventions already in place in the areas concerned so as to avoid duplication of effort and resources. Applications will be sought in 2003 from projects seeking funding and a selec<Col N="799" />tion committee will be formed to examine the applications. Allocation of funding to projects will then be decided upon in relation to the amount of funding available to the Children at Risk fund next year.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 the Government is providing a total of &euro;698 million to support research, technology, development and innovation in the third level education sector, RTDI. Within the overall framework of the programme, it is intended to provide support for outstandingly talented individuals and teams of researchers within institutions, and to encourage co-operation both within the institutions and between institutions.</P>
      <P>Research funding provided under the RTDI sub-measure of the NDP is not allocated on a regional basis. All funding of projects is based on a competitive process involving adjudication panels comprising national and international experts. The selection process is based on a number of criteria, including the academic excellence of the individual researcher project and the quality, relevance and technical merit of the project. These criteria therefore do not allow for funding to be allocated on an individual institution or regional basis. All awards are based entirely on the outcome of results of a competitive process, thereby ensuring that funding is allocated on the basis of excellence. Deviation from this approach would undermine the application of quality assurance and value for money criteria.</P>

      <P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.

    </Speaker>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and <Col N="801" />remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>

      <P>Sligo Harbour Commissioners are the responsible authority under the Harbours Act, 1946, for the management, control and operation of the harbour at Sligo. I am aware of the Sligo Harbour regeneration strategy report, outlining plans for the future development of the harbour which has been received by my Department.</P>
      <P>The report followed on from the Sligo Harbour Commissioners integrated development plan 2000-05 for which funding was provided by my Department. The issue of further funding presents serious difficulties given that this project was not presented to the Department in the context of the NDP and given the extreme Exchequer difficulties at present.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the KPMG review of regional ports and harbours which was published by my Department recommended that responsibility for Sligo Harbour be transferred to local control, namely, Sligo County Council. The intention of the review was to chart the way forward for all of the States regional ports operating under the Harbours Act, 1946 and to set out a long-term, coherent and sustainable development plan for their future and for the people whose livelihoods they support. It also sought to identify best development options, including local authority control, in terms of ownership, financing and activities-operations.</P>
      <P>Section 88 of the Harbours Act, 1996, prescribes the statutory provisions for the transfer of certain harbours to local authority control. In the case of Sligo Harbour I am empowered under that section of the Act to transfer by order all members of the staff and the property, rights and liabilities of Sligo Harbour authority to the local authority. Such a transfer requires the consent of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While no formal negotiations have taken place on the handing over of Sligo Harbour, my <Col N="802" />Department has met representatives of Sligo County Council, at the councils request, earlier this week to clarify the statutory position and progress the issue. It is my intention that transitional arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for regional harbours to local authorities, such as Sligo, would be effected as smoothly as possible with all stakeholders apprised fully.</P>

      <P>A grant of &euro;63,487 was allocated to the organisation in question under the 2000 sports capital programme, administered by my Department.

      <P>In the case of the technical requirements, my Department has only recently received from the club the invoices from the contractor in relation to the project work and these have been forwarded to our technical advisers, the Office of Public Works &ndash; OPW &ndash; for certification. The legal requirement in this case, of which the club was also informed in August 2000, is for a deed of trust, which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am setting out below the detailed information requested by the Deputy which has come to hand <Col N="806" />from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Since mid-1997 over &euro;171.45 million, £135 million, additional revenue funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of the child welfare and protection services. This has provided for a wide range of developments, including family support projects, preventive services and intensive community based services.</P>
      <P>Among such projects is the Edge project, a community based service in County Mayo which is specifically for young people who may otherwise require specialised residential care. The Extern organisation also provides a range of services for several health boards, including individually tailored youth support-care programmes, at various levels of intensity to meet the needs of young people both in the community and as an adjunct to residential care service.</P>
      <P>In the North Western Health Board region, for example, 22 children avail of the Janus programme provided by Extern which provides a range of diversionary activities, including residentials, day trips, activities, individual work and project work. The residential component of the Janus programme is delivered at the Youth Village, Roscor, County Fermanagh.</P>
      <P>Extern also delivers a Time Out programme which provides a residential break for children aged between ten and 16 years of age who are assessed by the referring social worker as being in need of time away from their presenting circumstances. The Time Out placements take place for up to a maximum of four days and are located at the Youth Village in Fermanagh. The Time Out programme is currently delivering a service to 44 children in the North Western Health Board as well as several other children in other health board areas.</P>
      <P>In the eastern region in the Northern Area Health Board, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, recently launched the national pilot of the Youth Advocacy Programme, YAP. The purpose of the YAP pilot programme is to provide a community based service for non-offending high risk young people, particularly those with challenging behaviour and serves as an alternative to residential care. The preventative and reunification services provided will aim to reduce the number of children entering out of home placement as well as reducing the overall length of stay of children in care. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Northern Area Health Board, Youth Advocacy Programme Incorporated, Extern and the Department of Health and Children have collaborated closely to put this programme in place and will oversee the pilot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital investment of approximately &euro;40 million is being made available by the Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or fostercare services. I have been <Col N="807" />informed by the health boards that facilities with 128 high support and special care places, including individual high support packages, are in place and 58 of these places are currently occupied. There are a number of reasons for this, including the need to introduce newly established units on a phased basis, refurbishment work and the need to recruit and train additional staff. This compares with a total of 17 such places in 1996.</P>
    <P>In the eastern region there are two high support units. The Creag Arann high support unit located in the South Western Area Health Board has six places, four of which are currently occupied. The 24 place Crannog Nua high support unit located in the Northern Area Health Board has recently opened and will be brought on stream on a phased basis. One of the three-eight place units is open and currently has two residents in place. The area board hopes to have two more residents in place by the end of this month and a further two by the end of February 2003 contingent on sufficient staff being recruited and trained.</P>
    <P>Also in the eastern region is the Ballydowd special care unit in the South Western Area Health Board which provides a national service for young people aged 11 to 17 years with capacity for 18 young people. The facility is currently undergoing an extensive refurbishment programme and capacity is currently temporarily reduced to six. Current occupancy is five and another five children are scheduled for admission in December. Following the very positive response to its recent recruitment campaign the South Western Area Health Board, which has operational responsibility for the Ballydowd service, expects that the service will be working to full capacity by the end of February 2003 when the refurbishment and recruitment have been completed. It is anticipated that the Ballydowd service will incorporate a &ldquo;step down&rdquo; facility with capacity for six young people in addition to the 18 places on site.</P>
    <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board area there are 20 high support places in four five-place units at Elm House, Drombanna, County Limerick, Green Meadows, Moyhill, County Clare, Cré House, Roscrea, County Tipperary and Brookside Lodge, O'Briensbridge, County Clare. There are currently three children in residence in each of these units. There are also five children being cared for in individual high support packages by the board. The Mid-Western Health Board will be providing five special care places for adolescent boys on behalf of the southern region, Mid-Western Health Board, Southern Health Board, and South-Eastern Health Board, in a purpose built facility which is due to become operational on a phased basis by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In the Southern Health Board area the Gleann Álainn special care unit for girls provides seven places, of which four are at present occupied. There are two high support units in the Southern Health Board area. Ard Doire is a five place boys <Col N="808" />unit with two occupants at present and Loughmahon which is a six place unit for girls currently has five occupants. The North Eastern, Western, North Western and Midland Health Boards have co-operated in the development of the 12 place Rath na nOg high support unit in Castleblayney. This unit recently opened and one child is placed there at present. Five places have been offered and are expected to be filled in the near future. The North Eastern Health Board also has a three place high support controlled therapeutic unit which currently has one child placed in it.</P>
    <P>In the South Eastern Health Board area there are 21 high support places in four separate units. In Sacre Cour high support services in south Tipperary there are five places with five occupants, in Wexford high support unit there are five places with two occupants, in Waterford high support unit there are six places with four occupants and in Kilkenny high support unit there are five places with five occupants.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board has identified a special care package which has recently been established to care for one child in County Mayo. Working with children with challenging behaviour is a difficult and challenging task. While health boards have experienced some difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably trained staff, progress has been made in this area through recruitment abroad and the expansion of training courses. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, a new career and pay structure for child care workers was introduced last year. This aims to ensure that more people are attracted into child care and to ensure that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level.</P>

This list ensures equity between the general medical services and drug payment schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available and deletions are notified. Applications for inclusion in the common list are examined on a monthly basis by the products committee, consisting of a range of representatives from within the Department.

      <P>
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>Monthly fee for once weekly dispensing</P>
      <P>(Total ingredient cost + (&euro;7.33 x number of prescriptions in month) + &euro;47.68</P>
      <P>Monthly fee for daily supervised doses, seven days a week</P>
      <P>(Total ingredient cost + (&euro;4.43 x number of prescriptions in month) + (Number of instalments in month x &euro;2.90) + &euro;41.01).</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>Whether pharmacists dispense on a daily or weekly basis and whether it is supervised is determined by the prescription written by the doctor for a patient. In addition pharmacists involved in the protocol may apply to the health board for a grant to assist in adapting their pharmacy to accommodate the supervised consumption of methadone on the premises. The participation of pharmacists in the methadone protocol is extremely important and I would encourage as many pharmacists as possible to take part in this successful scheme.</P>

      <P>At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review, known as the Moran report, was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards and as a consequence, structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service.</P>
      <P>The Moran report recommended that the current policy of having a consultant led service be continued and that each health board have a consultant orthodontist.</P>
      <P>In addition, the recommendations of the Moran review group were that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units, to ensure the continuation of a high quality service, and that the regional orthodontic units be involved with the dental schools in the training of specialists. These recommendations are being implemented as follows:</P>
      <P>The Dental Council has established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics.</P>
      <P>The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service: ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October last year, six dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North Eastern Health Board and South Eastern Health Board commenced their training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. The general objective of these training programmes is to educate dentists to become specialists in orthodontics with a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods. They are made possible by co-operation between health boards, consultants and dental teaching institutions. This year, my Department expects to fund an additional eleven dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications <Col N="813" />at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the specialist training in orthodontics of another dentist is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and is playing a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>Equally, the Moran review group recommended that auxiliaries be employed in the regional orthodontic units of the health boards. In order to enable the achievement of greater caseloads, the Dental Council has been approached concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics. This grade, to be known as orthodontic therapist, will act as a support to the consultant orthodontists, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic units thus enabling a greater volume of treatment. This scheme is presently being finalised in conjunction with the Dental Council.</P>
    <P>The Moran report advised that the health board dental surgeons refer appropriate patients for assessment at regional orthodontic units through the principal dental surgeon and that orthodontic services should fall within the ambit of responsibility of the acute hospitals manager in each health board. Both of these recommendations have been implemented and the development of information technology systems in the regional orthodontic units, which was put forward by the Moran review group, is under way.</P>
    <P>However, I am cognisant that these structural changes may take some time to impact on waiting lists and therefore, in the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.698 million was to fund an Initiative on orthodontic waiting lists, from which the Southern Health Board was allocated an additional &euro;1.191 million for orthodontic services including &euro;1.032 million for its orthodontic initiative. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" />Last June, my Department provided additional funding of &euro;5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The Southern Health Board was allocated an additional &euro;0.720 million from the fund to treat cases in this way.</P>
    <P>My Department does not routinely collect orthodontic waiting list data specifically for County Kerry. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to investigate the position for the Deputy and reply to her directly.</P>
    <P>Finally, the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has informed me that at the end of the June 2002 quarter, there were 2,932 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of 632 patients when compared with the end of December 2001 quarter. I am confident that when fully implemented the initiatives that I have outlined, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment in the Southern Health Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent report of the National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland: 1994 to 1998, Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival, indicated that Ireland had the lowest incidence of breast cancer within Ireland and Britain, close to the average incidence for the European Union as a whole. The report also indicates that there is evidence of a divergence between female incidence and mortality rates, with a significant upward trend in breast cancer incidence in women under 65 years and downward trends in mortality rates in all age groups combined. These findings may be the result of improvements in treatment and-or increased screening. There were no significant trends in incidence or mortality for women aged 65 and over. The clear margin between the incidence and mortality trends reflect the fact that survival from breast cancer is good. The National Cancer Registry reports that this divergence in the trends is expected to continue as a result of continuing improvements in treatments and also as a result of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme.</P>
      <P>The national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern health board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. To end August 2002, 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74%. To end June 2002, 544 cancers had been detected amongst the screened population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assur<Col N="816" />ance criteria and best practice. The board of BreastCheck has recently submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme. My Department is currently discussing the business plan with BreastCheck and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic breast disease services. I am committed to the national extension of BreastCheck and a decision in relation to this will be considered in the context of the overall investment programme for cancer services for 2003.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, any woman irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 212 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of health related services, including speech and language therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. The document referred to by the Deputy is being examined in my Department and its contents will be considered in consultation with the health boards.</P>
      <P>In relation to speech and language therapy services, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. The report therefore advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve the fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-04 academic year.</P>
      <P>Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published in April 2000.</P>

I hope to be in a position to provide the information to the Deputy as soon as the details are received. I understand from the health boards that the delay in the provision of OPV figures in this regard is mainly due to the difficulties encountered in acquiring up to date details from general practitioners. In relation to the follow up by health boards to determine the number of individuals who require revaccination following receipt of BCG vaccine which was subsequently found to be less potent than that which is normally administered, this process is ongoing. I would like to clarify that there has been no withdrawal of IT funding.</P>

      <P>The working group on child and adolescent psychiatric services established by the Department of Health and Children in June 2000 found that the prevalence of attention deficit disorder in Ireland can be estimated at between 1% and 5% of school age children, that is, aged five to 15 years, which is in line with the research findings in other European countries.</P>
      <P>The development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit disorder was considered by the working group.

      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann receives a subvention on an annual basis from the Exchequer in respect of the socially necessary but non-commercial public transport services provided by the operating companies. Bus Átha Cliath has been allocated an amount of &euro;55 million in respect of 2002, which represents an increase of over 300% in Exchequer funding since 1999. This increased funding reflects the significant expansion in the capacity and frequency of the services provided by the company, particularly at peak hours under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>A comparison with the levels of investment in other EU countries is not an appropriate exercise as such comparisons are misleading in that they do not take account of differing circumstances in individual cities. However, a comparative study carried out in 2000 by the department of economics, University College Dublin, of the levels of Government subvention in urban public transport in European cities indicated that Ireland &ndash; Dublin &ndash; had the third lowest average subvention rates for urban bus services. The study has not been updated since then to take account of the extra subvention now being paid to Bus Átha Cliath.</P>

      <P>A number of steps are being taken by my Department to address issues faced by those living in rural areas who do not have access to transport. One of which is the rural transport initiative (RTI), which was developed in my Department and is currently operational in a number of counties.</P>
      <P>The RTI is being managed by Area Development Management, ADM, on behalf of my Department. To date, eight community transport groups have received funding for the provision of local transport services and a further 17 groups were recently approved for operational funding under the initiative.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the RTI is to promote the development of innovative, community-based, pilot public transport projects in rural areas that would help to contribute to the development of rural public transport policy for the country as a whole. Some &euro;3 million will be spent on the RTI this year and a similar amount is earmarked for 2003.</P>
      <P>I understand also that over the last number of years Bus Éireann has introduced some 40 new rural bus services on an experimental basis in co-operation with local rural community development groups. These schemes, I am informed, involve the provision of a bus service one day a week linking villages and townlands with a county town or other large town.</P>
      <P>The report of an interdepartmental committee, established in 2001 under the chairmanship of my Department, with the remit of bringing forward options for the development of rural public transport policy is now nearing completion. I look forward to receiving the committee's fresh ideas in this area and I expect to be presented with the findings of the study before the end of the year. This study, together with the experience gained from the RTI, will enable me to formulate appropriate policies for rural transport for the future.</P>

      <P>The Government road safety strategy 1998 &ndash; 2002 states that international research demonstrates that alcohol is an important factor in up to 40% of road accidents. It is conservatively estimated that in Ireland alcohol is the primary cause of 25% of all road accidents and 33% of fatal accidents.</P>
      <P>Drink driving continues to present a major challenge. The number of detections remains consistently high and the results of the testing systems reveal that the depth of the problem is not diminishing. Some 12,864 detections for this offence were made by the Garda Síochána in 2001. This represents an increase of 58% on the position in 1998. Some 91% of blood and urine specimens and 82% of breath specimens analysed in 2001 by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety were above the alcohol limit for driving. Some 58% of blood and urine results and 32% of breath results more than twice exceeded the limit.</P>
      <P>Evidential breath testing, EBT, which was introduced in 1999 and involves the determination of alcohol concentration in expired breath, was operational in 40 Garda stations by the end of 2001 and is being extended to more stations across the country during 2002. It is intended to bring the total in operation to at least 60 by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In a move to further strengthen and support the detection and enforcement of the drink driving laws, the Road Traffic Act, 2002, extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen to include situations where a driver is involved in a road accident or where the garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed. This is in addition to the current grounds where the garda has formed an opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol. Breath testing on the basis provided for in the Act will ensure that we can use the resources available to us in an effective and targeted manner. Breath testing is carried out in a similar basis in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government includes a commitment that a three year road safety strategy will be developed. One of the areas that will be <Col N="825" />specifically targeted in the new strategy will be drink-driving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people would agree with the Deputy's correspondent that there is more crime in Dublin now than 30 years ago. This is deplorable but, regrettably, in no way unusual. Increased crime rates have been part of the common experience of the industrialised world during this period. To claim that crime in Dublin is out of hand, however, is unwarranted.</P>
      <P>There is, however, no room for complacency. There is a need for robust responses to offending behaviour and to adapt to changing levels and patterns of crime. In addition to the existing Garda powers in relation to public order, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, currently before the House will give the Garda significant additional powers to assist them in dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct which most would accept are contributing to street crime and violent assaults. The purpose of the Bill is to augment the law so as to tackle the problem of drink related late night disturbance and the growing problem of late night street violence which has its origins in or outside licensed premises and fast food outlets. It will apply to pubs, off-licences, discos, nightclubs, dance venues of all types, amusement arcades, chip shops, take-aways and mobile food vehicles.</P>
      <P>In addition, Garda operations which target such behaviour play a vital role in combating this type of crime. Operation Encounter is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community. Particular attention is paid to nightclubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there is potential for disorder. The target hours of the operation are determined locally based on the specific circumstances prevailing at each location. Particular attention is being paid to ensuring that the owners and managers of such premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public. Additional resources are made available and each regional commander draws up their own plans to prioritise the deployment of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will continue to focus on youth crime by supporting and developing evidence based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending by implementing the outstanding relevant provisions of the Children Act, 2001. I am continuing to support and strengthen the network of Garda youth diversion projects which increased in number from 12 in 1997 to 64 now. The continued enforcement of the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, relating to the mandatory temporary closure of pubs and off-licences where convictions for allowing under age drinking have been obtained is also a useful weapon in this issue. This has <Col N="827" />resulted in 129 closure orders against licence holders up to 18 October 2002.</P>
    <P>A major expansion of Garda CCTV systems is currently under way, with systems to be installed in 17 areas, including Ballyfermot, Bray, Clondalkin, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas and Tallaght.</P>

Discussions previously took place between my Department, the Irish Prisons Service and the probation and welfare service on this issue, but it was considered that the technology being used was insufficiently developed at that time. There were also a number of policy and practical issues which had not been resolved in some of the jurisdictions where these schemes were being piloted. The final report of the Expert Group on the Probation and Welfare Service in 1999 also recommended awaiting the introduction of third generation systems and continued monitoring of the extension of the existing systems in Europe and elsewhere. I intend to keep the situation under review in the light of international developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility for the general policy on intoxicating liquor legislation. In this regard, the existing legislation contains wide-ranging provisions designed to tackle the problems associated with excessive consumption. The proposals in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, currently before the House will add to those provisions. However, I will be considering the matters outlined in the position paper and consulting my colleagues the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science, who also have responsibilities in this regard. I will bring any measures which are considered necessary before the House in the usual way.</P>
      <P>However, it must be said that while legislative measures, together with initiatives such as the age card scheme, can help to curtail the problems of under age drinking, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. Dealing with the demand side of the under age drinking problem should not be seen as the province of the State agencies alone. It falls on all parties with responsibilities in this area, the drinks industry, the media, politicians, teachers and, in particular, parents, to play their part in helping to address the problem of alcohol abuse, with special regard to young people.</P>

      <P>Information is not available in my Department on the number of vehicles which have been scrapped on foot of failing the national car test, NCT, since its introduction in January 2000. No scrappage scheme has <Col N="830" />been introduced to deal specifically with the recovery and disposal of vehicles that fail the NCT. Issues in relation to the NCT itself are a matter for the Minister for Transport.</P>
      <P>Section 32(1) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, prohibits the holding, transport, recovery or disposal of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. This general duty of care applies, <i>inter alia,</i> to owners of end-of-life vehicles, ELVs. It is incumbent on the owner of an ELV to dispose of it in a responsible manner by transferring it to one of a number of facilities that have &ndash; unless otherwise licensed &ndash; been permitted under the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations, 1998, to undertake the dismantling and recovery of such vehicles. Under the conditions attaching to such permits, vehicle dismantlers or shredders are required to ensure that all hazardous materials and components &ndash; including batteries &ndash; are removed and appropriately stored with a view to ensuring their environmentally sound recovery or disposal.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are the designated authorities responsible for issuing waste permits. My Department does not have a national list of the vehicle dismantlers and shredders that have been issued with such permits. However, my Department recently requested local authorities to ensure that all vehicle dismantlers and shredders operating in their functional area hold the necessary permits or licences.</P>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 243 on today's Order Paper in regard to the proposed ELV management scheme which is being developed to implement the main provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles. As it is intended to implement the proposed scheme by means of a producer responsibility initiative, the costs involved will, in the main, fall to the motor industry.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problems associated with the misuse of &ldquo;company cars&rdquo;, that is, end-of-life vehicles, ELVs, which instead of being properly dismantled are supplied at discounted prices. One of the factors contributing to this phenomenon is the abandonment of ELVs by their last owners due to the gate fee cost generally associated with depositing such vehicles at vehicle dismantlers or shredders for appropriate treatment and recovery.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, IMVRA, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland, MRAI, and other concerned parties with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative to implement the main provisions of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles. A particular objective of the directive is to ensure that all ELVs are collected, dismantled and recovered by industry in an environmentally sound manner at no cost to the final owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These stakeholder bodies submitted an agreed initial proposal for an ELV management scheme towards the end of last year. This replaced earlier proposals by SIMI alone. Consultants were <Col N="833" />engaged by the stakeholders to assist in the development of the agreed initial proposals but a number of outstanding issues remain to be resolved. I am preparing appropriate legislative proposals to provide for implementation of the detailed ELV management scheme consistent with the requirements of the directive. The introduction of the free take-back arrangements for ELVs as provided for in the directive is expected to result in reduced numbers of ELVs being abandoned, which in turn should reduce the availability and supply of &ldquo;company cars&rdquo; for unsuitable uses.</P>

      <P>The shared ownership scheme offers home ownership in a number of steps to purchasers who cannot afford full ownership in the traditional way.

      <P>The present maximum loan which a local authority may advance in respect of the purchased equity in a house is &euro;130,000.

      <P>The operation of the essential repairs grant scheme is a matter for individual local authorities and the scheme has been designed to give authorities an appropriate degree of flexibility in its administration. Within broad overall guidelines set by my Department, it is a matter for each local authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in its area, to assess the circumstances of each individual applicant, to decide what works are <Col N="834" />necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants, to determine the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid.</P>
      <P>Local authorities receive a total combined annual capital allocation from my Department in respect of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes and house purchase and improvement loans. The breakdown of the allocation between the different schemes is a matter for individual authorities in the light of local circumstances. Apart from these allocations, my Department's involvement with the essential repairs grant scheme relates primarily to the recoupment of up to two thirds of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grant scheme is funded at local authority level from the authorities' own resources and within the amounts included for the purpose in the local authorities' own estimates of expenditure.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the amount of recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities has increased significantly under this scheme. Prior to December 1998, local authorities were recouped 50% of each essential repairs grant paid up to a maximum of &euro;1,143 in each case. Since that date two thirds of the amount of grant paid is recouped, up to a maximum recoupment of &euro;8,467 in each case. The amount recouped to local authorities under the scheme has increased from &euro;764,144 in 1998 to &euro;5,733,069 in 2001.</P>

      <Quest>the steps she will take to ensure that where a person is on invalidity pension and their spouse is on carer's allowance caring for the person, and they are in receipt of mortgage supplement, the said mortgage supplement will be maintained at current levels when subsequent pension or carer's allowance increases are given; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution which applicants are required to pay from their own resources, currently &euro;7.62. A person whose income exceeds the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, such as a person on a higher social welfare payment, is required to contribute the difference, in addition to the &euro;7.62 minimum contribution to his or her mortgage interest. A consequence of this rule is that, if a basic social welfare payment increases by more than the rate of increase in supplementary welfare allowance, the amount of mortgage interest supplement in payment to the person is reduced by the difference in the two increases.</P>
      <P>In budget 2001, however, a new income disregard in respect of pension recipients aged 65 or over was introduced. The amount of income disregarded was £5, &euro;6.35, and this amount was increased in budget 2002 to &euro;10 and &euro;20, respectively. This ensures that, for the people concerned, when increases in pension rates were greater than increases in supplementary welfare allowance, there was no reduction in mortgage interest supplement payments. Any extension of this approach to cover other categories of recipient would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
