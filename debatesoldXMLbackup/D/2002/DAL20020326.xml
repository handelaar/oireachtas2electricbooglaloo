      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced the appointment of a new Information Society Commission on 27 November last. It is being chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former president of DCU. The commission will act as an independent advisory body to the Government and draws on high-level representation from the business community, the social partners and Government itself. It will report directly to me. The secretariat to support the work of the new commission is being provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>The remit of the new commission is to highlight the challenges and opportunities presented by information society developments; to monitor Ireland's performance in its evolution as an information society, both nationally and internationally; to identify areas of co-operation with other jurisdictions, including establishment of links with the Northern Ireland information age initiative; and to establish working groups, as required, to provide expert advice on specific areas of public policy development.</P>
      <P>I understand the new commission is currently getting its work programme under way, including arrangements for setting up the working groups it has decided to establish. I am confident the new commission will play a key role in shaping the public policy framework for the evolving information society in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that five years ago the Government stated its ambition that Ireland, as a modern industrial nation, would lead Europe in information technology? Does he realise that out of 30 OECD countries, Ireland is ranked 25th, and that former eastern bloc countries, such as Poland, the Czech Republic and <Col N="98" /> Hungary, are ahead of Ireland in the league table for access to broadband technology? Against this background, will the Taoiseach explain why it took him 12 months to appoint the Information Society Commission, which had been vacant for 11 months? Will he assure people outside the greater Dublin area that they will still be considered competitive locations for inward investment, especially by companies that require access to broadband?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistic quoted by the Deputy is correct but it is one of many benchmarks. The OECD publishes reports about different aspects of information communication technology. The World Markets Research Centre, probably the best overseer of information communication technology, ranks Ireland sixth out of 196 nations surveyed in its annual global e-government survey. There are many other studies by the FT and the OECD that rank us highly.</P>
      <P>We are low on the list referred to by Deputy Noonan but as a small country we can quickly move into the top ten if we take the necessary corrective action. That action consists of three phases and it is important that they are dealt with for the future of the economy. The first phase, 1998-99, was to establish international activity between Ireland, the Continent and the rest of the world. That was achieved through the major developments carried out by Global Crossing and 360 Networks, two enormous projects that linked this island to the international stage. The second phase was to achieve public and private sector involvement at regional level. That has taken a few years but is being successfully put in place around the country.</P>
      <P>The delay arose in the final loop because the private sector, for reasons I have previously explained to the House, did not have the capacity or resources to do it. Two major studies were undertaken by Brian Thompson, a member of the Economic Advisory Group and a world renowned expert in the field, and by an interdepartmental committee. Both have reported and now the local loop around the country remains to be done. The Minister for Public Enterprise announced the commencement of that project recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked if resources will be available for the project. A sum of &euro;200 million, including &euro;60 million for the first 19 towns announced recently by the Minister, many of them in the Border, midlands and western regions, has been allocated for this purpose in the national development plan. The towns are Waterford, Wexford, Carlow, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Cork, Shannon, Limerick, Galway, Athlone, Mullingar, Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton, Roscommon, Portlaoise, Gaoth Dobhair, Letterkenny, Tullamore and Ballina. The money required for the 19 different contracts, &euro;60 million, is available and will be met in full by the State. The costs are mainly civil engineering costs as it is not a major <Col N="99" /> infrastructural project. According to the projections, the 19 schemes will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland and the other development agencies have identified 67 other towns which have to be done. While I hope some of the &euro;60 million within the &euro;200 million allocation in the national development plan will be used for this second group, it will not pay for it all. My hope is that the private sector will get involved and it seems from Brian Thompson's report that it will. This will mean coverage of a further 67 towns in the next three years, of which this year is the first.</P>
    <P>The report then identified 123 other areas with populations of more than 1,500 which should also be linked up within five years. This would also have to be partially paid for by the State. That is the overall plan and if we complete even the first part, we will go way up the league table. If we complete the second part, we will rise to number five or six. Therefore, we are in a very good position having done the groundwork in getting the international link.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to get into an argument with the Deputy on the matter, the idea that one could complete the local loop before establishing connnectivity with the Continent&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One can say anything as Leader of the Opposition. I am just trying to explain how the process works so that the Deputy will be sufficiently knowledgeable on it to be able to tell &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; how it works the next time he is asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that it costs three times as much to transmit a segment of data from Cork, Galway, Limerick or Sligo to Dublin than to transmit the same segment of data from Dublin to the United States of America? Does he agree that two issues are at stake, an affordability and an availability issue, because certain areas have no access to broadband while <Col N="100" /> in other areas, the major cities outside Dublin, access is unaffordable? Does he also agree that while we welcome the initiative by which local authorities will loop their major towns, to do this without having a regional network outside Dublin is akin to having a ringroad around a town and a boreen from the town to Dublin? What does the Taoiseach propose to do to ensure there is a regional loop network outside the main towns and certain local authority areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an affordability issue which will continue until we get the entire infrastructure in place. The Minister appointed an expert group to manage the regional broadband strategy, the one asked for by the Deputy. The matter is being organised by people from Iona Technologies, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, Science Foundation Ireland and the Department. The first two phases will extend broadband to one million people. What we are effectively doing is providing initial key regional towns with quality cheap access to the superhighway. The superhighway is there internationally and regionally and now it is there in the local loop. The initiative will provide the necessary boost to industry and, more importantly, to consumers and to education, and it will do so in a successful way.</P>
      <P>The project as announced by the Minister dovetails with the report of Brian Thompson on the Infocoms committee. That referred to the need for greater penetration to reposition Ireland in the light of the technology downturn and being able to pull in direct foreign investment into the regions. If we follow what has been set out in the two reports, allied to the initiative of the Atlantic broadband corridor, we will see an excellent roll-out of metro fibre rings as part of PPPs not just within the cities but, more importantly, as Deputy Noonan points out, within the regions. It will take time &ndash; there are 19 centres this year &ndash; but the regional strategy is being overseen by the Department with the help of outside experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's remark relating this distribution of broadband technology to foreign investment, does the selection of towns for broadband and the various phases reflect the Government's priorities regarding different towns as per the still unpublished and secret national spatial strategy? In particular, how was a selection made whereby not one town in Meath was included among the 19 towns of phase 1 and only one was included in the 67 for phase 2? Why is the county with the most rapidly growing population in Ireland the one getting the least priority as far as broadband technology is concerned, particularly given the critical nature of broadband for jobs? There is only 25% of the population of Meath employed in foreign industries while in Kildare, for example, there is 68% employed in such industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole roll-out is done in conjunction with the development agencies. <Col N="101" /> Those agencies would like us to have 67 towns included as they have identified 67, and the 19 towns are the first of those 67. The 19 are large centres where a big impact can be made in a prompt way, covering one million people. That is the reason behind this. Over the next few years &ndash; only three years are involved &ndash; we will have 67 towns. The selection was on the advice of IDA Ireland, the local authorities and other State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach blaming IDA Ireland for the fact that Meath is being downgraded in the distribution of broadband? Is it not the case that a mistake is being made? The Government and IDA Ireland are using 1996 census figures which completely understate the population of Meath. If more modern figures were used, at least three towns in Meath, including Ashbourne, would be in the first or second phase. This is blatant discrimination against Meath. There are four towns in Kildare and three in Louth included in phase 2, while only one in Meath &ndash; Navan &ndash; is included. That is surely not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the 67 towns, Dunshaughlin, Kells, Trim and Dunboyne are also listed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach played a major role in the peace process. His predecessor, Deputy John Bruton played a role, as did many others. We were promised a peace dividend, but that can only come about if there is infrastructure to facilitate job creation. Counties Monaghan and Cavan, which I represent, are not included in the list of areas to benefit from broadband technology in phase 1, just as they were not mentioned in plans for better roads and gas infrastructure. After 30 years of troubles, hardship and a lack of inward investment, can the Taoiseach outline when this region will be put on the map and given the necessary infrastructure, broadband or otherwise? We were promised public investment some years ago, but we are now told that private public partnership will be used. If this mechanism <Col N="102" /> was insufficient for the needs of the larger tasks, how will it be able to cope with smaller ones?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The State has decided to develop 19 priority towns in phase 1 as the private sector was unable to do so. Many Border towns are among those to be prioritised in phase 2, which will last three years. While every town cannot be included, a number of towns in Deputy Crawford's area will be included in phase 2 and 3, planning for which will start soon. The first 19 connections will be commenced by local authorities this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Public private partnerships were unable to do the major job, so how can the Taoiseach justify asking them to roll out the second phase? Can the Taoiseach tell us how that will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has set out how contracts for the first 19 towns will be drawn up with local authorities and the tendering process has already started. I am confident there will be no great difficulties. I have been told the process will take about six months after the agreement of tenders. While it is not a small job, it cannot be said that it is a large infrastructural task. The committee's report stated that it will take between six and nine months. Private sector funds will be needed to develop the full list of 123 towns. The reports of the advisory committee on intercoms and the interdepartmental committee, which involved IBEC, State agencies and others, agreed that State investment in this area would attract the private sector. There is every indication that this will happen after the State has shown itself to be the driving force behind the project. The committees reported an unwillingness to do what was originally hoped, as resources are unavailable as a result of issues relating to 3G licences and other matters, so we can forget about that. The State's seed capital will mean that 67 towns can be connected quickly and a huge part of the population will be covered within three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach explain why Tralee was not included in phase 1 of the broadband project, in view of the fact that it boasts one of the finest technology parks in the country? Does he agree that towns like Tralee and Listowel will find it increasingly difficult to attract foreign investment as a result of their lack of broadband capability and that they will be totally disadvantaged compared to towns in the vicinity of Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Listowel is also on the list. The achievement of the three year target may depend on the level of interest within the private sector. The national development plan provides quite an amount of money to act as seed capital. More work would have been done in this area last year, to be frank, had there been greater interest from the private sector. However, private investors are now showing an interest and a determination to participate in this project.</P>

Will he agree there is a particularly difficult problem now in relation to immigration, for example, and various issues that transcend Departments from social welfare to health, housing, integration and anti-racism?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues have long been identified in the Public Service Management Act where cross-departmental work is becoming more relevant. It was all set out in the SMI reports from 1992 to 1997. Arising out of that there are a number of Cabinet sub-committees and interdepartmental committees. There is one committee under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform comprising all the agencies under my chairmanship which meets about six times a year with all the agencies, reception and integration services, representatives of the health boards and all the Departments which deal with the asylum issue. The question the Deputy raises is whether that should be the responsibility of a Minister of State. There is no doubt it is an enormous and growing area across <Col N="104" /> Departments. The processing section which had 20 people five years ago now has 730. The section has expanded rapidly and affects the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Health and Children. Presently, the co-ordination is done mainly by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Ministers of State in a few other Departments working together. Whether a Minister of State should be assigned to a number of Departments to drive it is a fair issue to look at. I am not sure whether that would be much more effective because at present the Ministers for Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform have to deal with the issue. It is an enormous task and takes up far more time than would have been the case even a year ago. It continues to grow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs was appointed to two Departments &ndash; the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs &ndash; but chaired the European co-ordinating committee across all Departments and reported to the Taoiseach. Would the Taoiseach see benefit in heading off racism by educating the indigenous population as well as facilitating the immigrant population, not all of whom are asylum seekers? Many are here filling jobs that need to be filled while many others are training Irish people to acquire skills. There are dangerous vibes out there. For example, one or two candidates in the general election will fight on the immigrant issue. Will the Taoiseach agree, given the significant if not seismic change in emigrant and immigrant trends in the past decade, that we should take the matter in hand? He will be aware there are about 800,000 of Irish birth living in Britain alone. I am of the view that it would be useful, and I ask the Taoiseach to consider having a Minister of State at his Department to co-ordinate these issues and to deal with the matter within decent, proper and civilised parameters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked me to give consideration to the matter. I think the actual structure exists but there is not a dedicated Minister of State, as highlighted by the Deputy. Presently, the function is co-ordinated by a number of Ministers, including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The reception and integration agency which was set up in 1999 has substantial staffing and enormous involvement in the day to day issues. These are the people who are driving it and they are answerable to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I suppose the Deputy's proposal can be considered by a new Government.</P>

Work is being done by the health boards, the education system, where a very good job is being done, the Integration Reception Agency and people who are trying to help to find accommodation, provide medical services and give language assistance. All those agencies across a range of Departments are working extremely hard. It continues to be a very difficult problem. Sourcing enough accommodation every month &ndash; I think 1,200&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general recognition and expectation that a second referendum on Nice will be held in the autumn. As the House will be aware, I indi<Col N="106" /> cated to my colleagues at the EU Council meeting in Barcelona that the Government would seek a declaration on the treaty at the Seville European Council in June that would address the key concerns of the people prior to bringing the matter back to the people in another referendum.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of recommendations of the all-party committee which have been implemented and those which remain to be implemented, I refer the Deputies to my lengthy reply to a similar question on 21 November last in which I fully outlined the position. Since then, as the House will be aware, the seventh progress report of the committee, entitled Parliament, was published on 21 March.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply and following the statements we had on the Barcelona summit meeting of the European Union Council, does the Government intend to publish, within a very short period, a draft of the declaration it would seek to obtain from the European Governments at the Seville Council meeting later in June of this year? Arising from the Taoiseach's interview in today's<i> The Irish Times </i>in which he refers to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, doing some work on the European Union Bill, will the Government fully endorse the Bill adopted on Second Stage last June, nearly 12 months ago, and proposed by the Labour Party so that the context within which the promised second referendum on the Nice treaty scheduled for the autumn of this year can be clearly changed?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept it is not acceptable to put the same question to the people in the autumn, that it will have no prospects of success unless the context within which it is put before the people is changed and that that context requires the issue of democratic deficit and political accountability in this House with regard to dealing with Council of Ministers meetings? The European Union Bill does that. Does the Taoiseach agree we need to have a debate on the draft declaration that might emerge from Seville before the Seville Council? Will he indicate his attitude to those two components of changing the context so that we can have a successful outcome to the second referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree we have to change the context and I hope in a lot of the work, not only by Government but by parties and other agencies, that has gone on for the past six months that is being done in many ways. The IEA, students for Europe and other groups are doing a good job on that. The answer to the Deputy's two questions is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. On the declaration, I am prepared to consult widely on that issue. I have not yet decided in what forum we will do that, whether in a committee of the House, with political parties or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the draft of the declaration exist either in the Department of the Taoiseach <Col N="107" /> or the Department of Foreign Affairs? If it does, can it be published in draft form? The Government said it accepts in principle and substance the European Union Bill, 2001. The Bill addresses all the issues of accountability. Can it be enacted? Does the Taoiseach agree that following a general election in May and a referendum in November we will not have time to change the context unless we move now? Will the Taoiseach enable the balance of the European Union Bill, 2001, to be enacted before the dissolution of this House? Does the Taoiseach have a draft of the declaration that he would like to see in Seville? If so, will he publish it in draft form for consultation and discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A draft exists and has been worked on since I first mentioned it. There have been suggestions that there should be discussion on it by the parties to the forum and those parties not at it. It was quite clear that had we published the draft last week at the forum there would be some people waiting to attack it. There must be consultation but I would like to see it worked on further before it is released. My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs have discussed the draft.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has accepted the spirit of an enormous number of the suggestions made in the Labour Party's private Members' Bill. Other suggestions have already been made. It remains to be seen whether it needs legislation or if we can put as many as possible of those suggestions in place as soon as possible. That is our intention. If it needs a legislative base to do that afterwards, that is another matter.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach made any progress in convincing persons and groups who opposed the Nice treaty at the last referendum to support it next time? Have they given any indication at the forum that they may support it? Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to the allocation of resources to the opposing sides the next time the Treaty of Nice is put to referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No consideration has yet been given to the allocation of resources to opposing sides. All the parties and groups represented at the forum have agreed that they are in favour of the enlargement project. They differ on other issues but it is significant that all parties understand and give their support to the enlargement process. That has been warmly welcomed not only by applicant countries but by member states. The Nice treaty primarily deals with the enlargement process but there are other issues we have <Col N="108" /> to address. It is quite clear from the last five or six sessions of the forum that there are issues on which people will not agree. There are issues on which they will never agree. The forum has been useful in spelling out the arguments and cases where issues raised were factually wrong. Good points raised at the forum have been taken on board. It is clear that the ten countries will be ready at the end of the year to apply.</P>

        <b>: </b>What is the Government's view of the key proposals in the seventh progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution? Does the Taoiseach agree that the age for eligibility to stand for Dáil Éireann should be reduced from 21 to 18 years? Does he agree the age limit of 21 years is insulting and patronising to young people? Does he believe this should be changed forthwith?</P>
      <P>With regard to the Seanad, does the Taoiseach agree that a House of Parliament elected by less than 1,000 Deputies and councillors, a few thousand college graduates and the Taoiseach, who nominates 11 Members, is undemocratic, insulting and patronising towards the majority of citizens and taxpayers who fund the Houses of Parliament? Would the Taoiseach agree that the report's recommendations do not go far enough? Has the Seanad not become a vehicle for the major political parties to offer patronage to their members that loyally follows the Government line on every issue, as this Oireachtas bears out? Does it not need to be abolished rather than reformed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have commented already on the seventh report. With regard to the Deputy's questions, I have no problem with reducing the age limit from 21 to 18 since people vote at that age already.</P>
      <P>On Seanad reforms, I have no objection to northern representation, but I disagree with the Deputy's characterisation of the Seanad. As an Upper House under the Constitution, it has been reformed before and plays a useful role, which is not to say that no institution should be examined or reformed. We should consider the work of the all-party committee and the proposed reforms. They would make the house fundamentally different from the one presently constituted, as 48 members would be elected by popular vote on a list system, for example. Proposals for Seanad reform have been suggested over the years and people have different views on it. It is a useful House and this report can be used as a basis to reach agreement on the matter.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland representation, as I said, must be examined carefully. We want more northern viewpoints in the Seanad, but this has been done by successive Taoisigh in their appointments over the last 25 years and that has worked well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad is a consultative, legislative forum which works. The report has to be examined and <Col N="109" /> proposals made based on it. I am not against reform as I have made clear already.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>The Taoiseach stated there was a need for a change of context in the event of a second referendum on the Nice Treaty. Does he realise that the objection of many who opposed the first referendum was to the militarisation process in Europe? That was not simply an objection to this State being involved in a European Union army but a fundamental objection to the advancement of an EU armaments industry and an EU army, which is clearly the intention of some of the principals in Europe. Does the Taoiseach not understand that a mere declaration would only amount to this State saying we will step aside but will allow the project of EU armaments and an EU army to be created? The objections of some of us who oppose the militarisation of Europe are much deeper than merely saying this State will have a declaration that we will not be involved but we will allow others essentially to create a new monster in the global context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered these questions previously for the Deputy. The reality is that there are references to European security and defence issues, which many people want to see addressed, as well as the question of the Petersberg Tasks and humanitarian and crisis management issues. Where people are under threat, through ethnic cleansing or whatever, decisions could be made on a case by case basis and these issues dealt with. A large number of people want that. I know the Deputy is against any European security and defence policy. His position is that we should not be involved in that in any way and when a crisis arises, Europe should not play any role but simply whinge that nobody is doing anything about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share that view. It is not the way we should go forward. People here want to play their role. They do not want to be an aggressor but they want to be involved in peacekeeping missions. We have a triple lock system in place in terms of how that is controlled. There must be a UN mandate, it has to be a decision of this House and it must come within the remit of our Defence Acts.</P>
      <P>I have not heard anybody advocate that we should take an adversarial attitude to European security and defence. I do not know the reason some people advocate that because there is no danger of it happening. No decision has been taken in that regard but others say that because people put forward that approach it requires clarification. The declaration will ensure that our position on military neutrality&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not sure if Deputy Higgins attended the meeting last week but I noted that as soon as we moved on to the declaration, the ground shifted to something else. That goes back to the reply I gave earlier to Deputy Quinn, although I agree with him on the declaration. In fairness, since the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties, the process of European security and defence has been spelled out and we now have to ensure that people understand it. It removes references to the Western European Union. Some years ago, people here were saying that the Nice treaty might remove those references. It is important that our position is spelled out in the declaration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that references to the militarisation of Europe are misleading? Will he agree that it is an historical fact that since 1914, Europe has engaged in less military activity than is currently the case? Not long ago there were three military dictatorships in southern Europe. Until 1989, there was a military divide across the continent, the spend as a percentage of the national economies and the GDP of the European Union countries was much higher on military affairs than is currently the case and a number of countries maintained conscription as a manifestation of the level of militarisation that existed in Europe at that time.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is misleading to refer to the militarisation of Europe at a time when all the objective facts show that the intensification of military activity is going in the opposite direction to the one Deputy Higgins described?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Commission on 31 January last formally adopted its decision to amend Ireland's MGP. The decision credits the Irish pelagic segment with increased capacity and effort to take account of additional fishing opportunities in Mauritanian and other West African waters. This follows the successful conclusion of negotiations with the Commission and has enabled the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> to be fully licensed and registered as part of the Irish pelagic fleet. The <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> was officially registered on the EU fishing fleet registry last week. As part of the overall agreement the Atlantic Dawn Company has permanently withdrawn the MFV<i> Veronica</i> from the Irish-EU fishing fleet. This represents a significant contribution by the company to resolving the outstanding power over-capacity in the Irish pelagic segment. The Commission's agreement to facilitate the introduction of the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> was subject to resolution of the over-capacity problem in the pelagic segment.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall package, the company retains its annual quota and fishing effort entitlements in EU waters associated with the <i>Veronica</i>. The company will utilise the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> to take up those entitlements within Ireland's pelagic fishing effort objectives for EU waters which remain unchanged. The company will continue to primarily focus its attention on developing sustainable fishing opportunities outside the EU and positioning itself as a successful player in the international seafood market.</P>
      <P>The outcome of these prolonged and complex negotiations is a satisfactory and balanced agreement. I welcome the Commission's decision as an acknowledgement of the legitimate potential of the Irish fishing industry to develop sustainable fishing opportunities at international level. These have traditionally been the preserve of other EU and third country players. I stress that the involvement of Irish and other EU fishing vessels in the fisheries of developing countries must be based on sustainability of the fish stocks in question as well as those of the indigenous communities. I fully agree with the Commission on the need for close alignment between fisheries policy objectives and development policy aims. In that context, I welcome the fact that the EU's Fishing Agreement with the Republic of Mauritania has set up a joint scientific committee which is monitoring closely the situation of pelagic stocks.</P>

      <P>Am I right in believing it is without precedent that the licensing and granting of a quota to one specific vessel has been the subject of so much effort by the Government in direct contact with the European Commission? Why was it felt necessary to go to these extraordinary lengths when the company that owns the vessel in question already has a vessel fishing in Irish waters with a quota attached, to which apparently the vessel in question will now be entitled, that is, it will be active in Irish waters taking up the quota that was previously available to the <i>Veronica</i>? In the context of there being tonnage available on the Irish market, to which I will refer later, why was it felt necessary to negotiate a special deal for this vessel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has a policy of encouraging the Irish fishing industry to expand into the international fishing sector. We are currently developing a comprehensive policy along those lines. That is in order to give the Irish fishing fleet an opportunity to expand into international waters. We are one of the only major fishing countries in Europe that has not developed in that direction up to now. In our first application to the European Commission we got an increase in our capacity to allow for this vessel. Without being in a position to reduce our MAGP capacity, the Commission was not prepared to licence this vessel. It was necessary for the owner to remove his other vessel, the <i>Veronica</i>,<i></i>in order to create sufficient MAGP capacity. In doing so, he contributed to a reduction in our MAGP capacity. There is nothing untoward or other than good in encouraging the Irish fleet to expand into the international sector. I am currently engaged in trying to encourage other Irish fishery owners to consider international fishing opportunities, particularly in the context of the reduction in quotas and the tightening situation with regard to a series of species within EU waters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that there will have been no reduction in the Irish fishing efforts? Is it not the case that the transfer of the quota, previously allocated to the <i>Veronica</i>, to this vessel to fish in Irish waters means there is no reduction in Irish fishing effort? What controls will be put in place to ensure that only that quota is taken up by this vessel? Does the Minister not believe it would be more valuable to the Irish fishing sector to improve the access of Irish fishermen to fishing in Irish waters than to go to these extraordinary lengths just to gain access to Mauritanian waters?</P>

      <P>There is neither an increase nor a decrease in the Irish fishing effort in the sense that the exact tonnage that applied to the <i>Veronica</i> will now apply to this boat. It was not ever intended that there would be a reduction. The important prerogative from our point of view is that there is no increase. There will be close monitoring of this vessel in respect of its activity in EU waters. I assure the Deputy that we will ensure that this vessel catches only its quota. That applies to other similar EU vessels which operate in this manner.</P>

      <P>The provision of essential facilities at ports, including infrastructure and navigable channels, of its nature necessitates impacting on the local environment.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the requirements of the specific EU directives referred to by the Deputy, each port company is statutorily obliged under the Harbours Act, 1996, as a general duty, <i>inter alia</i>, to have due regard to the consequences of its activities on the environment, the heritage, whether natural or man-made, relating to its harbour and the amenities generally in the vicinity of its harbour.</P>
      <P>In addition, as an integral element of their strategic development plans, port companies must ensure development projects have full regard to compliance with all relevant EU directives.

    </Speaker>
    <P>More than &euro;220 million has been invested in port facilities under the National Development Plan 1994-1999. A targeted capital investment programme at seaports, to address identified future capacity deficiencies and infrastructural needs, is incorporated into the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and &euro;180 million of essential investment is planned under the proposed measure. This will fulfil the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium for continued investment in necessary infrastructure to handle ever increasing volumes of tourism and trade. Exchequer funding of &euro;58.4 million is provided towards this investment through the seaports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional operational programme under two sub-measures, seaport infrastructure and capacity development and disengagement. Some 68 project bids were received with a nomi<Col N="114" /> nal value of &euro;331 million, leaving the measure heavily over-subscribed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I announced an allocation of &euro;1.664 million, under the infrastructure measure of the BMW regional operational programme of the national development plan, to Drogheda Port Company last December in respect of the completion of phase one of the Tom Roes Point development.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>A total of &euro;3.048 million was allocated under the equivalent measure of the southern and eastern regional operational programme to the Port of Waterford Company in respect of cranage and handling equipment at Belview Port. I expect to be in a position to announce a second round of grant aid allocations for commercial seaport development in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the amounts of vessel tonnage available for sale to fishermen on the current level of prices and on the level of demand for tonnage; his proposals to intervene in the market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Reliable data on the amount of tonnage capacity on the market is not readily available. Current fishing vessel licensing policy requires that 100% replacement capacity must be removed from the fishing boat register before a boat can be introduced. This policy reflects legal EU restrictions on the capacity of the fishing fleet in terms of both tonnage and engine power. National and EU fleet obligations for the last decade have therefore made replacement capacity a saleable commodity and created a lively market for it. Replacement capacity, for individual use or onward sale, becomes available when the owner of a registered fishing vessel removes it from the fishing boat register. There are currently no limits on the length of time for which capacity may be retained off the register. It is therefore difficult to gauge how much tonnage is either currently available on the market or may become available.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the current commercial market price is about &euro;4,000 per tonne in the polyvalent, or whitefish, fleet segment. The high price reflects commercial demand. Demand has been particularly buoyant since the introduction of the whitefish fleet renewal scheme in 1998. This trend is continuing due to the new whitefish fleet renewal and modernisation schemes for that sector. The new inshore fleet licensing scheme would create further limited market demand for tonnage. I am reviewing the scheme and will be discussing with the EU Commission scope for reducing the replacement capacity requirement to 50% under this scheme in the context of the creation of a new inshore fleet segment. This would reduce the overall cost to the fishermen in question.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for the State to intervene in the tonnage market to try to drive the cost down. The use of public aid to subsidise the cost of tonnage purchase is not permitted under EU regulations. Any capacity removed with public grant assistance is not generally permitted to be reintroduced into the fleet. The only mechanism for State intervention in the tonnage market is through decommissioning. This involves the payment of premiums to vessel owners to remove their vessels definitively from the fishing boat register and permanently decommission them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Capacity associated with these vessels may not be redeployed in the fleet. The current grant aid rates for decommissioning which are set down in EU regulations suggest that a State decommissioning initiative would find it difficult to com<Col N="116" /> pete with private enterprise in the tonnage market. A number of member states, including Ireland, have highlighted the need to review the rates at EU level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I infer that the Minister thinks it would not be appropriate for the State to intervene in the market to drive down prices. Does he think it appropriate, wise or fair to intervene in the market in a way that is bound to drive up prices? Is the Minister not aware that his recent half-baked proposals on the licensing of inshore fishing boats will create extra demand by requiring that people acquire tonnage for the first time? Any effect this has on the market will be to drive the price to above the &euro;4,000 per tonne which he mentioned. Is he now saying that he is not yet in a position to offer the modified scheme which he announced recently, under which he was to seek a replacement tonnage requirement of 50% rather than 100%, and that therefore the whole proposal he has made for the licensing of inshore boats must be put on ice until some response comes from the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite an amount of tonnage has been purchased on the market by small inshore fishermen since we introduced the concept of this scheme and it has not driven up the cost of tonnage because the amount of tonnage which will be required is quite small in comparison with the total tonnage requirement. I am quite satisfied and the advice available to me is that the requirement for small inshore fishermen to acquire tonnage will not drive up prices.</P>
      <P>When the scheme was first introduced we wanted to provide a scheme under which small fishermen would pay the full cost of tonnage but it became evident that that was not acceptable to fishermen around the coast. We have now decided to amend that scheme to allow for a 50% replacement requirement. However, this is subject to EU Commission approval which we are currently seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister obtains EU approval for the 50% tonnage requirement, what will the Minister say to inshore fishermen who, after his first announcement, went out and bought tonnage at the current level of &euro;4,000 per tonne and who will now find themselves competing with people who can buy double the amount of tonnage at that rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Commission approves the measure, those fishermen who have purchased tonnage will only be required, when they register, to have half the tonnage they expected to get in the proposed new inshore sector. However, those who are already in the inshore sector must be considered. They have tonnage with an existing value. This is one of the factors which must be discussed with the EU because we do not want to reduce the value of tonnage and licences held by existing inshore fishermen. One aspect of this <Col N="117" /> debate which has not been discussed is that there are several thousand inshore fishermen who are legally registered and have purchased tonnage. They are a silent majority who have been urging me not to give out tonnage free. That is what the Deputy and his party were urging me to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given priority to the development of a new management and conservation framework for inshore fisheries. My objective is to ensure that inshore stocks are conserved and developed on a sustainable basis with the full involvement of all fishermen. As part of developing the new framework, BIM carried out a survey of inshore fishing activity around the coast. The survey found that a number of traditional inshore fishermen remained outside the licensing and registration system. Under national and EU law all sea-fishing boats are required to be licensed and registered. In the context of the new initiatives, it was clear that bona fide fishermen who remained outside the system for whatever reason should be given an opportunity to regularise their situation. I accordingly intro<Col N="118" /> duced a new licensing scheme which would bring all fishermen into the framework. To facilitate their participation, the scheme offered fishermen the option of phasing their purchase of tonnage in three instalments.</P>
      <P>We subsequently held a series of information meetings on the scheme. Reservations were expressed by a number of fishermen, principally on the grounds of affordability of tonnage and power. Opposition has also been expressed by licensed fishermen to the prospect of free access being given to those outside the system. Having reviewed all the concerns, I have decided to seek the approval of the EU Commission to an amended scheme. This would require fishermen to provide a maximum of 50% replacement capacity in the possible context of a stand alone inshore fleet segment. I will be concerned to ensure the assets of the vast majority of inshore fishermen already licensed and registered will not be negatively affected. My Department and BIM are reviewing inshore fleet frameworks in other EU member states which will usefully inform our discussions with the Commission.</P>
      <P>I am revisiting, not abandoning, the new scheme and in doing so I am responding positively to the concerns raised. We must work to have inshore boats licensed and registered, as required under EU rules, and ensure inclusive participation in new inshore fisheries initiatives. The new strategic approach to the inshore sector, of which the inshore licensing scheme is one component, will have a very positive impact for coastal communities. Its success will, however, depend on the involvement and co-operation of all fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the serious unrest among inshore fishermen? Does he have his ear to the ground regarding fisheries policy in Ireland? It is clearly evident, in southwest Cork and south Kerry, that small inshore fishermen cannot afford to pay the required &euro;4,000 per tonne to register their boats. In France, an inshore fisherman with a boat of less than 12 metres can register and license his boat at a cost of &euro;120 per year. It costs &euro;180 to have a boat licensed in Spain. We must give some concession to the small inshore fisherman who is merely trying to make a living. Surely such fishermen should receive special concessions.</P>
      <P>I ask that the Minister scrap the tonnage system for boats under 12 metres. Such fishermen, who are the backbone of the inshore fishing industry here, will find it hard to digest the fact that the Minister received an extra 14,000 tonnes for the Irish fleet and awarded it to one trawler owner. There is widespread concern about this issue. There is no way inshore fishermen, who can fish only a couple of days a year due to bad weather, can afford to pay &euro;4,000 per tonne for fishing a punt or a half-deck trawler.</P>

Two years ago, before I took office, only £80,000 was spent in this area &ndash; only £20,000 was spent in this area by the Deputy's party when in Government. I invested £2 million in inshore fishing last year. This year, I intend to invest &euro;3 million. For the first time ever, we are giving all genuine and serious fishermen in the inshore fishing fleet the opportunity to get involved in a management and conservation programme.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of genuine fishermen have welcomed this scheme and a number of people from Deputy Sheehan's constituency in west Cork have applied to take part in it, as have fishermen in west Kerry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fundamental tenet of Ireland's negotiating position that the Common Fisheries Policy must take account of the social and economic dimension of fisheries. We will continue to push for full recognition of the social and regional dimension in the negotiations on the Commission's formal proposals on CFP reform which are expected shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The socio-economic dimension of fisheries policy has featured strongly in the debate on the Commission's Green Paper. In line with the position of the national CFP strategy review group, I <Col N="120" /> have underlined to Commissioner Fischler and the Council that the CFP must be aligned with social, regional and cohesion policies to safeguard the interests of coastal and fishing regions. I have been joined by a number of EU colleagues in emphasising that the Commission's focus on the sustainability of resources must be balanced by recognition of the social, economic and safety aspects of sustainable fisheries development. We believe that the Commission's thinking, as flagged in the Green Paper, is significantly deficient on these critical dimensions.</P>
    <P>To influence the Commission's thinking and that of other member states, I have worked with like-minded colleagues in Europe to highlight the socio-economic dimension of fisheries policy. Ireland, France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal presented a set of common conclusions to the Commissioner and other member states last December. This common strategic approach is being maintained in the interests of driving the socio-economic and safety agenda. I stress that this tactical alliance does not extend to all aspects of CFP reform. Ireland will vigorously negotiate and defend our strategic priorities in relation to the Hague Preference, the Irish Box and access to resources generally where we are likely to part company with Spain and France in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister that the future for fisheries in this country is bright. Is he aware that since Ireland joined the EU, optimism of coastal communities along the entire seaboard has been eroded? The Common Fisheries Policy is one of only two common policies in the EU yet it operates contrary to social and cohesion policies. This is extremely apparent from the outcome of the December Fisheries Council where the European Commission backed bigger member states in trying to take away the small piece of cake which Ireland had in the Hague Preference. Can the Minister give an assurance that the fisheries policy being drafted will aid Ireland to obtain a greater slice of the European fisheries cake? What will be done to ensure fish stocks are maintained? If the EU Commission does not adopt a policy to preserve stocks, the north Atlantic Ocean will be denuded of fish within ten years. The Spaniards, French and Portuguese can sweep up as much fish as they like in our waters and return to their countries loaded to the gunnels.</P>

A sincere effort is being made to put a stronger conservation policy in place.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy there is constant pressure on stocks from various EU fleets.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office in January 2000 I have received many representations from, and met, delegations of salmon fishermen, both commercial and recreational anglers. These have included the North West Salmon Netsmen Association. The topics which have been covered in these contacts have included the current effort limitation regime in regard to commercial salmon fishing, the other restrictions related to the angling sector and the proposed introduction in 2002 and beyond of fishery district quotas for taking salmon by commercial fishing engines. These ongoing contacts have served to reinforce my commitment to the future development of both the commercial fishery and the recreational fishery for salmon. They have also allowed me to explain to the commercial fishermen the need to have increasing regard to the position of salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>I wish to see a sustainable fishery based on quality and value rather than volume in the commercial sector while for the angling sector I wish to see investment in the ongoing development of angling as a valued pastime and as an important tourism product.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute advises me that average salmon spawning escapement is below the conservation limit in nine of the 17 fishery districts in the State. This means that in those nine districts the stock levels have dropped below the optimum carrying capacity of the catchment within those districts and, in others, to levels where the viability of the river catchments is threatened. Accordingly, on the basis of the best scientific and fisheries management advice available, I have decided to act now with the objective of improving spawning escapement which will I hope, lead to a restoration of adult salmon returns to the Irish coast in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into account socio-economic factors affecting coastal communities, it is proposed to moderate the proposed reductions in commercial catches from the scientific recommendation of approximately 34%. In formulating these proposals I have considered the arguments of those <Col N="123" /> groups, at home and abroad, who propose a buy-out of commercial fishing licences. The focus on this issue has been an unhelpful distraction, it has raised expectations about bonanzas and has not served the interests of the sector or the resource. Accordingly, I have ruled out buy-out as the way forward. However, subject to Exchequer funding I will continue to support local catchment based set-aside proposals with matching funding.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the National Salmon Commission has informed me that, following its meeting yesterday, the commission will advise me to publish draft regulations for the implementation of the new quota regime for the coming season. I have requested the chief executives of the fisheries boards and the scientific advisers, with the assistance of the BIM inshore development officers, to engage in a comprehensive round of consultations at national and regional level with the commercial fishermen. My purpose in doing so is to ensure the scientific advice is available and explained at first hand to all fishermen and to ensure that the practical arrangements for the administration of the district quotas are reasonable, workable and reflect the needs of the fishermen. Following this round of consultations and further consideration by the National Salmon Commission, and at the end of the 30 day public consultation period, I propose to sign the necessary regulations to provide for the fishery district quotas to be put into operation through the tagging scheme.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I acknowledge the fears and concerns of those in coastal communities who depend on the annual salmon run for a much needed source of income as well as for the continuation of traditions passed down the generations. I will ensure, in so far as is possible, that these fears and concerns are fairly addressed. However, the scientific evidence points to a decline in the salmon stock over recent years, which is irrefutably endorsed by emerging robust scientific data generated as a result of the work of the Marine Institute. The data and advice available to me is that, unless action is taken now, salmon stocks will slip to the point where they may be no longer capable of supporting a commercial fishery or a thriving angling sector. In the face of that advice I am sure the House will accept that doing nothing is not an option.</P>
    <P>I hope that, if we act collectively in a responsible manner to protect the salmon resource over the short term, we will enhance its availability over the medium to long term to the benefit of all who depend on it. I would urge all to support this first step in a new direction, based on the science and socio-economic needs of the commercial sector, aimed at giving salmon the fighting chance it deserves.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. When will Members be given copies of the salmon commission's recommendations? What criteria were used to set quotas? Is there a reason <Col N="124" /> the quotas announced by the Minister and reported in newspapers are substantially greater in the west than in the east and south east? On what basis did the salmon commission make its recommendations on quotas? How will the Minister implement them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not reached a conclusion in respect of the quotas. There have been ongoing discussions with the fisheries boards and the salmon fishermen. The salmon commission has considered submissions and made recommendations but I have not made a final decision on what the quotas should be. We have agreed what the tax reduction should be. It is not correct to say that the quotas in the west are greater than in other areas. There are four districts with a need for greater quota reductions &ndash; Ballyshannon, Bangor, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House the final decision on the quotas and how they will be achieved and implemented?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Sheehan pointed out, many salmon fishermen are not happy with the proposals but we are trying to reach a balance between the scientific and management advice to ensure there are cuts in the number of commercial salmon being taken while recognising the socio-economic impact of those cuts on small salmon fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister publish the scientific data upon which the Salmon Commission based its recommendations and the data available to the Marine Institute? I raised this issue last week during the debate on the Estimates. Did the Minister have an opportunity to decide how he will approach this issue? Will he set out in detail the reasons he has refused to accept a buy-out scheme? He referred to raising false expectations. We are aware that suggestions were discussed by a person who did not have a ministerial mandate. Will the Minister indicate why, when there is such a strong view in other countries on the success of buy-out schemes, he has so strongly set his face against them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the scientific figures available. We decided not to proceed with a buy-out scheme for two reasons. The only salmon fishermen interested in selling their licences were those who were catching the least amount of salmon. As a salmon conservation measure, a buy-out would not have any major impact other than costing a significant amount of money. The expectation of the serious salmon fishermen was that they should receive a much higher price for their licences than we would be prepared to consider. With scarce State resources, it is not a good investment to get into the business of buying out licences. Also, it is wrong to say that international experience of the licence buy-out is positive. The Canadian Government bought out all drift net <Col N="125" /> licences five years ago but scientific evidence has not indicated an increase in salmon going up the rivers in Canada. Apart from one or two lobbyists, no one suggests a complete buy-out will have an impact on salmon stocks. From the advice available to me, I am satisfied the approach being taken now is the most effective, whereby we reduce the level of salmon being taken commercially and by angling, and allow a greater spawning escapement so the potential of the spawning rivers can be increased and the stock re-grown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Salmon fishermen in the south east tell me they have not ever seen such a run of salmon upstream in the autumn as has been the case in the past two seasons but now they will not be allowed to catch any. It is common sense to introduce a set aside scheme, a buy-out as Deputy Dukes refers to it. In agriculture, set aside was brought in because of over production. Now the salmon catch is being curtailed to such an extent that it should be introduced because fishermen cannot make a living. It is in the interests of common justice to introduce a set aside scheme to leave those people some income &ndash; they have none under the scheme the Minister has detailed today because it is too limited. Has the Minister asked the European Commission if it would fund a set aside scheme for salmon fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The one common denominator since I became Minister is that I have yet to meet a group of fishermen who did not tell me that there were more fish than they had ever seen before in all sectors. I am not surprised Deputy Deasy has been told that they have not ever seen so many salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. We know white fish numbers are depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Scientific advice says otherwise. Salmon stocks are in serious difficulty. There will not be drastic cuts. Once we agree the total annual catch, because there has been under-reporting over the years, the range of cuts will be from a cap in some areas to a maximum of 15%. That is not a severe cut.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>It is the first time a serious attempt has been made to conserve and manage wild salmon and the Deputy should support this initiative rather than taking pot shots at it.</P>
      <P>There is a difference between buy-out and set aside and we are happy to encourage and finance set aside. Set aside means the nets would not be used for one, two or three years, whereas a buy-out involves the total buying out of the licence. I am trying to encourage set aside where local net men, anglers and fishery owners reach agreement, as they have successfully done in some of the Munster rivers. I am prepared to fund 50% of the set aside up to certain limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The High Court action in question was initiated in 1999 by the owners of the Waddington estate, whose lands adjoin the Boyne Estuary in Drogheda. The estate claimed ownership of foreshore abutting its lands which had been developed by the Drogheda Port Company <Col N="127" /> at Tom Roe's Point in the Boyne Estuary under leases granted under the Foreshore Acts, as well as infringement of riparian rights.</P>
      <P>Following advice from the Attorney General and after full consideration of the implications for the State's interest in the foreshore and Drogheda Port Company, my Department pursued and secured settlement of the action. The settlement, while recognising the property rights of the Waddington estate, safeguarded the current facility at Tom Roe's Point and allowed the Drogheda Port Company to proceed with its plans to develop an area west of the facility, subject to the appropriate consent under the Foreshore Acts, which has since been given by me. Moreover, the settlement removes any doubts that the foreshore in question is the property of the State.</P>
      <P>The area restricted by the settlement is a small part of the Boyne Estuary downstream of the Tom Roe's Point development. As I explained in my reply to Deputy Bell's Parliamentary Question No. 104 on 19 February 2002, the Boyne Estuary is a special protection area under EU legislation and any future development there must satisfy very stringent restrictions. Dúchas, the heritage service, which is the statutory authority with responsibility in this area, has informed my Department that it would have serious reservations about any further land reclamation downstream of the Tom Roe's Point development. The port company is aware that, apart from the settlement in the Waddington case, any further developments in the Boyne Estuary will be affected by these considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that as a former chairman of the port authority, I feel very strongly about this matter. The Minister is talking about law enacted in the time of Queen Victoria and riparian rights dating back to the mid-18th century. On what basis did the Attorney General telephone the High Court and instruct the legal representatives of the Department to settle the case in favour of riparian rights of the Waddington estate which effectively means that the Drogheda Port Company cannot develop one inch of land east of Tom Roe's Point? What consultation took place between the Department and Attorney General and what agreement, if any, was reached before the Attorney General gave the instruction by telephone on the day of the High Court hearing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly disagree. This was not the advice available to the Drogheda Port Company and the major company operating there, the Monaghan Company, which is the largest importer in the north-east region. The question is whether the port company can do any work on the land. I was unable to get a copy of the geographical area covered by the High Court ruling which was directed by the Attorney General from the Department against the wishes of the Drogheda Port Company. Will the Minister produce a copy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The settlement only relates to a small part of the Boyne Estuary of 272,441 square metres which is a special protection area. I will provide the Deputy with a copy of the area concerned. The settlement safeguards the whole of the Tom Roe's Point development to date and allows it to be completed to the west as proposed by the Drogheda Port Company.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that he breached Cabinet instructions in arranging that a memorandum to Government from his Department came from Mr. Teahon directly through the private office and on to Cabinet. It was the Taoiseach who decided money would be allocated to this without proper Cabinet procedure and it was the Taoiseach, rather than Mr. Teahon, who made all the crucial decisions on this. What the <Col N="131" /> Taoiseach is doing now is scapegoating a public servant and trying to pass the blame while walking away from the blame himself.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Cabinet meeting of Tuesday, 19 December, which took place at 11 a.m., agreed to a certain set of proposals while the decision in the memorandum brought by the Taoiseach to the Cabinet agreed to a certain set of proposals which were simultaneously being assessed, according to the recently published report, on the same day? Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the assessment panel's conclusions had been made available to him personally before he brought that memorandum to Government? Will he say whether Mr. Teahon indicated to him any of the reservations set out in this report? Did he draw his attention to them in any particular way? He presumably spoke to the Taoiseach about the memorandum since there was great pressure and urgency of time. Did he indicate at any stage to the Taoiseach that the assessment panel was still deliberating, if that was the case, had yet to deliberate or had just concluded its deliberations? If so, in the course of that discussion, which I presume he had with Mr. Teahon prior to going into Cabinet, was he made aware of any of the reservations or concerns that the assessment panel had about the decision they were making, which was made on the same day &ndash; perhaps around the same time the Cabinet was meeting?</P>

      <P>The Government today decided it would accept the recommendation that had been made by the board of Stadium Campus Ireland, that it would divide the two positions. We put it to Mr. Paddy Teahon, a person of outstanding integrity and commitment in my view and that of the Government, that because of all the controversy related to this, he should remain on the board but not continue in his position as chairperson &ndash; we would appoint an interim chairperson. In relation to Deputy Quinn's questions, none of those issues was raised by Paddy Teahon on that day. They were working to a very tight schedule, which is the reason for a lot of this. They were working to a schedule to try to get into planning by 22 or 23 December 2000 and they were endeavouring to get all the assessment panel work done. It appears from the correspondence that they had been told by PricewaterhouseCoopers that there were some difficulties at that time &ndash; they were told on that day. The papers show that on that day the issues regarding Waterworld UK had arisen. They did not make me aware of any of those issues, I suppose, for clarity, as it was also in the papers for the committee. I was responsible for bringing the memorandum to Government but Mr. Teahon attended <Col N="132" /> that Government meeting to bring the Cabinet through the particular meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can clarify that Mr. Teahon attended to answer questions on the memorandum that day which is not unusual for the Government. There were several other occasions on which people were at meetings. He attended, as is clear from the papers which have been given to the Committee of Public Accounts, and answered questions on the matter but we were not aware of the circumstances regarding Waterworld UK or the fact that it was a shelf company. That was not necessarily the issue as there could be many shelf companies &ndash; many businesspeople use shelf companies. More importantly, they did not have the financial backing or the necessary investment and they were not a company of international standing, as we thought. Neither Mr. Teahon nor CSID knew that either. It was many months later that that became clear and they then had to join with others, when the Tralee-based group was involved. They were subsequently joined by Mr. Moriarty but he was not in on that particular case.</P>

      <P>They are still there. The consortium for executive service contracts is made up <Col N="133" /> of seven different groups. That is still in place and is a matter for the board. The Office of Public Works remains as the technical advisers to the board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan asked me about Mr. Teahon's contractual arrangement as he was in payment. An understanding will have to be agreed about that because he will not continue to be paid when he is not chairman and chief executive. That position had been made clear since last May, and the HBR report has stated that there would be a split in the roles. I do not think there is any dispute.</P>
      <P>The Government and Mr. Teahon agreed it would be better if Mr. Teahon was not to remain as chairperson, in the interests of finishing the contract and having the pool ready for the Special Olympics World Games. He has worked extremely hard on the project and the fact that certain issues were not sufficiently delved into can be attributed to his desire to do the job as speedily as possible. If all procedures had been followed to the letter of the law, which is the right thing to do, we would not be in a position to complete the swimming pool in time for the Special Olympics, which would be regretted by all Deputies. Our attempt to complete the aquatic centre is the relevant issue, although people are asking many other questions in papers which are before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

Has the financial contract for the services he was rendering in that joint capacity been terminated and, if so, will he receive some form of compensation? Have the terms and the amount of the compensation been negotiated or agreed between Mr. Teahon and the Department of Finance?</P>

I refer to any details that may have emerged to help her or the Cabinet to come to a different set of conclusions.

It was not that Waterworld UK was a shelf company or that Dublin Waterworld was there, but the fact was that the company did not have the substance. The point made by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and I was that if Waterworld UK's lack of substance had been known by Mr. Teahon and others, we would have had to decide whether to pursue the contract in such circumstances. A decision to continue may or may not have been made. The point made by the Minister, Deputy McDaid, the Tánaiste and I is that the contract was not pursued when the company ran into similar difficulties in Stockport or Southport, as it was researched and problems were uncovered.</P>

The scheme, about which Deputy Quinn asked last week, is funded from the social insurance fund and operates on the basis of the redundancy payments Acts. The task of the review group is to identify the legislative, administrative and system <Col N="136" /> requirements of a more efficient, simpler and customer service driven scheme, to examine the benefits payable under the scheme, to develop options for the social partners and to report to the Minister.</P>

It is generally recognised because of the tardiness of the Government in introducing broadband we are fast losing our place in the whole e-commerce world. The Communications Regulation Bill which we asked for week in week out since Christmas and which was published three weeks ago is only at Second Stage in the Seanad. The Digital Hub Development Agency Bill which was published in January still has not been introduced in either House. What is the situation in relation to those two Bills and have we a guarantee that they will both be enacted before the Taoiseach decides to run to the Park?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is worthwhile to outline briefly the various steps in the contract process. The objective of the ten<Col N="149" /> der competition was to acquire two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
      <P>The tender competition was carried out in two stages, a request for proposals stage and a request for tenders stage. Responses to the request for proposals were received in the Department on 21 September 2000. Six responses were received. The six responses were evaluated and a short list of four companies for participation in the RFT stage was drawn up. The documentation for the request for tender stage issued on 5 March 2001 and tenders were due back in the Department on 19 April 2001. On that date tenders were received from four companies. Following receipt of tenders a comprehensive evaluation process began on the proposed helicopters. The evaluation, of necessity, took some time to complete.</P>
      <P>On 3 August 2001, a reduced price proposal was received from EH Industries. On 16 August 2001, Sikorsky submitted a revised price. On 24 September 2001, a further reduced price proposal was received from Sikorsky and this revised bid was the subject of a number of newspaper articles on 7 October 2001. On 11 October 2001, Ambassador Egan made a courtesy call to me. Our discussions centred mainly on the 11 September atrocities and during the course of the meeting, the ambassador asked me to give consideration to Sikorsky's revised proposal of 24 September 2001. He followed this up in his letter of 24 October 2001. The House will be aware of the statement of 24 March by the US Embassy on this matter.</P>
      <P>As the validity of all tenders had expired by 30 September 2001 and taking account of the changed international situation, I decided to seek best and final prices from each of the four tenderers which were to be submitted by 13 December 2001.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what I have said about the sequence of events that the ambassador did not present me with a new bid on behalf of Sikorsky. The US ambassador is no more an agent of any American company than are the ambassadors of Italy and the United Kingdom of EH Industries or the ambassador of France of Eurocopter. All four quite properly extolled the merits of their national industries. It is no more or no less than I would expect of them or of an Irish ambassador representing the interests of this country.</P>
      <P>Let me be very clear. The ambassador of the United States had no authority and did not seek to make a revised bid on behalf of Sikorsky. I had no authority and did not seek to accept any such bid. In fact, the letter the ambassador sent to me on 24 October 2001 was not even acknowledged as was the case with the voluminous oral and written representations I received from many quarters, including all sides of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any suggestion that I acted outside the strict conditions of the tender process is outrageous <Col N="150" /> and I will forcefully communicate this to the editor of the<i> Sunday Independent.</i>The only bids considered were those of April 2001 and the best and final offers received on 13 December 2001. All contenders were given the exact same opportunity to review their prices in the light of the changed circumstances. All were treated equally. Three of the four submitted revised lower quotations.</P>
    <P>I made my decision in the interests of the taxpayer and strictly in accordance with the competition criteria. I stand foursquare behind that decision. There was no underhand dealing. There was no back room collusion. This is the right decision for the country and the Air Corps.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Shatter's implication that Sikorsky was aware from some source that its tender was not the most competitive, I have no information on this except that I am aware that the company has denied any such knowledge.</P>
    <P>While I cannot predict the outcome of court proceedings, it is my intention to proceed with the contract at the earliest possible date to ensure that the Air Corps has the best available recourses to carry out its maritime search and rescue role which is so important to the seafaring community which uses Irish waters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proposed purchase of Sikorsky helicopters is in the best interests of this country, will the Minister explain why we are purchasing helicopters that have been rejected by Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Canada and Portugal? What criteria has the Minister used to determine that this country should, effectively, be the guinea pig for these helicopters which have been rejected by a number of our European partners? Does the Minister agree it is essential that confidentiality is preserved in the tendering process?</P>
      <P>I refer to the circumstance in which the American ambassador could have known that the new Sikorsky bid in September 2001 appeared quite advantageous in cost terms to other bids &ndash; as if the American ambassador and the Sikorsky company were aware of the other bids. Does the Minister agree that no such comment could have been contained in the American ambassador's letter to him had the ambassador not have been aware of the other bids? Does he agree that no one outside the Department of Defence and the review group assessing the bids should have had any knowledge of the bids received by the Minister?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it was quite irregular for him to engage in discussions with the American ambassador specifically about the different tenders received? Does he agree that is the only conclusion that can be drawn from the letter of 24 October 2001 received by him from the American ambassador in which he states his appreciation for the Minister's personal attention in this complex matter?</P>

Marks were awarded under eight headings related directly to the award criteria &ndash; operational capability, operational suitability, technical merit, ease of maintenance, product support and warranties, training, life cycle costs over 20 years and tender prices. EH Industries was the top scorer under heading number one, Sikorsky was top scorer under headings numbers <Col N="152" /> two, three and four, Eurocopter was top scorer under number five, EH Industries was top scorer under number six and Sikorsky was top scorer under number seven and eight.

In the report, the Minister seems to indicate that following the 11 September atrocities, he went about trying to save the taxpayer money and entered into re-negotiations or sought revised tenders. Is it fair to say that his decision was made for him by EH Industries and Sikorsky which both submitted reduced offers on 3 and 16 August, respectively, that that was the reason he went back to seek revised tenders to save the taxpayer money and not because of 11 September and that it was not initiated by him? Did the Italian, British or French ambassadors make representations to him? If they did, what form did those representations take? He briefly referred to them extolling the virtues of their national industries. Did they make any direct request to him to consider companies from their countries? When does the Minister expect the delivery of these helicopters? If Sikorsky gets the contract when does it expect to <Col N="153" /> deliver them? Has the Minister an indication of when the industry expects they will be delivered?</P>
      <P>Reports have appeared about readvertising for tenders. I do not necessarily believe those reports but can the Minister put the issue to bed? The Minister mentioned that he did not acknowledge the letter from the ambassador of the United States of America sent on 24 October. Does he agree that as a common courtesy he should acknowledge all letters he receives from ambassadors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor did I acknowledge the representations made by Deputy Noonan when he asked me, through the Taoiseach, to take a different route. I did not acknowledge representations from anybody. There were more representations on this contract than anybody could possibly envisage. Representations came from all sides of this House. I ignored all representations. The decision I took was in strict accordance with EU regulations. Every aspect of it was covered. It was a fair, free and open process.</P>
      <P>I have outlined why the second tender was sought. Tender prices expire on a certain date, on 30 September in this instance. I sought final tenders on 13 December. Arising from my judgment on that and the successful tender process, I saved the taxpayer about &euro;5 million on the total contract. My judgment and justification in doing what I did was vindicated. Fine Gael asked me to consider having another tendering process.</P>
      <P>The expectation is that we will secure the helicopters around the end of 2003. I intend to continue negotiations with Sikorsky to complete the contract as soon as I can. Obviously it is subject to a judicial review and I must await the outcome of that process. I received representations from ambassadors on behalf of every company.</P>

      <P>I am pleased this is being discussed in the House and that the Minister is here to clear up the matter. Like everyone else I want to see this matter resolved so that we can receive the helicopters. The Minister stated that he received representations from other ambassadors. Did he meet other ambassadors?</P>

      <P>Did he meet military attachés from the United States and other countries? When the Minister received the representation from the American ambassador, did he tell him that he passed the issues raised to the appropriate expert group? There are contradictory statements in the newspapers from the PR people from the different groups. Is the Minister concerned that there were leaks in the tender process? It put into the public arena information showing one company's bid was higher than another. Did the Minister seek to clear up that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rightly said that representations were made by all parties in this House on this issue. I am well aware that members of my party <Col N="154" /> made representations. They wanted the issue to be resolved and have the process moved on to contract stage. Now is the time to clear this up once and for all. If one was to read the newspapers one would believe that there was only one side to the story and that the American ambassador was the only ambassador involved. Were other ambassadors or military attachés involved? Did the Minister examine the leaks that led to successive tenders from different parties?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I met other ambassadors and in almost all cases their military attachés. I did not pass on to the expert group any of the representations made to me. I did not take those representations into account, nor did I take into account those of the Deputy. On 18 October Deputy Wall raised the issue in the House. He said:</P>
      <P>One company in the tendering process sought an extension of the closing date. During that period the company submitted a new bid which was 27% less than the original bid and the Department of Defence now refuses to accept this second bid. Considering the financial implications for the Department and the overall cost of this project, why will the Department of Defence not recognise the second offer from one of the participants, given that it was within the tender period?</P>
      <P>That gives an idea of the representations that were made at the time. I could not consider that. My answer was that I was adhering to the tender process and the EU regulations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wall's party leader said on 21 November:</P>
      <P>Before I was interrupted, I was asking the Taoiseach if he will intervene to prevent the loss of 150 jobs and the departure of some business that we could retain here . . . Does the Taoiseach agree with recent reports in the newspapers that counter trading is common practice in defence procurement? A recent newspaper report cited at least six European states, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Norway, in which the Governments have been engaged in this practice. While there is a precedent for it, I respect the Taoiseach's comments on transparency and tenders. We should have transparency.</P>

    <P>I ask him to repeat the entire process and invite offsets along the lines described to ensure we get the best deal in terms of the equipment the Air Corps needs and the best offset for securing jobs in FLS, formerly TEAM Aer Lingus.

I would be pleased to contemplate implementing again the <Col N="155" /> whole process, including offsets, to make sure there will not be accusations of favouritism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first three questions is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The answer to the final question is that the Taoiseach and I had discussions at different times on various matters, including this. It was in the public arena and the Taoiseach was being pressed by Deputies on all sides to intervene in the tendering process, which he rejected. I was in the House on those occasions.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy on all these counts, particularly on the questions about the ambassador telephoning me and in relation to any other company, that the answer is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I emphasise, in case he has any doubt, that the representations that were made in relation to this tendering process were probably unique. I am happy that I withstood the pressure that I was put under from a variety of quarters, the heaviest of which was in this House by the leaders of the Labour Party and Fine Gael, so as to protect the State and the taxpayer and to ensure that the Air Corps got the best possible deal. There was no other consideration for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, to put it at its mildest, he was extremely unwise to engage in discussions with the American ambassador or any other ambassador about the tendering process and the tenders received? Will he acknowledge and accept that European Union regulations expect the confidentiality of the process to be protected and that an objective decision will be made on the tenders received? Will he confirm that Mr. Michael Keane, a public relations consultant and former general secretary of the Progressive Democrats, and Paddy Duffy, <Col N="156" /> a former special adviser to the Taoiseach, lobbied on behalf of Sikorsky?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as the leader of Fine Gael made representations on behalf of Sikorsky, so too did many other people. The best reply is that given by the Taoiseach on 21 November in the Dáil that virtually every Member of the House had lobbied for one or other of the companies involved. Deputy Shatter suggests that he was, or is aware of the conversation I had with Mr. Egan, the ambassador, but he does not have the facts. He is prepared to put out in an insidious way something that he knows in his heart and soul to be untrue. I never discussed the tendering process with Mr. Egan or anyone else.</P>
      <P>I have been in this House a long time, I have been a Minister in a number of Departments and I have decided tendering on a range of products, both national and international, and I tell my colleagues in the House that I have never deviated from the truth. The Deputy can attempt innuendo as much as he wants but the truth will win out in the finish, and I am happy to be able to say that about this and all other contracts. I did not discuss the tendering process with any ambassador.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, on Tipperary FM yesterday, accused me of incompetence. I could be inclined to return the compliment, but will be more generous. In the business of politics, people have approached me all my life to say certain things. They are free to say what they want to me. If the ambassador of America, or any other country, pays me a courtesy visit &ndash; that one was mainly concerned with the atrocities of 11 September &ndash; and mentions another matter to me such as the tender, am I supposed to lock that out of the conversation? My position is simple and it is that I do not discuss things but people are free to say or write to me what they want. It is extraordinary that someone, who pretends in this House to defend people's rights, wants to suffocate any person visiting a Minister so that he or she is not free to speak. Is that the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful to the whole process if we had more frankness and the simple truth. Last year, strong representations were made in this House to make me yield and do <Col N="157" /> something that I should not do under EU regulations, and I rejected them. I took my own course and from that secured a bid which would save the taxpayer, over the whole process, about &euro;5 million. The technical merits and other aspects of the successful tender are not in doubt. I wish to proceed and am not the one standing in the way, although people in this House, with a different motivation, are. I would like people to accept reality and allow the process to continue.</P>
      <P>If court proceedings have to be fought, I am confident, on the basis of the exactitude with which we approached this matter, that we will be able to proceed on the basis that I outlined as quickly as possible. We have been waiting a long time for these helicopters and the Air Corps wants them. I know that an election is coming and that opportunism is part and parcel of what we must live with, but the facts are supreme and the truth is the truth. I only want the freedom to pursue this and move on, and I ask Deputies to let that happen so that we can secure for the Air Corps what it has waited for a long time. However, I cannot put an exact time on it.</P>

The Deputies will appreciate that winning the tender does not place obligations on anyone until the contract is signed, which I want to do as soon as possible. I cannot give a precise time.</P>
      <P>We worked on the basis of a great deal of co-operation over the past four or five years and it would be helpful if the Deputy took into account the difference between the stance particular parties took on this issue last October and that now.

      <P>I know the Deputy is not trying to catch me out but this is the first time he has turned turtle on me. First, I explained time and again that there is no scope for considering offset arrangements under European Union regulations. Second, it would be incomprehensibly difficult to evaluate the merits or otherwise of offsets but once a contract is signed with a particular company, it is important at that stage to do the best one can on the offset. However, it cannot be done at the tender stage. The Deputy should bear in mind that EU regulations are clear on this issue, there is no scope whatsoever for offset arrangements. They may be engaged in when a contract is being signed and it would be up to Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland to pursue that matter.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;(1)&nbsp;(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;The Government may by order transfer to the Minister a function or functions of the Board where, in the opinion of the Government, there is an emergency or apprehended emergency that involves a serious risk to persons or property of such a nature or magnitude that it is necessary and expedient that the function be performed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) The Government may by order amend or revoke an order under this subsection (including an order under this paragraph).</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) If a provision of an order under this subsection that transfers a function is revoked, the function shall thereupon become and be vested in the Board.</P>

This provision would only be exercised with the full authority of the Government. This amendment provides for that contingency. The Deputies will recall that I indicated on Committee Stage that this proposal was necessary to allow the Government of the day to withdraw the powers of the board and to take them over in the case of an emergency.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" />&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) an officer of the Minister appointed in that behalf by the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The argument I make is for the inclusion of a nominee of the General Council of County Councils on the Civil Service board. I have had numerous representations on this matter. As they have a certain status in local government, councillors are of the view that they should have representation on relevant boards such as the Civil Defence board. We agreed on Committee Stage that the report would be produced every three years rather than every five years. I supported the view that a report should be produced every five years because there would be too much pressure on a local authority to produce one every three years, but the Minister of State, in his wisdom, decided on three years having made a case in that regard.</P>
    <P>That puts more emphasis on including a member of the General Council of County Councils on what will be the Civil Defence board because what is expected of the board and in terms of the reports will relate back through the system to the local authorities. Thanks to the general secretary and the board of the General Council of County Councils, local authorities are well organised in terms of getting information to councillors and this is an ideal opportunity for the Minister to acknowledge that. The Minister would be giving positions to people who want them. They want to be involved in the mechanism of better local government and the three yearly Civil Defence report will be part of that improvement in terms of Civil Defence involvement in local authorities.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept a nominee from the General Council of County Councils, even among one of the four ministerial appointees, because they can bring their expertise to the board together with the Garda and Defence Forces representatives and perhaps give an opposite view to that of the county managers association. We would then have a full brief in terms of Civil Defence matters and the full involvement of the local authorities through the representative of the general council. I hope the Minister will consider that favourably because the relevance of such a proposal cannot be over-emphasised. The other amendments are fairly technical. There is nothing of consequence in them so I appeal to the Minister to consider one of the appointees to be a nominee of the General Council of County Councils because of the way it has organised its conferences and the way it relates to every local authority throughout the country. It is to be congratulated on that and if it does not get this position it will be a rebuff to the council in terms of all the work it has done to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward some of these amendments which are in line with issues raised by Deputy Wall and me on Committee Stage. We both referred to the desire to have a member of the Defence Forces on the board for expertise and linkage purposes. The Minister pointed out that <Col N="161" /> the position is similar in the case of the Garda Síochána. The amendment is welcome. I hate harking back to Roscrea, but I want to confirm whether Roscrea will be the headquarters of the board? Deputy Wall's point that one of the board members should be a representative of the General Council of County Councils is the main bone of contention. It is provided that one representative will be nominated by the County and City Managers Association. The idea behind the devolution of power to ensure better local government and the concept of directly elected mayors is to give power back to the elected members of local authorities. In many respects, the work of a local authority impacts to a much greater extent than the work of central Government on an individual in his or her day to day life, yet elected representatives have little or no power. Often they are there almost as a sufferance to management in the council. That will change in the future. It would be desirable if a member of the General Council of County Councils were represented on the board. I would like to hear the Minister of State's view on that. Amendment No. 19<i>a </i>provides for the deletion of lines 34 and 35 on page 14, which refer to disqualifying a member of a local authority from being on the board. Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on that proposal, if that is in order &ndash; there may be some light at the end of the tunnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the Deputy's last point first. We will remove that prohibition so that a member of a local authority can be a member of the board. I do not disagree with the principle of the desirability of having local public representatives on a board such as this. Our difficulty is that it is already provided that the board will have 14 members. Apart from the director general, there will be a nomination to the board from the County and City Managers Association, a person nominated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government with expertise in emergency planning, a nominee of the Radiological Protection Institute, a person nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency, a member of the Civil Defence officers, a volunteer member of the Civil Defence and a member of the staff of the board. In response to points made by Deputies Timmins and Wall, I have added two more members to the board, a nominee of the Garda Commissioner and a nominee of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. I take the point that if the Civil Defence has to deal with emergencies, those two authorities should be represented on the board.</P>
      <P>I think I have met the Deputies' requests more than half way to the extent of removing the prohibition against a councillor being on the board. This is appropriate and I am glad the Deputies brought that to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Wall's point, the Minister of the day will appoint four nominees to the board and it would be appropriate that one of those nominees would be a nominee of the Gen<Col N="162" /> eral Council of County Councils. I do not have a problem with that proposal. We will seriously consider doing that in regard to the first board. That is the right way to proceed.</P>
    <P>To the extent that there is a political dotted line, rather than the nominee bodies, the political dotted line will come from the Minister of the day in the form of his or her four nominees. If one of those four is a nomination from the General Council of County Councils, there is an appropriateness about that proposal.</P>
    <P>I have met the Deputies' requirements in two ways, by removing the prohibition against a member of a local authority being a member of the board and indicating my personal support that one of the Minister's four nominations should be a nominee from the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 proposes that the Minister's four nominees to the board should be reduced to three. For obvious reasons it is better to leave that number at four because it will allow for more members.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 deals with Deputy Wall's proposal that one of the members of the board should be a nominee of the General Council of County Councils, to which I responded. Amendment No. 5 is a typographical one. Amendment No. 6 is in my name. Amendment No. 7 in Deputy Timmins's name proposes the inclusion on the board of additional members. I indicated that a member of the Garda Síochána and a member of the Defence Forces will be appointed to the board.</P>

As he has given a clear indication that the Minister of the day will appoint a nominee of the General Council of County Councils to the first board, as permitted under section 10(<i>c</i>) &ndash; I hope it will be a case of once one gets a foot in the door it is hard to put one out &ndash; I will be happy to withdraw amendments Nos. 3, 4 &ndash; although it is also in Deputy Wall's name &ndash; and 7.</P>

I appreciate what he said and thank him for what he has agreed to do.

      <P>In page 11 to delete lines 25 to 27 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) In making appointments to the Board under this section, the Minister shall ensure that not less than 4 of the members of the Board shall be women and not less than 4 shall be men.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, I have taken further advice on this matter. I consider this amendment will adequately allow for appropriate gender balance on the board, as requested by Deputies McGennis and Wall during the Committee Stage debate. The amendment will ensure that at least four members of each gender will be included on all future Civil Defence boards, even where only a minimum of eight members are appointed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 in Deputy Wall's name proposes a different formula to achieve the same objective. Rather than provide for a percentage, my legal advice is that it is better to proceed this way, to lay down in law that at least four members will be women and four members will be men. That will allow the other six members of the board to be dealt with as the need arises. I expect the nominating bodies to play their part in this. As has happened previously in respect of a number of Bills, such bodies have left that matter to the Minister of the day and have not taken account of it. I expect future Ministers to ensure that the list of bodies that will make nominations to the board will take account of the gender balance requirement. This is a good formula and is not far removed from what Deputy Wall wants. My advice is that this is a better way to do it from a legal point of view.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says. I am pleased to note that we have made the change as it is important that we take account of gender balance in any legislation under which such boards exist. When this issue arises I hope the Minister of the day will inform members of the nominating body that it is expected that the gender balance of the nominees will reflect that of the board. I have no problem withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 8 which deals with gender balance and takes into consideration Deputy Wall's amendment. Can the Minister clarify one point? Each independent body has a right to nominate anybody it likes whether male or female. Is it the case, therefore, that the only power the Minister will have is to refuse a nomination? If a body decides to nominate Mr. X and the Minister is seeking a woman he can refuse to accept the nomination. Is that the only thing he can do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the case. The section states that the board should consist of at least eight members but not more than 14, who shall be appointed by the Minister. All of the nominating bodies, such as the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will send the names of nominees to the Minister who could, under the legislation, refuse to make the appointment. I presume the Minister will be required to agree with the nomination. There is no time limit but the Minister will ultimately be required to agree with the nomination under the Act. A Minister could, in the first instance, refuse on the basis that no attempt was made to reflect gender balance and I expect that the Minister of the day would prevail in that argument by not making the appointment until he is satisfied that the requirement was met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it is probably too late for this, would it be possible to have something written into the legislation to provide for the rotation of bodies which produce nominees? Maybe that would be too prescriptive. I am not sure whether that could be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably is too prescriptive and it would become very cumbersome. We are putting into law the requirement for a minimum of four men and four women. I expect, and I will insist with regard to the first authority, that the issue of gender balance be taken seriously by the nominating body and I expect future Ministers to do exactly the same. There are a number of precedents for this. I recall from my time as Minister for Education that on a number of occasions I had to return nominations from bodies because they had not taken account of requirements such as this. Once I had taken that action there was no difficulty. The bodies reconsidered the nominations and they were mostly accommodating. In this day and age a heavy hand should not be <Col N="165" /> applied. I am happy that the Minister of the day will have the authority to insist on a proper gender balance in the nominations and that it will not be left to the Minister. Whether it is acted upon by the nominating bodies or by the Minister, four and four is a good formula.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 24 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&ndash;(1) There shall be a chief executive officer of the Board who shall be known and is referred to in this Act as the &lsquo;director general'.</P>
      <P>(2) The first director general shall be a civil servant appointed by the Minister and shall, upon such appointment, be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State.</P>
      <P>(3) Each subsequent director general shall be appointed by the Minister, with the agreement of the Board, on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commissioners and shall, upon such appointment, be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to do with the chief executive officer of the board. I indicated on Committee Stage that I had given much thought to the appointment of the first and subsequent directors general of the board. I am satisfied this amendment provides a mechanism for the smooth and efficient establishment of the Civil Defence Board and its administration. It also provides for flexibility in the management of the board in the future. The amendment is very carefully crafted, especially section 13(3). I have had extensive discussions with my officials about this. I am proposing that the first director general will be a civil servant. That is important for continuity. Due to the fact that Civil Defence is in the business of dealing with emergencies it is also important that the director general has the kind of State authority a civil servant would have. The director of Civil Defence has been a civil servant for many years and that has been very useful due to the direct connection with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thereafter, directors general are to be appointed with the agreement of the board. Any <Col N="166" /> competition is to be organised by the Civil Service Commission which will then recommend a person. However, once a person, who may come from outside the Civil Service, is selected he or she will become a civil servant. We arrived at this formula after much discussion. I accepted the view that it would be useful if non-civil servants were able to apply for the post down the line. Somebody who worked in a similar organisation in Canada or the USA, for example, might be available to take up such a post and his or her experience could be useful. However, that person would then be appointed to the Civil Service of the State because from the point of view of links and the possibility of emergencies it is desirable that the person at the centre of the organisation has the authority necessary for dealing with the Garda, the Army, the Minister and various bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister flagged this amendment on Second Stage and mentioned it on Committee Stage. I would have had some concerns if it had been intended that the competition be confined to a certain group for ever. There is merit in what the Minister said. In the current climate and in the interest of getting the post established it is perhaps better on this occasion that a member of the permanent Civil Service be appointed to the position of director general. It is also desirable that people from outside the Civil Service be able to apply for the position subsequently, even though somebody else from the Civil Service may eventually be appointed and do a better job. I am happy not to move amendment No. 12.</P>

      <P>The Minister has obviously put much thought into this amendment because there was a great deal of discussion about it on Committee Stage. I received a letter on the subject from a Civil Defence officer, from which I will read the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>The current system of the Civil Defence Branch of the Department of Defence and interaction with Local Authorities and Civil Defence Officers has worked well, however it may be seen in a different light under a new structure with a Board and a Chief Executive Officer/Director General. Will Civil Defence Officers be able to apply for the position of C.E.O/Director General? Will local Civil Defence Officers have to report to two masters? What will be the length of service of the Board?</P>
      <P>Obviously, Civil Defence officers will not be able to apply for the post in the initial stages but will subsequently be in a position to do so. I support the Minister's amendment which addresses the queries raised by my party on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="171" />In page 7, line 14, after &ldquo;1973,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;THE LAW REFORM COMMISSION ACT, 1975,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage there was an extensive discussion about a proposal, which would have repealed a provision in the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, whereby service as a barrister appointed as a whole time commissioner or officer of the Law Reform Commission is deemed to be practice at the bar for the purpose of qualification for appointment as a judge. In the case of solicitors, the equivalent provision allows for such service to be deemed to be practice for appointment as a District Court judge. I gave careful consideration to the arguments advanced as to why this provision should not be repealed. On reflection, I accept it might act as a disincentive in terms of the future recruitment of individuals of appropriate calibre and expertise to the commission. In consequence, therefore, I have decided to introduce the changes which are largely contained in amendment No. 10, to which this amendment is related.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 24, after &ldquo;MATTERS,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;TO PROVIDE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A REGISTER TO BE KNOWN AS THE REGISTER OF RESERVED JUDGMENTS,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that I hoped to be in a position to bring forward a Report Stage amendment which would provide for the establishment of a register of reserved judgments. I also indicated that such a provision had the potential to introduce a measure of accountability into this area. The amendment provides for the establishment of such a register. The intention is that its establishment and maintenance will be a function of the Courts Service and that it will be accessible to members of the public. A variety of administrative arrangements will have to be put in train before the register is up and running. For that reason, much of the operational detail which will attach to its establishment will be prescribed by ministerial order. This will facilitate the widest consultation with those who will be called upon to give day to day effect to this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is essentially envisaged as a monitoring provision. It is of importance that there be no unreasonable delay in the delivery of court <Col N="172" /> judgments. Litigants have a right to expect that judgment in their cases will be delivered within a reasonable timeframe and I hope the existence of a register of reserved judgments will help to secure the realisation of that legitimate expectation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide for commencement provisions in respect of three specified sections. Section 21 will enable increased powers to be devolved to county registrars. Section 28 concerns the enhanced pension arrangements for Mr. Justice Frederick Morris and section 45 deals with the register of reserved judgments, the establishment of which is the subject of another amendment which I will move later. In all three cases, it is appropriate that some measure of discretion be provided in relation to the coming into operation of the provisions.</P>

    <P>On Committee Stage, persuasive arguments were made about extending eligibility for appointment to the superior courts to Irish judges who might in future serve on certain other international courts and tribunals, aside from those already specified in section 4. There were certain technical difficulties inherent in the amendments tabled <Col N="174" /> by Opposition Members, which made it impossible to accept them in the form in which they were drafted. However, an undertaking was given to consider the matter further with a view to tabling an appropriate amendment on Report Stage. The amendment honours that undertaking. The amendment to section 9 is consequential on the adjustments I propose in respect of section 4.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 27, to delete &ldquo;2&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;4&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This issue is important. Existing law provides for the appointment of a judge of the Circuit Court to the High Court after four years service. The Minister proposes to reduce the four year requirement to two. Four years is a reasonable period for a judge to experience the operation of the Circuit Court before he or she moves to the superior courts. Otherwise, there could be quick promotions for different branches of the judicial profession and people could move quickly from the District Court to the High Court, which might not be in the best interest of the scrutiny of judges before their appointment. It is a matter of subjective judgment but I am much happier with the four year provision rather than the Minister's proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, the Deputy proposes that a barrister or solicitor should be eligible for appointment to the Supreme or High Court after 12 years practice while a person who is already a judge would not be so eligible until he or she had aggregated at least 14 years as a practitioner and a judge. Implementation of this proposal would result in inequitable treatment and is not something I could stand over. I am satisfied the approach taken in the legislation, whereby Circuit Court judges who have served as such for not less than two years, are eligible for appointment as a judge of the superior courts, is a reasonable one and there are no proposals to revert to the existing statutory provisions.</P>

I am defending the <i>status quo</i>, which has been argued for by Ministers in the past and agreed by the Oireachtas. However, if the Minister is minded to make this change, for whatever reason, I will not argue further about it.</P>

      <P Just="Center">Judicial Conduct</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.&ndash;(1) Every judge shall uphold at all times the standards set out in this Act and in any code of conduct which may be adopted in accordance with law applying to judicial <Col N="176" /> conduct, the dignity and high standing of the office of judge and his or her own standing as a holder of that office.</P>
    <P>(2) It is the duty of every judge &ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) to comply with the provisions of this Act and of any code of conduct which may be adopted in accordance with law applying to judicial conduct,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) not to engage in conduct (whether in the exercise of the office of judge or otherwise) which is dishonest or which may otherwise bring the office of judge into disrepute or which is prejudicial to the administration of justice, and</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) to observe the ethics and etiquette of his or her office.</P>
    <P>(3) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (2)</i>, a judge shall &ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) act with total impartiality in relation to all persons and matters and shall refrain from treating, or from taking any step or making any comment which could give rise to him or her being seen to treat, any party, witness or lawyer with affection or ill-will,</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) ensure that all persons appearing before him or her are given a full opportunity to be heard consistent with rules of court,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) refrain from any unnecessary criticisms of persons (whether parties, witnesses or lawyers) appearing before him or her, or from any comment, opinion or innuendo extraneous to his or her judicial functions,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) act with the utmost courtesy and respect to all persons appearing before him or her, whether parties, witnesses and lawyers, and</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) be and be seen to be conscious of his or her role as a public servant.</P>
    <P>(4) A judge who holds office on the 31st day of December in any year shall, not later than the 1st day of February in the following year, prepare and furnish to both Houses of the Oireachtas a statement in writing (which shall be made available to the public) in such form as may be determined by resolution approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas or in a form to the like effect of his or her interests (within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995) and additional interests (within the meaning of section 13 of the said Act) during that year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" />(5) A judge shall not perform a function of his or her office where he or she or a connected person (within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995) has a material interest in a matter to which the function relates.</P>
    <P>(6) A judge may not accept or retain a gift in circumstances corresponding to circumstances in which an office holder would be precluded from accepting or retaining a gift pursuant to section 15 of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We did not have a substantial debate about this amendment on Committee Stage. It would be difficult for a Member to take great exception to its content.</P>
    <P>It mirrors in the judicial system the code of conduct we have applied to ourselves. I gleaned some of the phraseology from my service as a member of the Committee on Members' Interests. It is appropriate that there should be a code of conduct for judges, that there should be a legal requirement to act in the manner which I have outlined in a very detailed amendment and that it should be enforced. Amendment No. 11 sets out the requirements for a code of judicial conduct and the essential conduct that would be appropriate for a judge. No one would object to a requirement for judges to refrain from unnecessary criticism of those appearing before them or from any comment, opinion or innuendo extraneous to their judicial functions. We have seen cases in the past where extraneous comments were made and that does not lend dignity or add public support to the judicial system, upon which our democracy is based.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 proposes to enforce the new section with breaches being deemed misconduct so action could be taken. Amendment No. 13 sets out some definitions. The Minister was of the view that this is not an appropriate vehicle for recommendations on judicial conduct whatever their merits. In responding on Report State, I hope the Minister will indicate that, whatever the outcome of the election, he will support the early enactment of judicial conduct legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a general matter the Deputy raised on Committee Stage. Even he will acknowledge that the Bill does not provide the correct context for the provisions he proposes. He will also acknowledge that the amendments before us represent only part of the judicial oversight system he had in mind because some of the provisions he earlier sought to have included in the Bill were ruled out of order. These included the establishment of a judicial ethics tribunal to inquire into complaints about alleged misconduct by judges. Leaving aside any other misgivings I have about the Deputy's proposals, it would be totally ineffective to propose ethical standards without an enforcement system. A judicial coun<Col N="178" /> cil or ethics body of some kind is needed for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Judicial conduct and ethics have been considered in the recent past by the constitutional review group and by the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution which,<i> inter alia</i>, recognised the need for improved oversight of judicial conduct and, in the case of the all-party committee, recommended the establishment of a judicial council to review judicial conduct. More recently, a report from a judicial committee established by the Chief Justice also recommended the establishment of a judicial ethics and oversight body. I framed proposals to act immediately in this area by proposing a constitutional amendment to be followed by legislation to establish a judicial council and ethics committee. Regrettably the Government felt compelled to withdraw the proposals because of the failure of the main Opposition parties to support them.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the attitude of the Opposition led to the withdrawal of these proposals, thereby depriving the judicial system and the public of a new, open and accountable system for investigating complaints and a clear and fair procedure for removing a judge from office should that become necessary at any time in the future. I remain convinced, however, of the need for action in this area, particularly for a judicial ethics and oversight body. In that respect, preliminary work on legislative proposals has continued in my Department.</P>

      <P>There was some díospóireacht on Committee Stage on this matter and I was disappointed at the Minister's attitude. He was pressed for time but the essence of his response was that individuals in Gaeltacht areas had access to judges with ability in the Irish language. That runs counter to the point I was trying to make &ndash; a consensus point in this House and certainly one notionally advanced by the Government &ndash; that all citizens of this country have the right to do their business through the Irish language, trí Ghaeilge más mian. It is not a right that falls simply to citizens who happen to reside in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>The majority of Irish speakers live in the Gaeltacht. In Dublin a huge number of people use Irish as a means of communication and send their children to scoileanna lánGhaelacha. The Gaelscoil movement is raising a new generation of citizens with an even greater facility in the Irish language than their parents. Therefore, it is reasonable to include ability in the Irish language. The amendment was suggested by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, a group that would have the respect of the House. I hope the Minister will demonstrate his south Kerry and Fianna Fáil credentials in defence of an teanga Gaelainn and accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This proposal was discussed at some length on Committee Stage and I cannot accept it. I indicated previously that bilingualism is not a requirement for judicial appointment. Sections 44 and 71 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, state that circuit and district judges assigned to areas where Irish is in general use should possess a sufficient knowledge of Irish to dispense with an interpreter only in so far as may be practicable. Recording a subjective view of a person's ability in the Irish language is no indication of the ability of that person to conduct court proceedings through Irish, which requires fluency. The fact that judges are not required to be fluent in the Irish language in no way reflects on their ability as judges. I do not propose to have statis<Col N="180" /> tics collected on matters that are not directly relevant to the question of suitability to be a judge.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 12, after line 48, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) For the purposes of this section a case shall be deemed to be partly heard only if the judge concerned has embarked upon the actual hearing of the case for a significant period of time and in particular a case shall not be deemed to be partly heard only by virtue of the fact that the judge has dealt with any interim or interlocutory aspect thereof or with the listing of the case for the purpose of fixing a date, the giving of directions, or any other purpose.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was the intention of the Minister, in inserting a retirement age for judges, that where a case had been commenced by a judge, he would hear the case to its conclusion, notwithstanding the passing of a chronological age. The amendment seeks clarity regarding the control of a case in order that a judge who has only preliminary dealings with a case does not regard it as necessary to continue with it for months beyond his or her statutory retirement date. The amendment is reasonable and fair in that it clarifies what judges should do in these circumstances and may lead to different attitudes being adopted with regard to the retirement date of judges. I hope the Minister has had a chance to reflect on the matter since Committee Stage and will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have broad sympathy with the basic premise that litigants are entitled to expect that the hearing of their case is not frustrated by matters outside their control. The provision I have inserted in the Bill provides that a judge who is appointed to a higher court may complete cases which he or she has partially heard in the lower court. I am satisfied that this progressive arrangement is sufficient to deal with the vast majority of cases which may arise in future and I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in question was the subject of consultation with the presidents of the various courts. It is important that a measure of discretion is given to the presidents in so far as the day to day running of court business is concerned. <Col N="181" /> This provision is flexible and achieves this. The flexible, discretionary approach is preferable to the one suggested by the Deputy which, while calling for statutory definition of &ldquo;partly heard&rdquo; is also very general in its approach in that it includes phrases such as &ldquo;significant period of time&rdquo; and &ldquo;any other purpose&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 6, to delete &ldquo;&euro;100,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&euro;70,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This series of amendments relates to the increased jurisdiction which the Minister proposes be extended to the Circuit Court. His proposal extends the current Circuit Court jurisdiction to litigation involving claims of up to &euro;100,000. This is a very broad extension of the present jurisdiction which gives rise to two problems. First, it is widely accepted and of great concern among the legal profession that the Circuit Court will have a huge amount of additional work as a consequence of the change and will lack both the resources and staff to cope. Second, there is a concern that, should the need to recruit and train additional staff cause a lengthy delay in implementing the change, it may in practical terms take another year to 18 months before the Circuit Court has the increased jurisdiction necessary to take into account not only inflation since 1981, but also the reality that cases which should really fall within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court are being dealt with at High Court level. These cases could be heard quicker and at less legal expense to the litigants involved in the Circuit Court. I propose, therefore, that the Circuit Court jurisdiction maximum be &euro;70,000 rather than &euro;100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By directing that claims be dealt with at Circuit Court level where they involve a sum not sufficiently substantial to go before the High Court, the Minister also had in mind the possibility of reducing insurance charges in the context of compensation claims for which insurance companies are liable. The insurance industry has expressed concern that, by raising the maximum order to such a dramatic degree, the provision may have the reverse effect to that intended by the Minister. This would result in increased compensation orders being made by the courts and higher insurance premiums for motor insurance and other general liability insurances. Were the Mini<Col N="182" /> ster to take on board my amendment, the resourcing of the Circuit Court to facilitate it coping with the additional jurisdiction would not be as great a difficulty as it might be otherwise.</P>
    <P>The second amendment deals with the District Court jurisdiction, which the Minister proposes to increase to &euro;20,000. I propose a figure of &euro;15,000 having regard, again, to the capacity of the District Court and the resources which may be needed as a result of the dramatic increase currently proposed. The very real concern is that it would detrimentally impact on the capacity of the District Court to deal with litigation in other areas such as family law. There is a substantial and growing backlog of family law cases in a number of District Courts. If the additional jurisdiction in general litigation is conferred on the District Court, the huge number of additional cases which would descend on it would create additional difficulties in terms of the time required to process family cases. For these reasons, I ask the Minister to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. There has been a great deal of debate outside the House on the proposed extension of jurisdiction, in particular, of the Circuit Court. There is a strong view emanating from legal circles, which is even stronger in the insurance industry, that it would have repercussions not envisaged by the Minister. I am minded, in particular, to listen to the insurance industry's argument that the measure will add to insurance costs. The Minister would be among the first to recognise that the one thing we do not need is further pressure on insurance costs.</P>
      <P>Insurance, whether public liability, motor vehicle or business insurance, has a huge impact on the viability of companies and the mobility of individuals. The viability of a number of companies, all of which have made representations to various Deputies, is at stake because of insurance costs. If the insurance industry alerts us to a real danger, it behoves us to respond in kind, not dismiss its real fears. If the measure leads to higher insurance costs, it will impact on employment in a very difficult period in which small firms are struggling. Insurance is already the second most onerous cost on companies after payroll costs and if matters continue, it will challenge payroll as the most significant cost. I seek an assurance from the Minister that these matters are being carefully analysed. Will he indicate to us what specific contacts and dialogue he or his officials had with the insurance industry in this regard and give an absolute assurance that the consequences people fear from this measure will not become a reality?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Deputies' concerns about the proposed increases and the monetary jurisdictions of the Circuit and District Courts which are envisaged in the Bill. I believe these concerns will prove to be unfounded. It is more than a decade since the jurisdiction limits <Col N="183" /> were last increased. The increases now provided for are being pitched at a realistic level and are appropriate to today's society. They will, I hope, remain valid for some time. As I am convinced they are appropriate, I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
      <P>In deciding on the levels of increase the Government was anxious to ensure that the resources available to our courts are used in a more rational and efficient manner. It is desirable that our citizens have easier access to the court system and that access should be at a level of cost which is not excessive. The jurisdiction increases are geared towards achieving these twin aims.</P>
      <P>I envisage that the impact of reduced costs will be beneficial both to the State, where it is a party to an action, and the individual litigant. We must trust our judges in terms of their competence in dealing with the increased jurisdiction limits. As to the need for increased resources, the proposed jurisdictional increases are to be brought into effect by ministerial order which will facilitate the appropriate timing of the changes. It is premature to assume our courts will not have the capacity to deal with the changes when introduced. I have confidence in the innate flexibility of our system. The impact of the changes will also be monitored from the outset. Should remedial measures be called for, any necessary action can be taken. I am not prepared to act hastily in this matter, however.</P>
      <P>Representations on the question of increasing the jurisdictions of the courts came from the self-insured task force group of public sector bodies. Representations were also received from the Irish Insurance Federation and from IBEC. I met them, listened to their arguments and told them I was not convinced that the proposed increase in jurisdictions would lead to increased claims and settlements. I instanced, for example, the proposal to establish a new personal injuries assessment board to provide an alternative and less costly means of determining damages &ndash; not liability &ndash; as something which may greatly impact on the whole area of personal injury litigation.</P>

      <P>I am conscious that on Report Stage the Minister may not get in again but I invite him to give one sentence to clarify something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I detailed my concerns and do not want to detail them again. I am sorry the Minister is unwilling to take them on board. I note from his contributions both on Committee Stage and today that he does not want to change these provisions but is saying he will not change them in a precipitate way. I agree with the Minister on one point &ndash; there is an urgent necessity to increase the jurisdiction of both the Circuit and District Courts, whose jurisdiction has remained unchanged since 1991 despite the increases in inflation since then. However, the Minister is not indicating to the House by what date he expects to bring in these provisions. My concern is that if <Col N="184" /> the Minister has pitched the increased jurisdiction too high, in a year or two he may still be looking for the resources to enable these provisions to be brought into force and instead of us improving the position regarding the courts, matters may remain as they are for a lengthy period.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to indicate when, should he still be in office after the next election, he would envisage making the ministerial order required to introduce the new extended jurisdiction in the Circuit and District Courts. While doing so will he indicate if he will introduce the new extended jurisdiction he is proposing in the family law area practically immediately? Those do not raise the concerns expressed here and really deal with the inflation issue. There is an urgent need to give the District Court, for example, a broader jurisdiction in granting maintenance support orders than it has at present and that has remained unchanged for 11 years.</P>

      <P>In page 19, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&ndash;Section 27 of the Act of 1995 is amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (6):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(6) Without prejudice to the provisions of Order 99, rules 12(1), 38(2), 29(12) and (14) of the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1986, or without prejudice to any enactment regulating the charging of fees payable in the Taxing Master's Office on the taking up of a certificate of taxation, on the taxation of a bill of costs (whether on a solicitor and client or party and party basis) no solicitor or legal cost accountant or other cost drawer shall be entitled to any fees, disbursements, charges or expenses in relation to the taxation of costs as against the opposing party, but save as against the party who incurred such fees, disbursements, charges or expenses.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> This is a somewhat complicated issue that has already been discussed at some length on Committee Stage. It is primarily to ensure that the successful litigant in a court case is not frustrated by the losing litigant in obtaining funds as a result of an order for costs made in favour of the successful litigant. I drew to the attention of the Minister a court judgment in 2001 which unexpectedly changed what had been the legal position going back to 1905 and this sought to redress the difficulty deriving from that court judgment.</P>
    <P>Without going over the ground I covered on Committee Stage and delaying the House in doing so, I add one further point. This issue is also of importance to the State because when the State is successful in litigation, gets an order for costs against an unsuccessful litigant and the Taxing Master of the High Court determines how much the unsuccessful litigant has to pay towards the legal costs incurred by the State, by lodging objections to the decision of the Taxing Master an unsuccessful litigant against whom an order for costs has been made may be able to string out for some time the possibility of the taxation of costs process being complete. As a consequence the State may be delayed from securing the costs to which it is entitled. On the basis of changes introduced to this Bill the unsuccessful litigant who behaves that way will suffer no serious interest penalty as a consequence of the Minister reducing the interest that accrues to costs in these circumstances from 8% to 2%.</P>
    <P>The amendment is not just to protect the successful private litigant who gets an order for costs but is also designed to protect the position of the State in recouping costs against those who are found to have brought proceedings wrongly against the State and against whom an order for costs has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that while I had some sympathy with the arguments which the Deputy put forward in support of this amendment, the matter needed to be looked at further. I also indicated that the area of taxation is a somewhat arcane branch of the law and was the subject of a detailed review in the context of a number of provisions advanced in the 1995 Courts and Court Officers Act.</P>
      <P>In the time available I have not been able to satisfy myself that the removal of the discretion provided for in Order 99, Rule 38(2) is inadvertent. I regret therefore that I am not in a position to accept this amendment at this time. While I am not accepting the amendment, the Deputy has raised an issue which warrants further consideration and if, on closer examination, there seems to be merit in restoring the discretion in question, I am sure the Minister of the day will be willing to incorporate an appropriate provision in a subsequent courts Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that objections to taxation are properly regarded as one aspect of the taxation process. The argument about drawing out proceedings is also applicable to the general taxation <Col N="186" /> process. For example, if one party is willing to agree costs the other can still insist on taxation. This highlights the fact that this may not be a net issue and must be viewed in a broader context. Therefore I have said there should be a willingness to examine this matter further and to deal with the issue if it proves necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is not willing to take this on board. The court case to which I referred is one which involved the State and in which the State appealed a High Court decision to the Supreme Court. It changed what had been the perceived legal position since 1905. In the circumstances I would have expected the Minister to welcome this amendment, which will inevitably be defeated today. I urge the Minister to go back and look at this amendment in the context of progressing this legislation before the Seanad. It is in the public interest to adopt this amendment and also in the interests of the State.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 23, to delete lines 33 to 43 and in page 24, to delete lines 1 to 25.</P>
      <P>This is a peculiar issue to have in a statute. The amendment seeks to delete section 37 which deals with the 2000 Act. All Acts referred to in the definitions section of this Bill are Courts Acts, with the exception of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which is known as the &ldquo;Act of 2000&rdquo; in section 37. Although the Minister says he is merely interested in preserving the <i>status quo</i>, it seems that is not the case, as we have enacted new planning legislation since the original Courts Acts. Part of the running process of planning legislation is to ensure the State and its agencies are subject to planning considerations in the same manner as other citizens. There are certain provisions for certain public works, such as the Part X provision, but it is important that the State does not, by and large, exempt itself from the planning laws it deems appropriate for everyone else. When the Supreme Court ruled on plans for an interpretative centre at Mullaghmore, my colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, argued that the right of the State to overrule normal planning should be extremely circumscribed.</P>
      <P>It is inappropriate to amend the Planning and Development Act as the Minister proposes in this section. I hope he has reflected on the matter since Committee Stage and that he will not proceed with this section. If he does proceed, it is incumbent on him to give a compelling reason for doing so. It is not good enough for him to say he is simply preserving the <i>status quo</i> of a Courts Act of many years ago. There needs to be a coherent reason why planning law introduced in 2000 should be amended and circumvented as is envisaged.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to object in principle to the fact that the courts service has a certain status in relation to planning matters. It should be borne in mind that enactment of the provisions of section 43 will ensure that the historical position of the courts in planning matters is maintained. If the courts service were to be subject to the full rigours of the Planning and Development Act, certain adverse consequences would ensue. For example, the time taken to complete planning procedures would increase from two months to a year. Delays in new projects would result in increased exponential and short-term repairs to buildings of a poor standard and expose the State to substantial inflationary pressures. There would be adverse cost implications for the courts service and its users if venues were closed, for whatever reason, without a temporary or permanent replacement venue being available from an early date because of the length of the planning permission process. There would be a loss of momentum in the capital programme and the capacity to respond urgently to acute accommodation problems would be reduced. Finally, there would be a risk of legal censure due to delays in meeting obligations arising from <i>mandamus </i>proceedings in respect of certain venues.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the courts service consults with Dúchas, An Taisce and local authorities on the restoration of courthouses and has a good record of sympathetic consideration. The proposal for the courts would put them in the same position as the Garda and the prisons service. I am conscious, as I am sure Deputy Howlin is, of the fact that we are dealing with an issue of security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's reasoning very unsatisfactory, as, in essence, he is telling us that the planning laws we deem appropriate for citizens are a hindrance to his Department. The argument that projects would be delayed is flawed, as developers and others involved in worthwhile commercial or social construction projects are subject to planning regulations in the normal manner. This House enacted the Planning and Development Act to create a framework for proper planning and development, but while that is grand for ordinary citizens, the Minister is saying it is too burdensome for his Department. It is not good enough that we should cut corners, to use a phrase which has been in vogue this week, in case a judge might say he cannot get on with his job quickly enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Department's argument that court buildings should be exempt from normal planning. There is a much more compelling argument in the case of a prison as it may be regarded as anti-social by those in its vicinity, but courts do not attract the same degree of opposition, by and large. Regardless of whether there is opposition, planning regulations should not be ignored on the grounds of being too burdensome. If they are genuinely burdensome, they should be <Col N="188" /> amended for everybody. The notion that the system is grand for everybody but not for court buildings is simply unsustainable in an era where planning is an extremely important issue and where views on planning are of paramount importance to those who defend them trenchantly. There is something unacceptable about inserting a small section in a Bill stating that planning legislation does not apply to State agencies, given that we have only recently enacted general provisions for planning, after years of preparation and debate.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for having failed abysmally:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;to improve our public services, noting that:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;there are 26,126 people on hospital waiting lists, unacceptably long delays for hospital treatment and people on very modest incomes denied access to free medical care;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;64,000 children at school have serious literacy problems and up to 850 primary schools are in a critical state of disrepair; </P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;house prices have soared by more than 80% over the past five years and home ownership is now beyond the reach of average wage-earners;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;no new road projects will start this year because of Government failure to provide funding;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;traffic congestion in Dublin and other urban centres has reached chronic levels; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;to tackle the underlying problems affecting the quality of people's lives, despite five years of unprecedented economic prosperity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> printed evidence of the Department of Finance confirming that medical card income limits being applied by the Department of Health and Children are &ldquo;too low&rdquo;. They are being kept low for <Col N="191" /> the poor in order to pay for medical cards for the rich. The result is that only 29% of the population is covered by a medical card, down from 37% when the Government took office.</P>
      <P>The current agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation allows for up to 40% of the population to be covered, but now a person living alone on &euro;128 per week is over the limit because the Minister has used up the available resources giving medical cards to millionaires who vote, in the knowledge that the election turnout in poorer areas can be as low as 30%.</P>
      <P>ESRI research shows that the death rate for males aged 55 and over is 32 per 1,000 among the poorest classes. This is three times the death rate for well paid males of the same age. Despite this, the Minister for Health and Children, on the eve of a by-election last summer, extended medical card cover to everybody over the age of 70 irrespective of income. He paid the Irish Medical Organisation five times the normal rate to overcome its resistance as it had been campaigning for an increase in the limit for the poor.</P>
      <P>The scandal does not end there. The cost of the Minister's actions was forecast at £14.75 million, &euro;19 million. The cost is now turning out to be more than twice that amount but the Minister, in a desperate bid to mislead, told me in a reply to a parliamentary question last week that he did not know the full cost. Following is the question and the reply:</P>
      <P>Mr. G. Mitchell asked the Minister for Health and Children the annual forecasted cost of providing medical cards for persons aged 70 and over when the scheme was approved and the cost in 2002?</P>
      <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): The original forecasted cost of providing medical cards for persons aged 70 and over was &euro;19 million approximately. This figure was based on a possible 39,000 eligible persons and is predominantly made up in capitation payments to doctors, other costs considered would include increased practice support grants and allowances. The most recent figures available to my Department suggest that the number of people in this age category is now in the region of 71,000.</P>
      <P>In relation to 2002 costs, my Department is working with the health boards and the GMS (Payments) Board to determine the likely full year costs having regard to the evidence which suggests that people in the age category continue to register. As part of this work an assessment will be made of the offsetting savings emerging within the drug payments scheme following the transfer of persons aged 70 and over to the GMS scheme. It is not possible, therefore, to put an accurate figure on full year costs for 2002 at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What ever happened to accountability? Surely the accounting officer of the Department of <Col N="192" /> Health and Children knows what the cost is? If the accounting officer does not know, what do the Estimates procedures in the House mean? We provide &euro;19 million for this purpose for a possible 39,000 eligible persons and when it turns out to be 71,000 the Minister tells the House he does not know what it will cost. What an extraordinary claim to make in this House. I do not accept that is a truthful answer. Somebody in the Department of Health and Children or in the Department of Finance must know what the cost is and we, as the representatives of the taxpayer, are entitled to know the cost. This is either gross misleading of the House or gross incompetence. In either case it is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The result of this is that there is no money left to fund medical cards for the poor and the Minister for Finance will not pay the new rate for poor people who need medical cards. Is it any wonder that accident and emergency departments are swamped with people who cannot afford to go to a GP? </P>
    <P>Patients' representative bodies should consider seeking a judicial review of this typical example of medical apartheid. It is a scandal of enormous proportions that health spending can be manipulated for political benefit in this way.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Health and Children to confirm or deny this during this debate and to debate this matter with me so that the public may judge for themselves as to the accuracy of my claim. Fine Gael is committed to doubling medical card income limits immediately on return to Government as part of our detailed policy proposals to take pressure off secondary care hospitals by a targeted investment in primary care, GPs and pharmacies. Deliberate apartheid in the medical services is costing lives. It has got to stop.</P>
    <P>In a few weeks' time the electorate will face a decision whether to re-elect the current Government or to elect a Fine Gael led alternative. The Government tells us it has provided good government. I tell this House it presided over chaos and has perpetuated and extended apartheid in the health services. Some of us might feel smug if we are on the inside track but some day it may be one of us who is left out, or a spouse, child, parent or brother or sister. Those left out are somebody's loved ones. We must ensure that when it comes to health services nobody is left out.</P>
    <P>In the most basic function of the State, the provision of an adequate health service, the Government has failed. Fine Gael will deliver an imaginative, costed reform package which will work and which will be our priority in government.</P>
    <P>This Government mistakes spending money for achieving results. It tells us correctly that it has doubled health spending but neglect to mention that with more resources than any other, has failed dismally to improve the health system.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, like his mentor Mr. Haughey, was obviously unaware of the crisis facing the health services. The Taoiseach told us before the Ballymascanlon Cabinet meeting on health that <Col N="193" /> we had a first class health service. This was at the same time as waiting lists in the Mater Hospital, in the heart of his constituency, were growing by nearly 50%.</P>
    <P>This has been a great Government for grand announcements but no follow through. The Minister, Deputy Martin, and his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, at last count had commissioned over 107 task forces, forums, expert groups and implementation bodies, but precious little has been delivered. After five years and &euro;30 billion of expenditure, the Fianna Fáil Government's record on health shows that over 26,300 people suffer on public waiting lists and thousands more &ndash; the <i>Irish Examiner </i>states perhaps 100,000 more &ndash; wait on a list to get on a waiting list. Ordinary decent hard working people are denied access to a medical card as the Government refuses to properly raise the eligibility thresholds while planning to spend hundreds of millions on the Bertie bowl.</P>
    <P>A person earning over &euro;130 gross a week is denied a medical card and must face a doctor's bill of &euro;35 per visit and medicine costs of up to &euro;53 per month. As a result poor people delay going to the doctor or go to already grossly overburdened accident and emergency departments. There are delays of over eight years in some areas before receiving orthodontic treatment even though a treatment purchase scheme was announced over 12 months ago but has still not been delivered.</P>
    <P>The childhood vaccination programme is in chaos. Poor distribution systems and a totally inadequate public information campaign to address parental concerns have left our children vulnerable to preventable illness and maybe even death.</P>
    <P>Pensioners in nursing homes have had their pitiful savings illegally taken by the State and, in some cases, they still have not been repaid nine years later. We have the worst life expectancy in the European Union and grandchildren are deprived of the company of their grandparents sooner than anywhere else in Europe. In life expectancy, we compare badly with Europe but the House might note that Europe itself lags behind Canada. Why do we continue to accept these standards?</P>
    <P>We have among the highest rates of death from cancer in the European Union but there is still no nationwide breast screening programme. Nursing shortages have lead to the loss of nearly 66,000 bed days in our hospitals in the 18 months from January 2000 to June 2001, despite the fact there are over 20,000 qualified nurses not currently working in the state health system but available if an attractive enough package was made available to them. How does the Minister, Deputy Martin, respond to the nursing situation? The House will have guessed &ndash; by announcing another forum last week. It is time for leadership not more prevarication.</P>
    <P>Michael McDowell, the Attorney General, spoke recently about how this Government had achieved social justice. There is nothing socially <Col N="194" /> just about a 68 year old man waiting two years for a hip replacement while a neighbour with the money to pay can have it done tomorrow. There is nothing socially just about a family with two children earning just above the national minimum wage of &euro;178 having to pay &euro;35 per doctor's visit and &euro;53 a month for medication for their asthmatic child while a retired 70 year old banker gets totally free GP care and medication.</P>
    <P>It is time for change. It is time for a Government committed to building a fair, efficient and accountable health service. Fine Gael, in its health proposals, has set out how over the next five years it will construct a health service where medical need not material circumstances will determine access to care. Fine Gael will invest in an enhanced primary care system not just flagship primary care centres in urban areas and ensure access to primary care through the provision of medical cards to those in need. We will on return to Government immediately double the current paltry income medical card eligibility limits. We will introduce a free GP service targeted at those most in need, the lowest paid 60% of the population, children up to 18 years and beyond that if in full-time education and those aged 65 and older. We will add asthma to the long-term illness scheme to ease the burden on the 250,000 asthmatics and their families of a monthly bill of &euro;53 for essential medication. We will introduce an insurance-based scheme for all to ensure access for all to necessary hospital care. We will introduce a system of citizen based hospital boards and make hospital managements tender every seven years for the contract to run the hospital facility. In short, we will introduce the most comprehensive reform of the health services since 1940 when the Department of Health itself was set up. We will create the Office of Surgeon General to work directly for the Oireachtas in securing greater accountability. We will introduce a covenant of rights and responsibilities for patient's to be overseen by a dedicated health ombudsman. We will provide the resources but we will insist on accountability for their use.</P>
    <P>Some 54 years ago a Fine Gael-led Government transformed the health of the nation when Noel Browne virtually eliminated the scourge of TB. The challenge now may even be greater. However, with a targeted plan we can achieve the necessary change. We can ensure that people need no longer fear that when they get sick they will not be able to afford or access care. Fine Gael, as a Christian Democrat party, believes centrally in enterprise and social justice. We must create wealth and the jobs that go with it. We must use that wealth to deliver social justice. We will, in government, continue to nurture and encourage enterprise but unlike the current Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration, we will also seek to ensure social justice and nowhere more strongly than in building a reformed health service.</P>
    <P>In the coming election, people face a real choice between a Government committed to <Col N="195" /> building a new health system or a Government committed to more public relations gimmicks but no real improvements. It is time to make the change and start delivering the health system our people want and deserve. I make this House a promise: we in Government will end apartheid in the health services. We will give this country a health service second to none and available to all and which is fair, efficient and effective &ndash; a health service which is the envy of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The words to describe this Government in recent times and as we enter the dying days of this Dáil are &ldquo;lack of management&rdquo;. I have no doubt the key focus in the election campaign will be in the area of management. Good sound management of the economy is needed by the next Government if we are to maintain the success of recent economic growth. Never before has a Government spent so much public money and delivered so little in terms of improved services and quality of life.</P>
      <P>Irish people are quite rightly proud of the economic progress here since the early 1990s. Since 1993, we have raised output almost 100%, increased the total number at work by over 0.5 million and reduced unemployment from 16% to 4%. By any standards, these have been wonderful achievements. We have been the envy of many countries.</P>
      <P>Predictably, the present Government likes to claim all the credit for these achievements. This is a false claim for two reasons. One reason is that the rapid economic growth in recent years was due in considerable measure to what was happening in the rest of the world, that is, the buoyancy of the international economy, particularly in the US and UK, the tremendous vitality of the global high-tech sector, the unusually low level of international interest rates and so on. A second reason is that while Ireland was well positioned to take advantage of these favourable circumstances, this was principally due to policies put in place in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s rather than policies implemented over the last five years. I am thinking of the great expansion of our education system throughout the 1960s and 1970s; the opening up of our economy to overseas investment; the fine work of the IDA throughout this time; the enhancement of our infrastructure, especially the upgrading of our telecommunications infrastructure in the 1980s; and the painful correction of our public finances also in the 1980s after the disastrous policy errors of the previous decade, most notably the infamous Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, or anybody on the Government benches cannot claim any credit whatever for these policies which provided the necessary foundation stones for our recent success. Indeed, the current Government can rightly be accused of dissipating this wonderful legacy by its handling of the public finances and its inad<Col N="196" /> equate response to the economy's infrastructure requirements. A Government should be assessed on the policies it pursues and not on its good fortune in reaping the harvest from the sound policies pursued by its predecessors.</P>
    <P>Of course, statistics on GDP, employment and unemployment tell us only part of the story of the so-called Celtic tiger era. There is another side to the coin which requires examination. Consider the circumstances of a typical young couple, both working, with small children. Ten years ago one or both of them might have been unemployed or might have had to emigrate. Their take-home pay is considerably higher than that of a corresponding couple ten years ago. Their jobs are likely to be more interesting and more highly skilled. They are also likely to own a bigger, better and brighter array of consumer goods. In all these respects, they reflect the success of the economy &ndash; higher output, higher employment and lower unemployment. However, what about their quality of life? They are not happier and their quality of life is a good deal inferior than the corresponding couple a decade ago for reasons that reflect Government policy failure.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, they are likely to live much further from their places of work. If they work in Dublin, for example, there is a good chance that they live 30 to 50 miles away. Hundreds commute on a daily basis from my constituency to the capital. I dare say thousands commute from the Minister's constituency of Meath. The reason is that this is where affordable housing is now being built, namely in small rural villages and towns that do not possess the social or economic infrastructure to cope with substantial population increases. This is a crazy and has its roots in policy failure. There has been policy failure in planning, the provision of housing and the location of employment.</P>
    <P>Of course, our couple will have to devote a much larger proportion of their day to travelling to and from work. This is not only because the distance they have to cover is much longer, but because they are likely to be competing for limited road space with large numbers of others making the same journey. It is not now uncommon for people to spend two to four hours a day in their cars getting to and from work. One does not have to travel from Laois-Offaly or Meath to spend three hours in a car, one can do so travelling within the confines of this city. Sitting in a car for hours on end represents an enormous loss of quality of life. The economic statistics of which the Government likes to boast are entirely silent on this issue and again reflect policy failure. In particular it reflects the failure to provide an adequate system of mass transit in a small island. This failure is a failure of management.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of child care. The rapid economic growth of the past decade or so has seen a big increase in the proportion of women with children deciding to remain in or re-enter the workforce. Indeed, a significant fraction of the growth that has occurred would not have <Col N="197" /> occurred were it not for this factor. This has hugely increased the demand for child care. At the same time it has reduced the number of women available to provide child care facilities for others and has resulted in a big increase in child care costs. The problem of accessing affordable and reliable child care has become serious. It is a particularly serious problem for couples whose search for affordable housing brings them to rural areas with a social infrastructure utterly inadequate to cope with the increase in population that has been thrust upon them. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government speaks of the national spatial strategy working in conjunction with the national development plan. Because the national spatial strategy requires Deputy Dempsey to make choices it will not be published during the lifetime of his Government.</P>
    <P>Housing is also the responsibility of Deputy Dempsey's Department. There are 1,800 people on the housing list in Laois, almost 1,000 of whom are in Portlaoise. Never before have we had such a waiting list. Nor have we had a Government which shows such little intent of dealing with the matter. Planning in rural areas is another matter for which Deputy Dempsey has responsibility. He refuses to bite the bullet on this issue. The sons and daughters of farmers are now being denied the opportunity to live in areas near their families and friends. They are told they must get a site of at least two acres in size, otherwise they will not get planning permission from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The complete lack of managerial competence at Government level is exposed in the operation of the national development plan, with which Deputy Dempsey is much associated. The national roads programme is grinding to a halt. No major road project will commence this year. The Monasterevin, Ennis, Carrickmacross and Cashel bypasses and the Sligo town relief road are all at construction stage but no funding is available for these projects. The Kildare bypass will be completed in about three year's time but the Monasterevin bypass will only be starting. Traffic is being rushed from one bottleneck to another six miles further down the road. The National Roads Authority reveals a total absence of any kind of forward planning.</P>
    <P>As we begin year three of the national development plan there is an immediate need for an urgent review of all aspects of the national roads programme. Specifically the Government needs to put in place a management system and professional expertise capable of implementing the plan within the timescale. The national development plan proposes to eliminate the infrastructural deficit which is severely hindering Ireland's ambition to be a world class economy. Business and enterprise is suffering. The failure to meet targets under the NDP is just one of many failures on the part of the Government. Essentially the Government lacks management.</P>
    <P>Given the ramshackle state of our transport infrastructure, the deficiencies in relation to child care, the shambles that is our health service and <Col N="198" /> the 850 schools in need of urgent repair, one would be forgiven for thinking that the Government had been penny-pinching in public spending. Of course the opposite is the case. Education facilities in my constituency have been left in abeyance over the past five years. The programme promised by Deputy Martin and his successor at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to facilitate funding under public private partnerships for two new secondary schools in Portlaoise, a new vocational school and three new primary schools remains unattended to as we enter the dying days of this Administration. Children occupy little more than a live-in shed at Lumcloon school in Cloghan, County Offaly. Charleville national school in Tullamore, Clareen national school in Birr, Daingean national school in north Offaly, Crettyard national school in south Laois, Rathdowney nation school &ndash; whose amalgamation five years ago was never completed as one half of the school is at one end of the town with the other at the other end &ndash; Clonenagh Church of Ireland school in Mountrath, Rathdowney Church of Ireland school &ndash; unattended despite an application of many years standing for grant aid and funding from the Department &ndash; all require funding. Instead of building or renovating schools and meeting the targets set for school development, the Government's legacy for education in Laois-Offaly is the closure of Ballyfin College, one of the finest secondary schools in the land.</P>
    <P>Poor transport infrastructure, deficiencies in child care, the shambles that passes for our health service and the 850 schools in need of repair are the hallmarks of a Government engaged in a such a high degree of fiscal rectitude as to require cut back after cut back. Of course that was not the case. Penny-pinching has not been a mark of the Government. Rather it wishes to approve hundreds of millions of taxpayer's euro into ego monuments in west County Dublin and national acquatic centres which now unravel as very serious questions begin to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Government spending is now growing at a record rate. As recently as 1999, gross current supply services spending amounted to less than &euro;20 billion. This year the figure will be more than &euro;30 billion, an increase of more than 50% in just three years, or over 15% per annum on average. Over the same period, capital spending will have risen by 70%, or almost 20% per annum. These are frightening rates of increase. If sustained, they would either require big increases in tax rates or a return to large scale Government borrowing. The Government has not committed itself to either. It has ducked the crucial question as it has no management structure in place that amounts to any form of medium to long-term planning. Deputy McCreevy tells us to party as we have never had it so good, that the Celtic tiger continues to roll along, and that we should spend, spend. This is leading us to this position where if the Government sustains the current level of public spending, it must either increase tax rates or <Col N="199" /> return to large scale borrowing, both of which it refuses to countenance. Will the Minister present tell us which choice it will make? We do not hear about this as it is a hard choice and the Government does not make hard choices of any description.</P>
    <P>The immediate question that must now be posed is how public spending can grow so rapidly while the quality of so many public services remains appallingly low and others continue to deteriorate. I represent a constituency embracing two rural counties in the midlands stretching from the River Barrow at Carlow to the Shannon at Clonmacnoise and, in the dying days of this Government and the Celtic tiger, there has been very little investment or progress there but a great deal of job losses and neglect. There must be a shake-up in the country's leadership and Administration as far as the midlands are concerned.</P>
    <P>The fault for this massive failure lies clearly with the Taoiseach and the Tanáiste. In essence, they, and Deputy Dempsey, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, have squandered the greatest economic boom the country has ever seen. This is the last Private Member's motion of the current Dáil. Clearly, there has been management failure over a wide range of areas. This Government must be replaced before any further damage is inflicted on the Irish economy, or any more trauma inflicted on the hard pressed people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. It is a fact that the Government has not improved public services. The points made in this motion stand up to scrutiny and the Government has failed in many areas. Our public services are in a shambles and the national development plan is a year and a half behind schedule with a 40% expenditure overrun. Fine Gael proposes that, when in Government, it will borrow money to complete the plan's capital projects by 2006, which is the type of radical thinking needed.</P>
      <P>There are many issues regarding education that I could raise. The response from the Minister, when I raised these issues before, was totally inadequate. I have two letters from educationalists in my constituency. One is from Ballinamore post-primary school, which is inviting its two local Deputies to a meeting next week, because a decision was taken to amalgamate the town's three schools over a year ago but nothing has been heard from the Department of Education and Science since. I tabled a parliamentary question some months ago and was informed that this matter would be dealt with. Unfortunately, since then, an inspector has visited the area only once. The people of Ballinamore, my native town, are frustrated because they have no information and do not know when the money will be made available for the new school. This is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second letter is from St. Brigid's national school in Drumkeerin, County Leitrim, whose <Col N="200" /> board of management is unable to fill two posts because of the scarcity of teachers. The school is not included in the new rural disadvantage scheme, although it is located in one of the most disadvantaged rural areas. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government visited it recently and knows that it is disadvantaged in many ways. I cannot get any answer from the Minister responsible as to why the school is excluded from the scheme. The primary school in Mohill, County Leitrim, is in a deplorable condition. The Minister gave the go-ahead to build a new school and the board of management was told to gather the local contribution, which it did, but the Minister has not responded and the building cannot go ahead. The same situation has arisen in Carrowreagh, County Sligo, where the school is also awaiting the Department's contribution. No one knows what the Minister for Education and Science is doing. He has often been asked to draw up a priority list to fund schools but will not do so. Why will he not provide the funding for the Ursuline college in Sligo? Such bad politics creates cynicism and explains why the educational system is in uproar.</P>
    <P>Speaking as spokesman on western development, some proposals are necessary to develop the western region. Fine Gael believes that the region's population should double over the next 15 years. All infrastructural development in the national development plan for this region should be completed by 2006, which the Government is failing to do because it will not borrow the necessary money. The Sligo inner relief road, for example, which is vital to develop Sligo town, was supposed to receive funding. The National Roads Authority gave it only &euro;1.27 million, when &euro;12 million is necessary to complete the project. A local Fianna Fáil Deputy said that the Department, in a kind of three card trick, would finance the funding of a loan from Sligo County Council to allow &euro;2 million to progress the road, but that money is not enough. Is this a new departure by the NRA which is supposed to have responsibility for roads instead of the Department? Perhaps the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, would clarify that.</P>
    <P>I raised on the Order of Business the issue of Deputy Jacob, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, misleading this House over the Bill on gas regulation when he said that towns were selected for the new gas pipeline on a commercial basis. Then the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, sent out a statement to the local and national press to the effect that if it were not for his intervention with Bord Gáis, there would have been no pipeline to Galway. He had the temerity to stand up in the House and say that two pipelines would be connected to Galway. We could do with a few pipelines in other western regions, and I am sure the Acting Chairman would like to see one connected to Donegal rather than connecting two pipelines to Galway. <Col N="201" /> If that is political expediency in the name of regional development, it is time it was stopped.</P>

      <P>1.&nbsp;acknowledges the Government's achievement in relation to health care and in particular:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the Government for its unparalleled increases in health funding;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the Government's new Health Strategy which is firmly grounded in the principles of equity, accountability, fairness and people-centredness;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;commends the Government for extending eligibility for medical cards to all people over 70 years of age;</P>

      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the targeting of substantial extra resources and support services for disadvantaged children and children with learning difficulties, including specific measures to improve literacy levels;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;major progress in upgrading, modernising and providing new school accommodation as a result of a fourfold increase in capital funding for this purpose; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;looks forward to the continuation of these positive developments over the coming years,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" />3.&nbsp;welcomes the significant achievements by the Government in the housing area since 1997 and notes:</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the comprehensive range of measures introduced to increase the supply of housing which have given rise to successive levels of record housing output in each of the last five years, culminating in the completion of 52,000 housing units in 2001, and the overall provision of 216,000 housing units in the Government's term;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the significant moderation in house price increases from a peak of 40% in 1998 to about 5 &ndash; 6% in the 12 months to end-September 2001;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;that first-time buyers have been afforded greater participation in the housing market; and</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the record level of funding of &euro;1.7 billion for housing in 2002 which is 3 times the amount provided in 1997,</P>
    <P>4.&nbsp;welcomes the fact that good progress is being maintained with the development of the roads network as mandated in the National Development Plan and, in particular, notes that:</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the total 2002 Exchequer provision for the national roads improvement programme is &euro;958 million, which represents an increase of &euro;50 million on the 2001 outturn, is more than three times the 1997 level of expenditure;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the Exchequer investment of nearly &euro;2.5 billion which will have been made in national road improvements for the first 3 years of the NDP (to end 2002), is already more than &euro;260 million or some 10% in excess of the planned NDP profile;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the NRA programme will see over 20 major projects being taken forward during 2002;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;record funding of over &euro;438 million is being provided to maintain and improve the non-national road network,</P>
    <P>5.&nbsp;welcomes the achievements of the Government in tackling traffic congestion in Dublin and other urban centres and, in particular:</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the progressive implementation of the NDP which provides for the investment of &euro;12 billion in transport over the 2002-06 period and the demonstrable progress made in 2000 and 2001 in implementing this investment programme;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the significant increase in capital investment in public transport during the lifetime of the Government, including the provision of over &euro;400 million in <Col N="203" /> Exchequer capital funding for public transport in 2002;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;welcomes the progress being made with regard to the Dart network, Luas and the Metro and the significant increase in bus numbers both in Dublin and provincial areas;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the DTI Strategy update &ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo; provides a comprehensive, updated framework for meeting Dublin's transport needs;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the progress being made in the upgrading of the national road network in the Greater Dublin area where work has commenced on the Dublin Port Tunnel, the South-Eastern Motorway, the Cloghran-Balbriggan Motorway, Kildare bypass and Glen of the Downs project and in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford where major projects have either been completed in recent years, are under way or are well advanced in planning, and</P>
    <P>6.&nbsp;congratulates the Government on five years of unprecedented economic and employment growth and the many successful steps taken during that period to tackle the underlying problems affecting the quality of peoples lives.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to tell Deputy Reynolds that some time ago the Government gave a commitment that the gas pipeline would go to the north west, which I am sure he welcomes. I am sure also that Leitrim will continue to benefit from the other measures that have been put in place by this Government over the past five years, particularly in the upper Shannon region. I have visited Leitrim on several occasions and it is thriving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not encroach into the area of responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, but I was intrigued by some of the mathematics used by Deputy Gay Mitchell who said Fine Gael would extend medical card coverage to up to 60% of the population and give medical cards to everybody over 18 and over 65. If my understanding of the demography of this country is correct, he has approximately 110% coverage of the population in all of that. The Deputy appeared to have great difficulty with the idea of the over 70s getting medical cards, as announced by the Minister for Health and Children last year. He talked about bankers over the age of 70 getting a medical card yet he is proposing that bankers over the age of 65 should have a medical card. He either agrees or disagrees with the principle of free medical cards for <Col N="204" /> everybody, but he should make up his mind. The public will not be as confused about these matters as Deputy Mitchell appears to be currently.</P>
    <P>When I saw the Fine Gael Private Members' motion before the House tonight I thought to myself that some things never change. Here we go again; the same old Fine Gael scatter-gun approach. It is a motion that does not have the slightest hint of any kind of focus and includes everything bar the kitchen sink. It shows that the Fine Gael Party is in complete disarray in terms of policy and does nothing more than justify its abysmal showing in the poll ratings. It cannot even agree on a focused motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>One can picture the discomfort rippling around the table as no one could find a single area of Government policy on which to have a full debate. Why? Because they knew they could not sustain an attack on the Government in any one area and that its record gives them barren soil on which to try to sow the seeds of anything like a meaningful attack. It does not make any odds to those of us on this side of the House. The more issues Fine Gael wants to raise with us, the more opportunity we get to set out the strength of our record. That is what my colleagues and I will do during the course of this debate. I should have said at the outset that my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, intends to speak for 15 minutes with the approval of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office in 1997, this Government has prioritised the upgrading of our economic and social infrastructure. Our vision was, and still is, one of a first class infrastructure supporting the development of a first world economy yielding a first rate quality of life. This Government's superb management of the economy delivered the resources necessary to upgrade our physical infrastructure. Our national development plan <Col N="205" /> provides a total investment of &euro;24 billion in infrastructure programmes, coming within the remit of my Department, in key areas like national and non-national roads, housing, environmental infrastructure, waste management and urban and village development. Excellent progress has been made in the first two years of the NDP in the roll-out of this investment programme. That is due to the fact that we have a clear view of what we wish to achieve. Building on our success in obtaining record levels of economic and employment growth, which have greatly improved the living conditions we enjoy, the NDP provides a clear framework for the transformation of our economic and social infrastructure. That is in stark contrast to the Opposition parties which have achieved the exalted status of failing to articulate a single coherent statement of what they see as the key challenges, never mind how they might be remedied.</P>
    <P>I want to examine road investment, one of the key programmes within my own remit. In relation to national roads, excellent progress has been made with the development of the national network as mandated in the national development plan, including the advancement of the five major inter-urban routes. The NDP provides for investment of &euro;5.6 billion in national road improvements over the period 2000 to 2006, a threefold increase on the previous NDP.</P>
    <P>In relation to national roads, the irrefutable facts are that the Exchequer provision for 2002, at &euro;958 million, is more than three times the 1997 level &ndash; the last time the rainbow Government was in coalition &ndash; and nearly twice the 1999 level. Over the period 2000 to 2002, the Exchequer provision for national road improvement, at &euro;2.488 billion, is more than &euro;260 million in excess of what is provided for in the NDP. Not only does Fine Gael get its figures wrong about medical cards, it also gets it wrong in relation to roads. We are &euro;260 million ahead of what we provided for in the national development plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to invite the Minister to County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That level of investment has enabled a rapid acceleration of the national roads development programme. Since 1997, a substantial number of towns, including Nenagh, Portlaoise, Roscrea, Balbriggan, Cavan, Donegal and Arklow, have been bypassed, with obvious benefits accruing to the towns from the removal of through traffic and an improvement in quality of life for the people living in those towns. The implementation of the national roads development plan provided for in the NDP will remove through traffic from more than 60 towns and villages</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2002 provision will fund ongoing construction on over 20 major projects throughout the country. The programme has not come to a halt, as Fine Gael appears to think. The provision will also fund forward planning and design of major <Col N="206" /> projects on the major inter-urban routes as well as many others, details of which are set out in the material circulated to the Deputies. By any standard, this is a major programme of work and when taken together with all of the projects completed since 1997, it represents a major upgrading of the national road network.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion claims, in particular, that no new road projects will start this year. That overlooks the following facts: the N22 Ballincollig and the N11 Ashford-Rathnew bypasses have recently got under way; the NRA anticipates that contracts will be awarded later this year for the N4 Kilcock-Kinnegad and the N25 Waterford bypass PPP projects; and over 20 major projects already under way will upgrade some 200 kilometres of national roads &ndash; 130 kilometres to motorway or dual carriageway standard.</P>
    <P>Investment in national roads is being complemented by record investment in non-national roads. Almost &euro;2.5 billion is to be invested in this backbone of rural transport over the life of the national development plan. This year alone, over &euro;438 million is being provided in State grants, a doubling of the 1997 provision.</P>
    <P>More than &euro;221 million is being provided on the restoration programme which aims, by the end of 2005, to restore local and regional roads in county council areas which were deficient in 1995. Nearly 25,000 kilometres of non-national roads have been improved under this programme.</P>
    <P>The 2002 allocations include a further &euro;50 million in non-national road grants to support housing and other related developments. That will provide grant assistance to local authorities in the greater Dublin area, the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and adjoining counties where housing demand is highest and for certain strategic non-national roads to support housing, industrial-commercial and other developments. That Exchequer funded scheme will provide grant aid of more than &euro;246 million in the 2001-04 period to 42 projects. If the most extensive road building programme in the history of the State seems to be regarded as one of the best avenues of attack on the Government, what does that say about the Opposition? It says we have an Opposition that is even more nervous, desperate and misguided and out of touch than ever before.</P>
    <P>Meeting mobility needs and dealing with traffic congestion is not only about investment in roads. The sustained economic success and prosperity the country has experienced in recent years has resulted in real and tangible benefits in terms of jobs, living standards and quality of life generally. One of the more obvious challenges posed by this growth is increased traffic, particularly in urban areas. The Government has been proactive in responding to this challenge and to the urgent need to upgrade our transport infrastructure in Dublin and other urban centres to alleviate traffic congestion. While the Opposition may wish to deny it, we have made good progress in the implementation of an integrated and well functioning public transport network.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" />Investment in roads has been complemented by our sustained and coherent programme of investment in public transport. Government capital investment there has risen from &euro;8 million in 1997 under the rainbow coalition Government to &euro;424 million in 2002 &ndash; that is a total capital investment of more than &euro;1.2 billion during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>The resulting improvements are significant and they have been outlined in the House in great detail by the Minister for Public Enterprise on many occasions. I do not intend to go back over them. If only for the purpose of making one more attempt to educate the Opposition on this issue, the material circulated gives comprehensive details on what has been achieved in terms of the rail network and Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann networks.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Luas project continues to advance. A preferred bidder to operate the service has been selected. The trams continue to arrive at the rate of two per month and the contract for operating the system will be awarded shortly. The lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green are progressing and are still on target for completion by end 2003. The depot at the Red Cow is completed and fitting-out is taking place. Work on laying a test track from the depot to Kingswood in Tallaght has begun. It is expected that track testing will commence in April 2002.</P>
    <P>In January, the Government approved the commencement of the procurement process for phase 1 of the Dublin metro, which will make a major contribution to resolving Dublin's traffic problems. The metro will be developed as a public private partnership and the Government has approved a policy framework for rail based PPPs, which will be used in the implementation of the metro project. The Railway Procurement Agency is carrying out passenger modelling and route alignment studies on the proposed metro route.</P>
    <P>In addition to investment in individual modes of public transport, we recognise that better integration between public transport modes, and between public and private transport, is of major importance. To that end, a total of &euro;63.5 million has been set aside to promote integration in the greater Dublin area in a practical way. The provision of quality bus corridors, the deregulation of taxis, traffic management and other measures have been put in place. The Government is committed to a greater Dublin area land use and transportation authority, in respect of which the heads of a Bill will be submitted to Government shortly. In addition, the DTI strategy, A Platform for Change, outlines more than &euro;16 billion in investment over the next 15 years, which will go a long way to resolving the difficulties that exist in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. I would like, specifically, to <Col N="208" /> address the part of the Fine Gael motion where the House is invited to condemn the Government in relation to the health service.</P>
      <P>While the advisers to its leader are busy attempting a last minute dramatic reinvention of his style, the basic thrust of the motions put before the House remains the same. Every week we hear another tirade, using selective or invented statistics in an ever more desperate attempt to undermine the Government's standing.</P>
      <P>The Opposition as a whole has been extremely inventive in the different tasks it has taken. My favourite remains the way in which Labour and Fine Gael believe that we should be held accountable for the major increase in waiting lists which took place in their last six months in office. To that can be added the display we saw in the House earlier when Fine Gael attempted to attack the Minister for Defence and the Government for implementing a decision for which its leader had lobbied. Never letting facts get in the way of an attack and never missing an opportunity to trade on innuendo, the tactic of playing the man not the ball is alive and well and played out with ever more predictable regularity on our airwaves.</P>
      <P>The bottom line on our record on health is that we have cut waiting lists, dramatically increased investment, provided new services, hired new professionals and provided the most comprehensive blueprint for development and reform in the history of our health services. Let us nail one lie here and now, implementation of the health strategy is not only well under way, critical aspects of it are ahead of time. More than &euro;250 million is being spent to develop the services outlined in the strategy. In just one area, hospital treatment, the first expansion in bed capacity in decades is under way &ndash; 709 beds are coming onstream this year versus an original target of 650 beds. Some &euro;113 million is being provided to reduce waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
      <P>Compare this to the record of the leaders of the Opposition when they were taking the decision. Deputies Noonan and Quinn looked into their hearts and decided that waiting list funding needed to be cut and reduced it to &euro;10 million in 1997. Five years on, in spite of regular requests, both refuse to justify this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When coming into office the Government recognised the need to improve the level of investment in the health services. I am pleased to record that we have achieved our goal, but we recognise that more is required. Future policy is clearly set out in our health strategy and the reviews of primary care and of bed capacity. I am continuing these improvements during 2002. Some basic facts, which cannot be refuted, are that ongoing revenue spending on the health services for 2002 is approaching &euro;7.7 billion; on the capital side, the 2002 spending level is &euro;497 million; and, as a percentage of GNP, health revenue expenditure now stands at 7.8%, which is the highest figure in almost 20 years. We, as a <Col N="209" /> Government, have delivered an increase of 125% in funding for the health services.</P>
    <P>The establishment by Government of a national development plan represents the single most important event in the development of the health capital infrastructure. In 2002, funding of &euro;497 million is available, the largest ever capital programme agreed by a Government for the health services. The 2002 funding represents a 33% increase on the 2001 outturn. This funding will allow for the continued progression of major projects in the health sector such as hospitals and community facilities. Every region in the country has a major investment programme in its health facilities and equipment.</P>
    <P>The staffing of our health services continues to be another of those critical issues affecting our ability to meet the increasing service demands across all programmes. The total staffing figures for the public health services have increased from about 68,000 in 1997 to about 86,000 at the end of 2001. That is an extra 18,000 people. As a consequence of the increased funding provided in 2002, this number will rise by approximately 6,000 to 92,000 overall.</P>
    <P>I will give the House some more facts. A total of 1,640 places nationally will be available from this year on the new nursing degree programme. This is a record number of places. The recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving with a net increase of 1,896 as of 31 October 2001. There are 340 more consultants than in 1997. We have developed the National Health Strategy to move away from short-term approaches to planning and to provide a blueprint for the whole health system to realise ambitious and wide-ranging change over the next seven to ten years. The Government's commitment to health as a key priority area is underlined by the ambitious targets set in the strategy. As I said at the outset, this year is seeing major funding for the strategy and major progress in implementing it.</P>
    <P>Equity in health care is one of the principles on which our new health strategy is based and one which this Government is committed to addressing in the implementation of the strategy and through service developments across the board. The overriding necessity here is the need for access to services. Services need to be built up, waiting lists reduced and activity increased and specific groups such as children and those with disabilities require targeted service developments to address previous neglect and unmet need to ensure equity. A broad strategic focus is essential to deal with these sort of problems and no single narrow approach will address the real need for better, more equitable health care services for all.</P>
    <P>The health strategy, Better Health for Everyone, sets out a range of actions which are specifically directed at disadvantaged groups and are concerned with ensuring that these groups do not continue to suffer the most ill-health. Actions to reduce inequality include the implementation of <Col N="210" /> the National Anti-Poverty Strategy and targets for the reduction of health inequalities. These include targets for reducing gaps in premature mortality between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups. In addition, there are provisions to eliminate the barriers that exist for disadvantaged groups in terms of making healthier choices easier for these groups and supporting them at community level to understand and access services. There are also specific programmes of action for groups such as Travellers, the homeless, drug misusers, prisoners and asylum seekers and refugees, all of whom have a real risk of poor health status.</P>
    <P>The second national goal of the strategy is fair access. It is concerned with ensuring that equal access for equal need is a core value in the delivery of publicly funded health services. There are three strands to this goal. The first is to clarify eligibility through legislation and communication with hard-to-reach groups. The actions set out in the strategy will ensure that all those eligible understand their entitlements, can easily access services they need and can be sure that no matter where they live, there is a standard approach to their eligibility for services. As part of ensuring fair access the strategy identifies the need to provide equitable access to services. This is primarily concerned with improved access to hospital services for public patients. It also attempts to recognise other barriers which affect people's ability to access services.</P>
    <P>The strategy recognises that health for disadvantaged groups is a complex issue which needs to be tackled in a number of ways. We need to ensure, firstly, that people are healthier and therefore less likely to need health and personal social services and, secondly, that when they do &ndash; once they are deemed eligible &ndash; no other barriers such as transport or opening times prevent them from accessing the services they need. The Government has set out a range of measures to make more people eligible for services. Our commitment to their introduction is clearly stated in the strategy. The proposals are broadly aimed at the most vulnerable in society. Those on low incomes, especially families with children or a child with a disability, will be targeted. There is also provision for young children and the elderly. All of these groups have very high health care needs compared to the rest of the population.</P>
    <P>These proposals are a key element of the fairness part of the strategy. However, the strategy also recognises that extending eligibility will not guarantee that people get the services they need. There are other barriers to equity in the system and dealing with these has been prioritised to ensure the eligibility framework in the future can really support equal access for equal need. The Government is fully committed to extending medical card coverage to more people on low incomes and there will be targeted increases to ensure more children, in particular, are covered by these measures. Such actions always have to <Col N="211" /> be considered in the light of the whole range of priorities for the health services.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the developments this Government has been responsible for implementing during its term of office in the past five years. Since coming into office it has placed heavy emphasis on the development of new accident and emergency services. A total of 16 major capital investment projects have been initiated, catering both for new facilities and for extensive refurbishment and enhancement of existing facilities. Some 1.2 million patients are now seen annually at accident and emergency departments. Funding of &euro;7.3 million is being provided in 2002 to further these developments.</P>
    <P>It is worth reflecting for a moment on the waiting lists that existed when the Government came into office in 1997. At that point there was the equivalent of just &euro;10 million available to tackle waiting lists. My predecessor Deputy Cowen and I have increased this figure substantially each year and it now stands at almost &euro;44 million. Fine Gael showed with its recent national campaign that when its members do not like the waiting list figures they simply invent their own. The mass indifference which has greeted its campaign showed clearly that it is fooling no one. I recently released the hospital waiting list figures for December 2001. The total represents a decrease of 6,080 or about 19% since December 1997. These figures should be seen against the background of a hospital system which is continuing its high productivity. The total number of people treated last year as in-patients or day cases in acute hospitals was 920,000. Compared with the 786,000 people treated in 1997, this is an increase of 134,000 or 17%. This is the biggest ever increase in hospital activity in this country.</P>
    <P>This Government has ensured that more people are being treated and they are being treated more quickly. There is much more to do, but there has been progress. Some &euro;65 million is being provided in capital and revenue to meet the requirements of the first phase of a programme to provide a total of 3,000 new acute beds in the next ten years. Our target in the health strategy was to increase acute beds by 650 in 2002 but I was able to announce plans for an additional 709 beds in the current year. I am confident that these additional beds will bring much needed relief to the acute hospital system. A sum of &euro;30 million is being provided in 2002 for the purchase of treatments for public patients. The treatments will be purchased either from private hospitals in Ireland or, if necessary, from abroad. I have appointed a person to head the team and consideration is being given to a number of options. This, together with the waiting list initiative and bed capacity funding, will ensure that significant improvement in access to acute hospital facilities can be achieved in 2002.</P>
    <P>This Government has allocated more than &euro;103 million to cancer services. Since 1997, 64 additional consultant posts have been created <Col N="212" /> including support staff. In recognition of the need to develop cancer services further, the National Health Strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of this year of a revised implementation plan for the National Cancer Strategy. This plan will be developed by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. I notice that Deputy Noonan has toured the country promising new services and new developments wherever he thinks they might help the Fine Gael patient to live a bit longer. I have no doubt that this will continue to fool no one.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from &euro;12.7 million in 1997 to an additional &euro;72.9 million in 2001. This has resulted in the approval of more than 1,300 additional staff for services for older people. From 1998 to 2001 more than 550 additional beds were provided in new community nursing units and more than 1,250 day places per week have been provided in new day care centres. This year alone, additional funding of &euro;87.8 million is being made available for further development of the services.</P>
    <P>While it likes to posture on this issue, I never hear the Opposition defending its record on disability services. We have no problem defending a record which is delivering the largest ever expansion in services. Additional revenue and capital funding has provided around 840 new residential places, 296 new respite places and more than 1,500 new day places in addition to the enhancement of other services. We have provided additional funding for physical and sensory disability services &ndash; capital and non-capital &ndash; of more than &euro;175 million since coming into office. Additional developments in the period from 1997 to 2001 include more than 550 care places and 125 therapy posts. By any yardstick it must be acknowledged that in the last three years of this Government there has been a huge change in the level of funding for people with disabilities. It has been unprecedented. We readily acknowledge that there is some distance to go to meet all of the needs identified in the Intellectual Disability Database. We are currently developing the physical and sensory disability database which will give us a clear and objective picture of needs against which we can allocate sufficient resources to meet them.</P>
    <P>We will not pretend the agenda is complete or adopt the complacent approach which characterised health policy when Deputies Noonan and Quinn were making the decisions. We have no problem defending our record. We are targeting investment, increasing services, developing new approaches, hiring new professionals and delivering in the acute, primary and continuing care areas. We have produced the most ambitious and comprehensive strategy for investment and reform in the history of our health services and are funding and implementing that strategy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" />I am very pleased to reject the Opposition's typically superficial attack and look forward to putting our record before the people.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Gilmore.</P>
      <P>This Government came to office on the very simplistic promise of reducing taxes. What it did not tell people was that it was going to cut taxes in the capital area and slash taxes for the better off. It did not inform the public of the other side of that coin, namely that public services would be diminished and would not be able to meet modern day standards and expectations.</P>
      <P>There has been much concentration on health in this debate. It is rather pathetic that the best the Minister for Health and Children can do is talk about the blueprint he is drawing up for the next five years. With the health services in a shambles after five years in office, it is a pretty poor record. I wish to address issues in the area of education. It is interesting that the current Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had responsibility for both areas during the past five years.</P>
      <P>The image of modern and dynamic Ireland, as presented by the Government, rarely features any footage of the condition of many of our schools. It is difficult to believe that outdoor toilets, leaking roofs and sub-standard prefabricated classrooms remain a daily reality for pupils. It is hard to accept that an Ireland which has been fortunate enough to enjoy the riches of the fastest growing economy in Europe allows its young people to be educated in schools with no budget for repairing broken windows or providing basic hand-washing facilities. The reality, however, is that conditions associated with early 20th century Ireland have been allowed to prevail in schools. Their persistence is an indictment of a Government prepared to spend the nation's surpluses on the whims of Ministers rather than on the needs of school children.</P>
      <P>A recent INTO survey of primary schools found that many schools remain vermin infested, over-crowded and totally inadequate in terms of basic hygiene. Exactly 50% of schools lack facilities for pupils with special needs. It is quite ironic that the Minister for Education and Science is this evening in the Seanad trying to ram through the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002 to provide for the needs of people with disabilities and is doing so in a school building setting which is an absolute mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only 24% of schools are lucky enough to be able to afford a small library. More than 62% of primary schools operate daily without a principal's office from which to organise the school's business. There are currently 850 applications for major building projects before the Department of Education and Science. It is deplorable that so many school buildings and facilities have been neglected at a time when we have had such strong economic growth. The situation has been worsened further by a complete lack of transparency <Col N="214" /> on the part of the Government which has failed to disclose which schools are priority cases. The consequence has been a tremendous amount of frustration for principals, teachers and parents in urban and rural Ireland. Schools are justifiably angry when they hear of other schools receiving money for repair work while their claim appears to wallow in a backlog of similar claims.</P>
    <P>The Minister, despite having given a number of undertakings to publish the list of sub-standard school buildings has, to date, refused to do so. Clearly he has two objectives in mind. He is trying to hold on until as late as possible before the election to give the good news to those schools who will receive the go-ahead. The other reason is that many schools on the list will be disappointed because there is not enough money available this year to carry out essential works. He does not want to be up-front and straight with schools by telling them exactly where they stand.</P>
    <P>Another area which has been severely neglected by this Government is literacy. One of the most fundamental obstacles to eradicating educational disadvantage are the high levels of illiteracy which continue to plague so many of our communities. If ever evidence of that were needed, it is contained in yesterday's report on access to third level education. Despite the great number of very wealthy areas in Dublin, it is at the bottom of the list with only 38% of students going on to third level education. There is also a huge variation in participation rates within the Dublin area. We go from areas in parts of the Minister's constituency and close by in south Dublin where there is a participation rate in excess of 78% to areas like west Dublin and north Dublin where the participation rates are less than 10%. Less than 10% of our young people in certain communities are proceeding to any form of third level education. If that is not a serious indictment of the waste of Government resources over the past five years, I do not know what is. Few children in working class communities in Dublin, in particular, remain in education to junior certificate level let alone leaving certificate level. What chance is there of them ever going on to third level education? There has been no targeting of resources in relation to educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>This Minister, like his predecessor, has taken the political approach to spending in education by spreading everything around. Spending never takes place on the basis of priority resulting in few, if any, targeted measures to tackle the problem of educational disadvantage. Ireland's record on illiteracy reveals a particularly miserable performance. A recent assessment of English reading found there had been no improvement in reading skills among Irish school children in the past 20 years. Many students experience serious difficulties in literacy and more than 20% function at least two years behind their chronological age. We have not seen any targeted measure over the past five years to combat illiteracy among school children. That 20% is not spread around the country; it is concentrated in disadvantaged areas <Col N="215" /> where between 50% and 60% of children have serious literacy problems.</P>
    <P>Clearly this Government has no interest in those disadvantaged areas because no initiatives have been taken to tackle the problems. We also have major problems in the area of adult literacy. We hear much about the introduction of initiatives to bring people into the workforce but if people find it impossible to read even the most basic instructions, what chance have they of ever getting into employment? These are two of a number of areas that have been neglected over the past five years. No attention has been given to the area of pre-school education. There are now fewer State funded pre-school places than there were in 1997.</P>
    <P>How can Deputy Martin, as the Minister for Health and Children, not be ashamed of his Government's deplorable and pathetic record on funding for schools? Surely the State should be meeting the full running costs of our primary and second level schools in this day and age. We should be paying the full wage costs of the essential staff needed in schools. The Government never kept its election promise &ndash; to restore the pupil-teacher ratio in relation to career guidance counsellors. It has forgotten about that and has only managed to appoint a miserable 50 additional career guidance counsellors during its term of office. The Government has also failed to make a significant difference in regard to third level grants. Is it any wonder 40% of third level pupils drop out? The performance of the Government in regard to education over the past five years has been deplorable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this motion, which deals with the Government's performance. I was intrigued by the Minister for Health and Children's comment that he is looking forward to facing the people on the Government's record. When the Government faces the people and the Minister is defending his record, they will have a number of questions. How could Ireland have become the eighth richest country in Europe by 2000 but the second worst provider in terms of social protection? They will ask how we could have generated such massive surpluses one year after another and still experience the conditions that prevail in accident and emergency wards and in hundreds of schools, which are in a deplorable state and do not meet even basic health and safety standards. How could we, above all else, have arrived at a position where a new generation of young people may not look forward to purchasing their own homes without entering a form of slavery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will also be pushed to answer other questions. Ministers, in the dying days of their terms of office, will give us long lists of expenditure but the real test is what percentage of GDP was spent on health and the other indicators of social protection. The argument is that, politically, the Government claims credit when <Col N="216" /> the economy is doing well, sometimes for reasons over which it has little control. However, when economic growth slows or a deficit appears for the first time, it is not the Government's fault at all. The Government manages the good news and is never responsible for the bad news.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing those who have destroyed Ireland as I knew it have a vested interest in supporting the outgoing Government. Those who wanted to make a speculative profit out of the housing market, for example, have a loyalty to the Government. One report that was published highlighted that speculation in housing was making it impossible to provide houses for people who simply needed shelter but another report stated housing output could not be managed unless speculators were allowed back into the market in the classical Fianna Fáil way. Back in they came and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, went on television to say he was pleased he was a right of centre Minister and provided capital gains tax remission on speculative profits. Shame and disgrace on him.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the Progressive Democrats Members, in preparing for the election, are saying &ldquo;Put us four Progressive Democrats back because we will be able to tame Fianna Fáil&rdquo;. The Minister for Finance said Fianna Fáil did not capitulate to the Progressive Democrats but he was really saying &ldquo;I am a PD in Fianna Fáil clothing myself&rdquo;. The reality is the housing crisis has torn the heart out of our society. The election will be about the kind of society that is the legacy of the Government. Is it, for example, acceptable that the average price for a house is &euro;187,000 when it was only &euro;87,000 five years ago? One does not need to be a rocket scientist or, as the Taoiseach puts it, one of those people who is very good with figures in the party, to take the cost of a house, subtract the increase in the cost of building materials and wages and examine what is left, which is the speculative gain.</P>
    <P>Young couples must get &euro;50,000 from their parents to put down as a deposit on their first house and both must work. They no longer have the choice to work at home. Both must start early in the morning and must provide child care if they have children. They must work all day, some in virtual offices as they adopt new technologies, and return home late at night. They have little time for participation in the community or interacting with friends. How is this to be measured? It is not measured, but economic performance is measured without considering the affect on people. The Fianna Fáil-PD version of the economy is one which is depopulated.</P>
    <P>People will ask how could the housing list double, how could conditions be so bad in accident and emergency departments and why do children still have to go to school in degrading conditions while the economy is doing so well. Does a civilised version of society require this? In other European countries such as France the working life, the working year and the working day are being reduced and compulsory paternity leave is <Col N="217" /> being extended. All of these initiatives use the economy to provide a version of society that is built on certain values.</P>
    <P>There was a time Fianna Fáil was not anti-State, anti-welfare or anti-collective provision. Are we to leave the provision of shelter to the market or are we to accept there are basic rights of citizenship such as health, education and housing, which should be provided collectively with a role for the State? That is the issue on which the public must make up its mind. I challenge the Ministers of State and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who was in the House earlier, to conduct a survey on home ownership. The reality is that of the housing finishes to which Deputy Dempsey referred recently, 25% involved holiday homes which were built at the cost of inflating the price of a site for rural dwellers who want to build houses. Of the remaining 75%, some investors own 12, 14 and up to 20 houses. They generate money from rents and re-invest it in the dozens of tax avoidance schemes that are available, and on the spiral goes.</P>
    <P>When one asks why the housing lists have doubled, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, refers to demography, the number of people who have returned to their native areas and the number of young people seeking housing. Even if that were true, is there not a case for local State action to establish land banks? What about the case against speculative and windfall profits on building land? That will never be to the fore when a Fianna Fáil-PD alliance is in power.</P>
    <P>The cabal that is the vanguard of a certain section of society engaged in speculative building has always known where to go. There is no confusion in their minds and they will be seen heading in the same direction again. I will be an old person before the likes of this Government says the right to housing will come before the right to speculate on building land. Is it right that a person can own 12 or 14 houses and contribute to spiralling rents? The equivalent of a rent of £500 in 1997 is £1,200 today. These are facts. Are we to live in a new kind of slavery in society while the economy we are told by the right of centre Minister for Finance is doing very well? Frankly, it is a tragedy that there have been huge surpluses of more than £1 billion every year, but now we are heading for a budget deficit while all the gaps must be filled.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will also answer why there was no action on the private rented sector. The report of the commission on the private rented sector has been published but why was legislation not introduced to protect tenants? Why are more people being evicted now than were evicted during the Land War? There was an opportunity during the years of surplus to work on the estates that were built in the 1950s and 1960s without adequate provision of recreational <Col N="218" /> facilities and so on. Why did we not refurbish them and improve the environment?</P>

      <P>Scoil Choca Naofa is a small school tucked in behind the Catholic church on the main street in Kilcock. Before the bypass was built, the Minister of State would have passed its door on his way to Mayo. The only entrance to the school is through the church. It was built in 1953 and it had five classrooms.</P>
      <P>All of the classrooms in the original school are only two thirds of the recommended size. The largest of the rooms is 23 square yards smaller than that size. There are four prefabs, with all except one being two thirds the recommended size. One ancient wooden specimen that has been there for years is packed with children. The average class size in the school is 30 when the recommended number is 20, with one class having 38 pupils. They are packed into the classrooms. Health and safety considerations are not being dealt with. There is no room for storage, the toilets are totally inadequate and they have never heard of a PE room.</P>
      <P>The people of Kilcock are quiet and slow to anger. When they saw the need to have the school upgraded, they applied through official routes and did not approach their public representatives. Eventually they were given sanction for the extension of the school in 2000. Since then not a word has been heard from the Department. The parents in Kilcock are growing angry. These reasonable people feel they were treated with contempt. They now find themselves on the INTO's list of the worst schools in Ireland. The teachers and the parents, however, are proud of the school. I visited it and it is a credit to them how they keep it painted and cleaned on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>Why has the Department not appointed the architectural team which is the next stage of the process? The Government has the money. The Tánaiste said in a statement that the Government has loads of money and that money belongs to the parents. Not only is money available, we are the eighth richest country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Government have other priorities? Do children's welfare and education not come before grandiose schemes like the Bertie Bowl? Does that come before basic educational facilities? Are tax breaks for multimillionaire sportspersons and building speculators more important <Col N="219" /> than providing facilities for our children? Is the payment of &euro;250 million to Government consultants more important? I demand that the Minister acts to appoint the architectural team to replace the seven classrooms in Kilcock, to get rid of the prefabs and provide the children and parents of the village with the basic educational facilities to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear about what the Department is doing elsewhere. I want to know when this school will proceed to the next stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Scoil Choca Naofa, Kilcock, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>At present, the school has a staffing level of a principal, nine mainstream classroom teachers, two shared remedial teachers, one learning support teacher and a shared resource teacher. The enrolment on 30 September 2001 was 270 pupils.</P>
      <P>The school's present facilities consist of six permanent classrooms, three prefabricated classrooms, a GP room and other ancillary accommodation. The school authorities applied to the Department of Education and Science for additional accommodation. The allocation for primary building in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, a record level of funding that demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools such as Scoil Choca Naofa under its expanded school building programme.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary building area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction. This has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. A proposed building project for Scoil Choca Naofa will proceed to architectural planning and to the preparation of tender documents as soon as possible under the expanded building programme. In the interim, to alleviate the overcrowding problem, the Department has approved the appointment of an architect to progress the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy the matter will be kept under review having regard to existing commitments and priorities in the primary building area. The Department of Education and Science is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at Scoil Choca Naofa and I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position in regard to the school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Sexual health issues are of major importance to the health and well-being of young people. The facts underline the seriousness of the <Col N="220" /> situation: some 70% of young people in Ireland have full sex before the age of 20, the proportion of teenagers having unprotected sex has increased by 30% between 1997 and 2000 and 46% of sexually active men and women with multiple partners do not use any form of contraception. Levels of sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, genital warts and HIV have increased dramatically. There continues to be a steady increase in the number of unplanned pregnancies. Perhaps the figure that really drives home the message is that GPs are now prescribing more than 250,000 morning after pills a year to young people.</P>
      <P>To give a figure from an area with which I am somewhat more familiar, the Southern Health Board region, the number of attendances in the Cork STD clinic increased by more than 600% from 1990 to 2000. In 1990 a total of 909 people visited the clinic, a figure which rose to 5,068 in 2000. If this trend were to continue at this rate, some 25,000 people would visit the clinic in the year 2010. This may be something of an exaggeration but it hammers home the message that we are facing a dramatic increase &ndash; many have called it an epidemic &ndash; in STDs.</P>
      <P>The seriousness of these diseases should not be underestimated. While genital warts, for example, may be inconvenient and painful to men, they can cause cervical cancer in women and diseases such as chlamydia can cause infertility in women and may also have further consequences. We know all too well the consequences of the spread of HIV. As policymakers and legislators, we are, therefore, facing a situation which has gone from bad to worse in recent years. While there have been some initiatives by the health boards, I have not detected anything on an annual basis or a response from the Government during the past five years.</P>
      <P>As a young Deputy, I feel it is my responsibility, in the dying days of the Government, to raise this issue and try to have it prioritised. A number of things could be done. For example, in the area of education an initiative, the Relationships and Sexuality Education curriculum, was taken, but it transpires that less than 40% of primary schools and less than 80% of secondary schools are estimated to have implemented it. It is a joke &ndash; not a funny one &ndash; that our efforts to provide information and education on sex and relationships to schools have, unfortunately, failed.</P>
      <P>We need to target parents, something not done to date, with information campaigns. The first thing we need to do is accept that young people are having intimate, unprotected sexual relationships. We should not be judgmental or take the view that young people should not have intimate sexual relationships but instead take a very responsible approach towards informing young people and their parents about the dangers of such relationships. This needs to be done proactively through a national well publicised campaign targeting both young people and parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" />I hope the Minister offers a reasonable and comprehensive response which sets out what has been done during the past five years. From what I have been told, very little has been done in this area as a result of which we have a dramatic increase in the number of STDs and a corresponding decrease in the health of young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. I am aware of the increasing numbers of sexually transmitted infections, STIs, in Ireland. I am informed by the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, the agency responsible for the collection of these statistics, that it has finalised the data for notified cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2000. The rising trend in STI notifications has continued in 2000 with an overall increase of 27% between 1999 and 2000. The number of cases increased by 86% between 1995 and 2000 and almost trebled between 1989 and 2000 and there has been a steady rise in notifications each year since 1994. Figures for HIV among the heterosexual category have also been increasing. Some of this increase may be attributed to improved reporting arrangements, particularly since the establishment of the NDSC in October 1998.</P>
      <P>The rises in sexually transmitted infections are likely to be associated with increased unsafe sexual behaviour, particularly among young heterosexuals and men who have sex with men, although the rise in some infections such as chlamydia may also reflect increased testing for this infection. In addition, improved acceptability of STI clinic services and greater public and professional awareness of certain STIs may have contributed to the increases in reported cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005, published in July 2000 by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, it is acknowledged that sexuality is an integral part of being human and healthy sexual relationships can contribute to an overall sense of well-being. A strategic aim of the National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005, is &ldquo;to promote safer sexual health and safer sexual practices among the population.&rdquo;  The health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children is involved in and supports a range of initiatives and interventions aimed at preventing and raising awareness of sexually transmitted infections. These include social, personal and health education which is being introduced in primary and post-primary schools in partnership with the Department of Education and Science and of which Relationships and Sexuality Education is an integral part and the national youth health programme which is being carried out in a partnership between the National Youth Council of Ireland, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children and the youth affairs section of the Department of Education and Science. Its aim is to provide a broad <Col N="222" /> based, flexible health promotion and education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in the non-formal education sector.</P>
    <P>In the context of this programme a training initiative called Too Hot to Handle, which addresses the issues of relationships, sexuality and sexual health with young people, is offered to youth workers and a national public awareness advertising campaign to promote sexual health is aimed at men and women in the 18 to 35 age group to increase awareness about safe sex and sexually transmitted infections. The overall goal is to increase safe sex practices and reduce the incidence of STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies among young people in Ireland. The campaign runs in third level colleges, places of entertainment such as pubs, clubs and discos as well as youth clubs.</P>
    <P>This national programme has been running for several years and a new and revised campaign is being developed by the health promotion unit which will include an increase in the number of venues targeted. Following on from phase one of the Think Twice campaign, the health promotion unit is working in co-operation with the Southern Health Board in developing awareness raising initiatives and is developing a public information booklet to promote positive sexual health.</P>
    <P>The aim of the booklet is to heighten awareness on such issues as pregnancy prevention, the effects of alcohol and drugs, STIs and safer sex. The health promotion unit also produces a range of awareness raising leaflets on STIs and safe sex practices which are available through health promotion departments in each health board. The health promotion unit also supports a wide range of local health board initiatives and interventions targeting specific at-risk groups such as the gay community and prostitutes which are aimed at lowering the incidence of HIV and STIs in these groups.</P>
    <P>The report of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, NASC, entitled AIDS Strategy 2000, was published in June 2001 and makes recommendations for dealing with HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections in the coming years. My Department, through the three sub-committees of NASC &ndash; education and prevention, surveillance, care and management &ndash; work to implement these recommendations, one of which is that research be carried out on the knowledge, attitudes and skills of young people in relation to sexual health and diseases. The education and prevention sub-committee will examine this recommendation with a view to progressing our knowledge of sexual attitudes and behaviours in modern Ireland. Health board services for STIs and HIV have been enhanced over the last number of years. There are now six consultants working in the area of HIV and STIs, one of whom was appointed in the last few months. Five of these are in Dublin and one in Cork. A further consultant will be appointed in the Western Health Board during this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" />Education and awareness are the most effective tools in the fight against STIs. Despite the information available however the increased incidence of all major sexually transmitted infections is obviously of serious concern. The main messages in education and awareness programmes are that abstaining from sex altogether is a certain way of avoiding STIs and that for sexually active people who are not in &ldquo;one faithful partner&rdquo; relationships that the use of a good quality new condom, correctly used, is the single most effective defence against HIV infection and transmission. My Department will continue to give priority to the issue of STIs and will work with the relevant agencies in developing appropriate responses in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Coveney has learned of the activity in the various Departments regarding this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.</P>
      <P>The Ursuline College, Sligo, roll number 65180T, currently has an enrolment of 670 students who are using facilities condemned by the Department as inadequate and inappropriate for 500 students in 1983. They cannot continue to function in this way for another year and I ask that this case be given priority status immediately. I would be grateful if the Minister would process this application promptly so that the design team may proceed to stages 5 and 6 immediately. The project has been with the Department since 1983, when the school first made a submission; the previous upgrading of the school occurred in 1932, when the community built five classrooms. A team of DES instructors did a feasibility study of the school and as a result they were to produce a master plan including facilities for a school of 500 pupils.</P>
      <P>This has gone on since 1983 but negotiations have also been ongoing from 1994 to the present, despite constant delays. In 2001, a stage 4 detailed design submission was sent to the Department. Despite letters and phone calls no written communication was received from the Department and the school is again being sidelined.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider this case. The school has 700 pupils and the points the Department raised are alarming. The application has been with the Department since the 1980s but in the meantime the classroom situation has deteriorated alarmingly. Parents, staff and students object to the conditions in some classrooms and are forced to use leaking, badly insulated and sub-standard rooms where electrical fittings are faulty. Toilet facilities are inadequate and prefabricated classrooms must also be used though their condition is deteriorating with every passing month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure the school's application proceeds to the next stage as it is in <Col N="224" /> dire need of accommodation. This was raised in a letter to the Minister on 17 February 2000, while on 20 May 2000 the board of management responded to the schedule of requirements and accommodation list issued with the February letter. As the level of information provided is now considerable and in compliance with the Department's education design team procedures for stage 4, it is time for the Minister to make a decision.</P>
    <P>This school is one of the main education providers in Sligo town. It has huge facilities and a fantastic history but it is alarming that its application dates back to 1983. Its enrolment is 670 yet it was condemned as inappropriate for 500 pupils in 1983. This has been a problem under several Governments but in the last five years there was unprecedented money in the economy. It is disappointing nothing was done and the school is totally frustrated with the Department. It has contacted the executive officer in the planning and building design unit but it is still waiting for a response or an indication as to when funding may be made available.</P>
    <P>Education facilities are paramount. In south Sligo a school is being built by a public-private partnership, one of four or five in the country, and it is disappointing that an initiative of that nature has not been used for this school. It is unfortunate that second level students must use inadequate facilities such as prefabricated classrooms and inadequate toilets. It does not enhance education in Sligo. The Ursuline College has a prestigious name throughout Ireland and I am disappointed to have to raise this issue at this level. The Minister of State knows the school and I appeal to him to ask his Department to give a clear indication of the level of funding that is available and the timescale involved so that building can commence at the Ursuline College.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science proposals in relation to the proposed works at the Ursuline College, Sligo.</P>
      <P>The Department has received an application for additional accommodation from the school authorities. The planning section of the Department has agreed a long-term enrolment projection of 700 pupils with the school management authority. On this basis overall development of the school to provide additional accommodation was planned. Schedules of accommodation setting out the use of the space to be provided were agreed between the school management authority and the Department. These schedules form an integral part of the basis of the brief to the design team engaged to plan the project architecturally. During the planning stage of the project the Department's area norms increased and the schedule of residual accommodation was accordingly amended. The extension will now provide additional accommodation of 1,789m².</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" />A full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the project is progressing.</P>
    <P>The project at Ursuline College is at revised stage 4, detail design. The design team's revised submission has been received in the Department and is currently being examined. When the revised stage 4 submission is found to be satisfactory, the school authorities will be authorised to proceed as soon as possible under the expanded building programme to the neat stage of architectural planning, stage 5, bill of quantities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the schools building programme at all levels. The allocation for post-primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;182.31 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in post-primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
    <P>Because of the greatly increased level of investment in post-primary buildings since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. It is not yet possible to say when the construction phase of this project will commence.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to respond in the House.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to raise this issue but I am disappointed that neither the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources nor the Minister for Finance are present. They will have the opportunity to read what I say and I will pursue them on it later. When I was elected to the Dáil in 1996, I asked myself how we could call Ireland an island nation, as we were not prepared to invest in marine infrastructure. As an Opposition Deputy, I implored the then Government to increase investment, but to no avail. I am glad to say that things have changed since Fianna Fáil entered Government in 1997. In the past five years, &euro;67,868,000 has been allocated by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources for coastal protection, fishery harbours, commercial harbours, afforestation, peat development, sea processing, fishery development initiatives, ice plant infrastructure, aquaculture development, coastguard fishery development under INTERREG II and inland fisheries in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became a member of Donegal County Council seven years ago, I stood near Carrickrory Harbour and observed a pier which had fallen into the sea. I was told it could not be repaired as only £50,000 had been allocated for all the piers and harbours in the county. Major works are now under way, however, in Bunnagee, <Col N="226" /> Buncrana, Carrickrory, Greencastle, Inch, Lag, Leenan, Moville, Portleen, Portmore and Portronan and many other developments have been commenced. A car ferry will soon travel between Rathmullan and Buncrana and another will be provided to serve the route between Magilligan Point and Greencastle as a result of my lobbying. I am delighted with the amount of money which has been invested in the National Fishery Training College and the emergency services. I welcomed the marine seminar in Donegal which examined job opportunities.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise an issue of equal importance with which I am not so satisfied. I ask that the successful boats under the fishing fleet development initiative be announced. The initiative was commenced under the national development plan and Bord Iascaigh Mhara has advanced it to the stage where we should soon be in a position to announce successful applicants. I wish to declare an interest by pointing out that at least ten voters in my immediate area of County Donegal have made applications under the scheme and I hope they will be successful. A total of 38 applications were made in County Donegal &ndash; 22 in inshore and 16 bigger boats. The boats are getting more expensive by the day as they remain on the waiting list for sanctioning. The delay in announcing the successful applications means that it will become more and more difficult to hold boat builders to contracts, as quotes that were made some time ago may be revised or reviewed.</P>
    <P>Inshore fishermen have had many problems in the recent past and it has been a poor year in many respects for them. That there were so many applications under this scheme shows it has been as good a success as the whitefish renewal scheme, for which fishermen in Greencastle fought for many years and which was ignored until this Government came to power in 1997. The problem with the whitefish renewal scheme at the time was that it was oversubscribed; there was an overuse of initiative by fishermen. We overcame such difficulties and succeeded in getting extra money and boats and there are now six boats in Greencastle and 16 in Donegal. I presume there will be more approvals and more money, which is great from a marine perspective, but it is a shame that they have not yet been announced. The Minister for Finance should see this as a golden opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers' decision last December to allow fishermen to fish under derogation represents a wonderful chance for us to expand our fleet. The date of 17 June is looming and if we do not move on this scheme, the opportunity will be lost forever. Europe is prepared to give us the majority of the money in State aid and the Exchequer will have to provide only &euro;1.9 million, although I am open to correction on that. A small amount of money from national funding would lead to much more from Europe. Many people have decided to put their money where their mouth is and apply for new boats. We should encourage people to invest in safer boats. <Col N="227" /> Our boat building industry would also benefit, for example in Greencastle where there is a renowned facility. Jobs are very important in my part of the world and we should support them where possible. If we reward those who show initiative now, they will respond in kind. This fisheries fleet development measure is potentially as successful as the whitefish renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a future for our island nation. Having done so much for commercial fishermen and the emergency services in the past five years, including the rescue co-ordination centre in Malin Head, we should not step back at this stage. Money is being provided for marinas on the Foyle and the Swilly. The fishing fleet development initiative deserves extra funds. A small investment will lead to much more funds from Europe. The individuals who have applied should be rewarded. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to raise this matter with the Minister for Finance to ensure jobs are created in boat construction. No more time should be wasted in announcing the successful applicants if we are to ensure they do not become more expensive. We must not have further delays which may threaten the existence of this scheme, which is too important an opportunity to miss. An additional 38 boats in the fleet would be invaluable to the coastal community of Donegal. I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Chair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to inform the House of the progress of the Government's whitefish fleet development programme, which forms part of the national development plan. The programme is designed to promote investment of &euro;695 million in Ireland's whitefish fleet and is supported, over its lifetime, by Government and EU grant aid of almost &euro;27 million. The core objectives of the initiative, which is administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, are to enhance the safety, quality and competitiveness of the whitefish fleet and to improve working conditions, product handling and quality. The programme provides grant support for the introduction of new vessels and modern second-hand vessels, for the modernisation of existing vessels and for the purchase and installation of safety equipment. Special assistance is available for young fishermen and women acquiring their first vessel. The initiative will build on the success of the Government's &euro;100 million whitefish fleet renewal programme, under which 33 new vessels <Col N="228" /> and 11 second-hand vessels entered the fleet, approvals for safety and lifesaving equipment grants were given for the benefit of 600 vessels and 299 vessels were modernised.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Fahey, was pleased to announce the first round of approvals under the safety equipment scheme, involving an investment of &euro;400,000 to fit almost 750 items of vital lifesaving, firefighting and safety equipment on 36 vessels. Further applications under the safety equipment scheme have been received and are being assessed by BIM. Applications for the modernisation of existing vessels have been assessed by the board. Following examination of the proposed timescale for completion of these projects and the annual funding profile of the national development plan, the Minister expects to announce the approval of successful applicants soon. Applications for grant aid for the introduction of new and modern second-hand vessels and under the special scheme for young fishermen and women acquiring their first vessel are being processed. The timescale for assessment and processing of applications is in line with profiled expenditure under the national development plan.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to definitively quantify the final number of new or secondhand vessels which will be assisted under the programme as this critically depends on the level of applications for all schemes over the programme and the available funding. As the Deputy will appreciate, the programme in relation to vessel introduction schemes has attracted a larger number of applications than anticipated and is essentially oversubscribed. In this situation, careful consideration of the applications as regards the eligibility and ranking criteria is a vital part of the assessment process. It is also essential to ensure that the completion dates for projects involving significant capital expenditure on the part of applicants and which, consequently, are grant aid intensive, are aligned with the funding profile of the programme under the NDP.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Minister contacted the Minister for Finance and his officials have opened discussion with the Department of Finance in relation to aligning the proposed roll out of projects with the funding profile for the NDP for each of the years over the lifetime of the programme. The Minister assures the house of his commitment and that of the Department and BIM to delivering on the core competitiveness, efficiency and safety objectives of the Government's fleet development measure.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 March 2002.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that adequate safety standards at sea prevail, with particular reference to seaworthiness of vessels, the availability of suitably trained crews and the application of updated EU standards in relation to safety at sea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9819/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Safety standards for seagoing passenger and cargo vessels are developed and adopted at international level, principally from the safety conventions of the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, and from initiatives at European Union level. My Department participates in the relevant IMO and EU committees, which develop new standards and legislation, and continually updates our maritime law to ensure that all the resulting EU directives and IMO safety conventions and resolutions are fully implemented.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of all regulations is carried out by the technical staff attached to the newly established maritime safety directorate of my Department. They inspect vessels to ensure that they are complying with the safety standards laid down. I recently obtained Department of Finance sanction for the recruitment of ten additional vessels surveyors and three radio surveyors to ensure that we will be in a position to enhance our survey and inspection capability. These new staff will be taking up their duties shortly.</P>
      <P>Under Irish and international law all vessels trading into and out of Irish ports are required to carry the appropriate certification to demonstrate compliance with the requisite international conventions and regulations applicable to ships of their size and type. All vessels are subject to surveys and inspections by their flag states and, under the European Union's port state control system, all vessels using community ports are liable to inspections by any of the EU States they are visiting. The application of port state control ensures that at any given time a large number of ships operating within the area covered by the port state control system have undergone an inspection by an EU port state control authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's surveyors assign priority to foreign registered vessels which have had adverse inspections elsewhere or which fall into certain targeted categories. When any such vessels are found to be deficient, they are detained until the deficiencies are rectified. During 2001 my <Col N="230" /> Department's surveyors inspected 281 foreign vessels under the port state control system. Of these, 17 vessels were detained for non-compliance with the requisite international marine safety conventions.</P>
    <P>Irish registered vessels are inspected at least annually by my Department's surveyors and, in accordance with the port state control system, are liable to inspections every six months at the ports of other states that are members of the port state control system. There were 56 inspections carried out last year on Irish registered vessels under this system. Of these, no vessels were detained for non-compliance with the requisite international marine safety conventions.</P>
    <P>The international conventions covered by these inspections include the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers  &ndash; the STCW Convention &ndash; which relates to the certification standards which apply to the crews of the vessels. All crew on board the vessels must have proper certification to ensure that they are suitably trained and can adequately and safely discharge the duties of the positions they hold.</P>
    <P>Following the sinking of the Maltese registered oil tanker <i>ERIKA</i> off the French coast in December 1999, causing serious pollution damage, the European Commission produced a communication in March 2000 setting out a package of proposed measures to improve the safety of the seaborne oil trade. The measures include proposed amendments to the port state control directive to provide for better targeting of ships for inspection and to provide for refusal of access to community ports of manifestly substandard ships. A second package of measures proposed by the Commission comprising a directive establishing a community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and a regulation establishing a European maritime safety agency were agreed by EU Ministers last December.</P>
    <P>I am fully supportive of the need for these enhanced protection measures for maritime safety and the marine environment and will ensure that they are speedily transposed into Irish law when they are adopted. The monitoring of ships, by regular inspections is proving to be an effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards and that the vast majority of vessels operating into and out of Irish ports are complying with international convention requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 71 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>Poaching is a deeply anti-social activity which has no place in the wild salmon sector which I wish to see developed on the basis of an excellent recreational activity and on the basis of a high quality food product in which consumers can have confidence.</P>
      <P>My purpose in convening the top level meeting attended by senior gardaí and the fisheries boards' chief executives was to intensify in a targeted way the enforcement of fisheries legislation with particular attention on those areas where poaching is carried out by gangs prepared to use violence against the servants of the State. The meeting was an opportunity to review, in particular, the operation of the wild salmon tagging scheme and its role in stamping out poaching and the trade in illegally caught salmon. It was agreed that the Garda Síochána and the fisheries boards will target areas with high levels of illegal fishing through increased co-operation, intelligence gathering, information exchange and mutual support. This co-operation will take place at the local levels in the regions and at senior headquarters levels between the two law enforcement agencies.</P>
      <P>My intention is that this concentrated and sustained campaign will see an end to poaching which is depleting the salmon resource and damaging the social and economic life of local communities. I stress that it is an offence to be in possession of, or trade in, an untagged salmon and that the salmon tagging regulations specifically provide for the legal obligations on persons operating hotels, restaurants and other catering establishments.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 29 of 6 February 2002 in which I stated that I have requested the Central Fisheries Board to review the salmon protection programme in advance of this year's peak fishing season. When I am informed of the results of this review I will consider any proposed changes or improvements to the protection regime.</P>

      <P>A sum of &euro;2 million has been invested since 1998 to date in capital maintenance and safety works at Dunmore East. The interim board which I established last year, and which represents the fishing and marine leisure interests at Dunmore East, is working with my Department to enhance management and operations at the harbour centre and to agree the overall strategic direction going forward.</P>
      <P>I have indicated my support in principle for capital investment to develop Dunmore East on a value for money basis as a strategic centre for the seafood and marine tourism and leisure sectors. Future investment decisions will also have to take into account the development needs of other key fishery harbours in the south east region, including Kilmore Quay.</P>
      <P>A range of development options between &euro;14 million and &euro;24 million have already been proposed for Dunmore East in the strategic infrastructural review completed in 2000. In light of the emerging funding constraints under the NDP fishery harbour capital programme and in line with the Government's overall strategy to encourage public private partnership, I have asked my Department to examine and recommend on the scope for a PPP approach to future investment at Dunmore East. The potential for PPP will be strictly evaluated in terms of achieving value for money in line with Department of Finance guidelines on PPP projects. The cost benefit of any such investment for the Exchequer, for Dunmore East and the south east region generally will also have to be rigorously assessed. Subject to the outcome of the analysis of PPP potential and recommendations arising, it would be intended to put proposals to the Government on future investment strategies for Dunmore East.</P>

      <P>I had very useful and comprehensive discussions with my Spanish colleague in Madrid on 20 February. This meeting was a timely opportunity to review with the Spanish Presidency the current EU fisheries agenda. The key issues include the review of the Common Fisheries Policy, technical conservation measures, fleet policy, management measures for deep-sea species, and recovery programmes for cod and <Col N="233" /> hake stocks. We agreed to encourage enhanced liaison between Spain and Ireland on fisheries matters including co-operation on fisheries control.</P>
      <P>I outlined the Irish perspective on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. We confirmed our shared view that the Commission's Green Paper did not take adequate account of the socio-economic dimensions of fisheries policy and that CFP reform must address the interests of fishermen and the coastal regions which depend on fisheries. In that context we agreed that the strategic alliance on common themes with our French, Italian, Portuguese and Greek colleagues should continue to press the case for a genuine social chapter in the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>We also recorded common ground in relation to the long-term cod and hake stocks recovery programmes where we agreed that the Commission's proposals are not sufficiently well-developed. We agreed on the need to develop closer contacts between Irish and Spanish fishermen. In order to foster greater dialogue and co-operation between Irish and Spanish fishermen we intend to develop a programme of industry exchange visits, beginning with a visit to Spain by the fishing industry within the next few months.</P>

The total cost of the multi-annual project is estimated at &euro;4.9 million and would involve strengthening the sea wall and the phased construction of a series of groynes. Youghal Town Council received funding support in 2001 towards the preparation of tender and planning documents.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" />As I advised the House in my earlier reply, I am giving priority to new conservation and management initiatives for the in-shore fisheries resource. The new in-shore licensing scheme was designed to ensure the participation by all in-shore fishermen in the new management framework by regularising the status of those still operating outside the legal system. In response to expressed concerns about the cost of purchasing replacement capacity I have decided to revisit the scheme and to seek the agreement of the Commission to an amended scheme which would involve concessions on replacement capacity, possibly within the framework of a stand alone in-shore fisheries segment.</P>
    <P>My Department is also reviewing models in other member states which will inform our discussions with the Commission which I expect to take place shortly. I expect shortly to quantify the total amount of tonnage and kilowatts involved, following the closing date for applications under the original scheme which is tomorrow 28 March. In my discussions with the Commission I will also explore the scope for specific arrangements for very small traditional in-shore vessels, around the coast and on the islands.</P>
    <P>I draw Deputies' attention to the scheme which I have already introduced to encourage young fishermen to enter the industry. This scheme, administered by BIM, provides special financial support for fishermen under 35 years to acquire their first vessel. In addition to applying for grant aid, these young fishermen can avail of a special premium payment of 10% of the cost of a modern second hand vessel.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 128 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in 1998 Dublin Port Company applied for permission under section 10 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, as amended, to have 21 hectares of its own foreshore in Dublin Port reclaimed for port purposes. As the environmental impact statement, EIS, submitted with that application did not meet with minimum statutory requirements it was rejected by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Port Company submitted a new EIS to my Department on 8 March 2002 and they stated that it was their intention to enter a voluntary six month process of consultation with relevant <Col N="237" /> interested parties instead of the one month statutory requirement. We are endeavouring to have this clarified and have asked the company to advise us about the availability of the EIS to the public and when it will appear on their website. We await the company's response.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 160 on 20 March, my Department has forwarded the EIS to its consultants for examination to confirm that it meets statutory minimum requirements and constitutes a basis for me to make a decision on the application. The consultants will report in due course and I will then consider whether I can accept the EIS as adequate. The outcome of the public consultation will have to be thoroughly assessed before any decision could be made on the company's application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that following the decision taken last June by the promoters of the<i> Jeanie Johnston</i> project to postpone planning for a voyage in 2001, I set up a focus group, comprising the principal State and private stakeholders in the project, to identify the options for the future role of the project and to report to me on a long-term strategy for the vessel after completion. The focus group completed its work and presented its report to me in January this year.</P>
      <P>In its report, the focus group estimated that the final cost of the project will be &euro;14.35 million; it has overrun by more than &euro;10.16 million, or 377%, on its original estimate of approximately &euro;3.81 million and by more than 18 months on its originally scheduled completion date. The group also confirmed that the project to date has not delivered on any of its original objectives and the project promoters have been unable to develop credible plans for a US/Canada voyage, or for a long-term future for the vessel.</P>
      <P>The focus group concluded that there were serious deficiencies in the original concept in terms of its planned role and in the estimate of the benefits envisaged for the project for the future; that the project was inadequately managed and that the <i>Jeanie Johnston </i>company was not an appropriate platform for planning, designing or management of a future role for the project. In essence, the focus group has not identified a long-term use for the vessel, which will not involve the State in ongoing subvention to the project.</P>
      <P>Such were my concerns about the current financial state of the project highlighted in the report, that I brought the focus group report to the immediate attention of my Government colleagues. In doing so, I took the view that a structured winding down of the project, led by Kerry County Council, is the only practical way to avoid the forced disposal of the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> vessel and the promoting company being forcibly wound up. The Government agreed that in the event that Kerry County Council initiated a process leading to a voluntary liquidation of the project, all State agencies involved should co-operate in this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government decision, my Department has taken the lead in engaging all Government Departments and State agencies involved in this project in considering, as a matter of urgency, how best they can assist the council, within the framework of the terms and conditions attached to their grant allocations, in bringing about a satisfactory outcome for the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> project. As a result of this consultation, Kerry County Council has been able, within the last <Col N="239" /> week, to take the first steps towards implementing an initiative which will defuse the immediate financial crisis; allow the ship to be completed; ensure that the trade creditors can be paid in full; commence the winding-up of the Jeanie Johnston Company (Ireland) Limited in a manner which allows Kerry County Council take ownership of the vessel; and seek to agree with other State stakeholders on the future use of the vessel including its possible use as a visitor attraction in 2002.</P>
    <P>This initiative by Kerry County Council is essential in order to create space for considered reflection by State stakeholders on options for the future use of the vessel which would minimise the crystallisation of contingent liabilities. In particular, I am keen to see an outcome which avoids the need to recoup to the European Union, funds that have been allocated to the project under the tourism operational programme and Leader. In this regard, my Department will continue to support the council in their efforts to identify a way forward which avoids an unstructured dismantling of the project and secures a role for the vessel, which meets the objectives of the State stakeholders, including minimising their financial exposure.</P>

      <P>Investment in 2000 and 2001 under the marine and natural resources NDP schemes amounted to almost &euro;305 million representing 66% of targeted investment over that period. This reflects significant progress when account is taken of the delays in finalising the operational programmes and programme complements, the impact of the foot and mouth disease outbreak and delays in obtaining EU State aid approval.</P>
      <P>Under the NDP &euro;916 million has been provided for forestry of which &euro;688 million is co-funded under the CAP rural development fund. A further &euro;228 million has been provided under the regional operational programmes and the productive sector programme to improve existing woodlands, develop urban and amenity woodlands, re-establish forest plantations and to generally enhance forest infrastructure. Total investment to the end of 2001 under NDP forestry schemes amounted to &euro;198 million, representing more than 80% of targeted investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of &euro;430 million is being invested in the seafood sector over the period of the plan. Investment to the end of 2001 in this sector included almost &euro;30 million in fishery harbours, &euro;2 million in seafood marketing and &euro;3.6 million in seafood <Col N="240" /> training. Coastal fishing communities will benefit from investment under schemes which have already been launched or which are scheduled to be launched in the near future. These include the &euro;127 million fleet modernisation and renewal programme, the &euro;87 million programme of investment in the development of seafood processing, the &euro;27 million fisheries innovation and sustainability scheme and the &euro;73 million programme of investment in the development of the aquaculture industry. I have recently announced the first tranche of projects under the fisheries innovation and sustainability scheme and the aquaculture development programme involving total investment of &euro;10 million and &euro;12 million respectively.</P>
    <P>Further investment to date of some &euro;69 million under the NDP has been made in marine RTDI, commercial ports and coast protection programmes. The EU recently granted State aid approval in respect of tourism measures under the NDP and I launched the NDP scheme for marine-based tourism and leisure scheme in early February this year. I expect to launch tourism and recreational angling measures in the near future.</P>

      <P>Under Irish and international law, all vessels trading into and out of Irish ports are required to carry appropriate certification to demonstrate compliance with the requisite conventions and regulations applicable to ships of their type and size. All vessels are subject to surveys and inspections initially by their flag states and, in addition, they are liable to inspection every six months under the port state control system if they visit any of the countries party to that system.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of port state control, the number of individual foreign vessels visiting Irish ports in 2001 was 1,330. A total of 281 such vessels were inspected by my Department's surveyors under the port state control system in 2001 and 17 of these vessels were detained for non-compliance with the requisite international marine safety conventions.</P>
      <P>Concerns have been expressed about the treatment of crews on vessels operating under flags of convenience. All merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are over 140 ship registers in operation world-wide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state.

      <Col N="242" />Ireland participates in IMO and ILO discussions on seafarers' welfare, supporting proposals aimed at improving their terms and conditions of employment. We will continue to press for the highest standards at international level relating to the employment of seafarers. Maritime safety standards will be further augmented this year with the implementation of two EU Council directives which deal respectively with the organisation of working time for seafarers and with the enforcement through inspections of provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work on board vessels calling at community ports.</P>

      <P>The position is that the European Commission has recently adopted its decision crediting the Irish pelagic segment with additional fleet capacity and effort to take account of additional fishing opportunities in Mauritanian waters. This step, in conjunction with arrangements to address the power over-capacity in the pelagic segment, has enabled the vessel concerned to be fully licensed and registered as part of the Irish and EU fishing fleet. I expect, therefore, that the infringement proceedings, which appear now to be redundant, will not be pursued by the European Commission.</P>

      <P>The current licensing terms introduced in 1992 were very carefully designed to compensate for Ireland's disadvantage in terms of perceived prospectivity and operating conditions and to encourage interest in exploration and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the criticisms of the terms by the national offshore committee of SIPTU but its criticism is not supported by the facts. Since the introduction of the 1992 licensing terms, 37 <Col N="245" /> exploration licences have been granted, of which 26 were frontier exploration licences. Out of those 37 licences, 29 have been relinquished, including 19 of the frontier licences, which means that there are now only eight offshore exploration licences in place compared to a peak of 32 in 1997.</P>
    <P>The stark reality is that Irish prospectivity is low and is not comparable with our oil producing neighbours. The Corrib gas find, although very welcome, cannot be regarded as changing that perception. Only four exploration wells have been drilled in the Irish offshore in the last three years, despite the existence of the 1992 terms. We have only had three successful exploration wells out of 125 wells in 30 years. Over the same period the United Kingdom has drilled about 3,000 wells of which about 250 are in production.</P>
    <P>In light of these factors, calls for a review of the 1992 licensing terms are premature and cannot be justified at this time. Any indication of our intention to do so would send the wrong signals to the industry at a time when we need to encourage the companies to increase the level of exploration. However, I intend to keep the terms under continuing review.</P>

      <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in pressing the European Union to take action to address this situation. Emergency stock recovery measures have been implemented for Irish Sea cod, northern hake and also the cod stock off the north west coast.

      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has recently published its report on water quality in Ireland from 1998 to 2000. In the case of rivers, the report shows a reversal in the trends of slight and moderate pollution and a slight reduction in serious pollution generally. Modest improvement in the water quality status of our lakes has also been noted. The report notes that it is felt that the wider range of catchment management techniques that have been implemented in the recent past may be responsible for this improvement.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged to note the improvements reported by the EPA. However, pollution remains the most serious threat to fish stocks. Under the National Development Plan, over &euro;3 billion has been provided for water and waste water treatment which is providing the essential infrastructure to deliver on the water quality objective.</P>

      <P>In relation to the reduction of container traffic from Dublin Port, my views on this issue are a matter of public record. It is essential that the feasibility be examined of locating a container storage facility for Dublin Port traffic on the periphery close to the M50, connected to the port preferably by rail with an operational capacity to work off-schedule. Late last year, without seeking to pre-empt the findings of the task force, I charged Dublin Port Company with responsibility to deliver on this initiative, either alone or in partnership with the private sector, with a view to significantly reducing container truck movements out of the centre of Dublin at peak times.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port Company have since advertised for consultants to examine the feasibility of establishing such a container storage facility close to the M50. The closing date for receipt of pre-qualification proposals was 18 January 2002. The responses are currently being evaluated by the company to produce a shortlist of companies who will be requested to submit detailed tenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that I recently launched the marine tourism submeasure which will be implemented by my Department as part of the two regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Under this grant scheme, &euro;25.4 million has been allocated to marine tourism and targeted particularly at improving marine access infrastructure such as marinas, berths and slipways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In developing its priorities for the national development plan my Department, in consultation with the Marine Institute, has identified the lack of an adequate coastal infrastructure provision as a key development constraint to water <Col N="251" /> based tourism and leisure and the most serious obstacle to development as being the lack of service infrastructure in coastal regions in terms of serviceable harbours, piers, slipways and moorings. As a result, the improvement of access infrastructure in coastal and estuarine areas has been targeted by my Department as the primary focus for development under the scheme. In pursuing this policy, it is intended that investment in infrastructure will concentrate on providing facilities in coastal areas which have suffered from under-investment in the past and have the potential to provide either new or enhanced recreational infrastructure to facilitate activities such as general boating, angling and water sports.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of this grant scheme, my Department provided funding of &euro;5.71 million for four flagship marina projects at Caherciveen, Kenmare, Roundstone and Rosses Point. I understand that the Caherciveen and Kenmare facilities will soon be completed while work on the other two projects should commence shortly. Following <Col N="252" /> on from the development of these new facilities, the investment programme which I have now introduced under the national development plan has the potential to realise the Government's vision of a necklace of high quality marinas around the coast and, in doing so, provide a comprehensive network of top class facilities, create hundreds of jobs and deliver economic benefits to virtually every coastal county in Ireland.</P>

    <P>Re Circular 4/2002, Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, the definition of special adviser under the Act is as follows: A Senior Special Adviser is a person who was appointed personally by an office holder and whose function or principal function, is to provide advice or other assistance to or for the office holder and whose remuneration is equal to or in excess of the maximum of the Higher Executive Officer &ldquo;standard&rdquo; payscale currently &euro;38,441.32.</P>
    <P>*Ms Evelyn Eager was initially appointed on 27 June 1997, but resigned from this post on 9 November 2000 and was then reinstated as listed.</P>
    <P>**Mr. Bobby Holland remains on the Department of Education and Science payroll at his existing salary, and this Department recoups the cost of a replacement teacher up to the maximum of the current HEO standard scale.</P>
    <P>***Payments not exceeding 11% of salary in respect of superannuation contributions are made on the individual's behalf to a recognised pension fund on foot of notification by them of their membership of that fund. These payments can, alternatively, be made to the individuals by way of reimbursement of their own contributions to the fund; reimbursement only takes place on foot of satisfactory documentary evidence which vouches for their contributions to the fund. Under this agreement they agree to waive all entitlements under any public service superannuation scheme in respect of the period of their appointment.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of community employment is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into employment in the open labour market. Participants on CE are usually within the age range of 25 to 65. A person who is on CE when he or she reaches the age of 65 may finish out his or her term and is not automatically terminated from the programme. The person who is on any FÁS programme on reaching the age 65 will have been <Col N="269" /> eligible due to the eligibility criteria at the time of applying and will remain on such a programme until the approved eligibility period elapses, even if such date brings them past 65 years. As advised by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, a person may continue to claim invalidity pension at 66 years of age or older and, therefore, there is no requirement to transfer to the old age pension at that time.</P>

      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents me or our Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk. Under the Equal Status Act, 2000, any individual who considers that he or she has experienced discrimination, within the meaning of the Act, may refer a complaint to the Director of Equality Investigations for investigation or mediation. Among the areas of potential discrimination are age or sex of an individual. I am concerned that persons in any particular age category might not be able to obtain travel insurance cover and I would encourage them to seek such cover from as many insurers as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on community employment are being mainstreamed. This process has already commenced in the case of CE services in schools and active discussions are under way between officials of my Department, the Department of Health and Children, the health boards and FÁS with a view to the mainstreaming of CE health services. The mainstreaming of such services will involve the phased transfer of current CE funding for these services to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the level of funding to transfer to the Department of Health and Children will be based on the number of current participants and supervisors working in dedicated health projects, which will be identified based on criteria drawn up by the health boards as suitable for mainstreaming in this current phase. Every effort will be made to ensure continuity of services during the handover process.</P>
      <P>Discussions to date regarding the mainstreaming of CE health services indicate that there are good prospects for supervisors currently employed by the sponsor organisations in the health sector to be retained by the sponsor organisation in a similar capacity following mainstreaming. However, it will be a matter for each organisation concerned to consider its particular needs and how best to deliver the service currently provided by CE under the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>In the overall context of restructuring, CE supervisors will not be retained on the programme in cases where projects are discontinuing and there is no alternative employment available or acceptable to the supervisor. FÁS employment service will, however, make every effort to ensure that supervisors are made aware of other employment opportunities, including those arising in the social economy, as this programme is rolled out, or in other CE schemes. FÁS employment service will initiate contact with supervisors who may become redundant and provide the full range of employment supports, including job placement or further training if required. In addition, FÁS will ensure that redundant supervisors, with their consent, are placed on the regional database of community employment supervisors for future prospective employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supervisors becoming redundant are entitled to statutory redundancy payments in accordance with the terms of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, and to minimum notice under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, as amended by the Worker Protection Act, 1991. The redundancy position in respect of the individual supervisor referred to in the question will be an operational matter for consider<Col N="271" /> ation by FÁS in consultation with the relevant sponsor.</P>
    <P>In August 2001 I announced new flexibility arrangements for the future operation of CE, which are of particular relevance for older workers. FÁS has discretion to extend, on a case by case basis, an individual's term on CE, having regard to his or her personal development needs and future employment prospects. I have no plans to increase the numbers remaining on the programme for extended periods beyond the new flexibility already introduced. As provided for under the PPF, an overall review of active labour market programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the near future under the aegis of the PPF standing committee on the labour market. The future policy direction of CE will be informed by the outcome of this process.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> if consideration has been given to introducing further legislation or measures to deal with the growing problem of unsolicited electronic mail, junk faxes and other inappropriate methods of direct marketing; the submissions received by her on the issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
      <QRef>[9787/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Communities (Protection of Consumers in Respect of Contracts Made by Means of Distance Communication) Regulations, 2001 (S.I. No. 207 of 2001), which I made last year, prohibit a supplier from enforcing a distance contract against a consumer if the contract is made by, amongst others, unsolicited commercial communications by electronic mail, UCE, unless there has been no clear objection from the consumer to this. The regulations also prohibit a supplier from enforcing a distance contract against a consumer where an automated calling system or a fax machine is used by the supplier unless the consumer has given his or her prior consent to this.</P>
      <P>Draft regulations to give effect to those provisions of the Electronic Commerce Directive (2000/31/EC) that were not transposed by the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000, are with the Attorney General for approval. These regulations will include provisions on UCE in line with Article 7 of the directive which requires member states which permit UCE to ensure that it is clearly identifiable as such as soon as it is received by the recipient. Article 7 also requires those sending UCE to consult regularly and respect opt out registers in which individuals not wishing to receive UCE can register their details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department issued a discussion document on the transposition of the electronic commerce directive in 2001. A large number of submissions were received, including comments on UCE. My <Col N="272" /> Department continues to have discussions with interested parties on issues relating to UCE, including the possibility of a code of practice to complement the regulations now in preparation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, will shortly be introducing regulations to transpose EU Directive 97/66/EC on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. The regulations will also prohibit unsolicited telephone calls or faxes for the purposes of direct marketing to subscribers who have indicated they do not wish to receive such communications. This option will be facilitated by the establishment of an appropriate national database to which subscribers can indicate such a choice.</P>
    <P>I understand the discussions on the draft EU directive on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector are also close to conclusion. The regulations to transpose that directive, which will be brought forward by the Minister for Public Enterprise, will also address unsolicited electronic mail, SMS text messages etc.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, where personal data are kept for the purpose of direct marketing and a data subject requests the user of the data to cease using it for that purpose, the user of the data must comply with that request. These provisions are to be strengthened in the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2002, which was recently published, by requiring direct marketers to get the prior approval of data subjects before using their personal data for direct marketing purposes.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the various measures outlined above is that there will be a comprehensive set of legal rights available to persons in relation to unwanted e-mail and other forms of unwanted communications. I add that dealing on a national basis with the problem of unwanted e-mails in particular is uniquely difficult given the global nature of the Internet and the technical difficulties involved in regulating the technology at national level. There is, therefore, a particular onus on individuals using the Internet and indeed on the industry supplying Internet services within Ireland to help deal with the issue. National legislation alone cannot do so.</P>

      <P>My Department has been reviewing how the operation of the <Col N="280" /> statutory redundancy scheme could be made simpler and more efficient. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU have developed proposals to enhance the levels of payments made under the scheme. I met with ICTU on 6 March last during which its proposals were outlined to me. I am currently consulting the other social partners, the employers, and I am bringing proposals to Government this week for a comprehensive review of the scheme by a group representing employers, unions and the relevant Departments.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the high rates of car insurance and the difficulties they create, particularly for young people. However, the pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and European Union law prevents me or our Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite.</P>
      <P>High rates of car insurance may present difficulties, particularly for some young people who might be considering buying a car for the purpose of transport to a place of employment. However, in many cases it may be possible for people to overcome those difficulties by availing of alternative means of transport or by making arrangements with colleagues to share available space in vehicles travelling to the particular location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question put by the Deputy on this issue in February, the Government, through the enterprise development agencies, is committed to ensuring an equitable distribution of job opportunities and encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. The Border, midlands and west region, in particular, is a priority area for employment promotion by the agencies concerned, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland continues to market the location for new inward investment and over the last number of years the county has received major new investment from overseas companies such as Masonite, MBNA and Eaton Automotive. The IDA is in the process of developing a new advance facility in Carrick-on-Shannon and this building will be used to assist in the marketing of the location. MBNA has now secured planning permission for a major expansion of its credit card operation in Carrick-on-Shannon and IDA Ireland is working closely with the company to secure significant new job opportunities for the area. In addition, IDA Ireland is working to develop the existing base of overseas companies in the region, strengthened through the recent regionalisation of its engineering and software staff to its office in Sligo.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is committed to supporting the development of new enterprises in County Leitrim and the agency's funding packages for expansions and start ups positively discriminate in favour of companies located in the BMW region. In recent years, Enterprise Ireland has been involved in facilitating the development of community enterprise centres in Mohill, Manorhamilton and Carrick-on-Shannon. Enterprise Ireland has facilitated clients to purchase industrial land from the IDA with a view to creating more enterprise space, including companies and groups in Carrick-on-Shannon, Rooskey, Ballinamore and Manorhamilton.</P>
      <P>Recent initiatives by Enterprise Ireland in the area include: a seminar on creating high potential businesses held in November 2001 in Sligo and attended by 60 people, including representatives from Leitrim; a campaign under the Are You an Imaginer title to attract potential entrepreneurs to the area last Christmas, continuing during 2002; a new seed and venture capital fund in partnership with Enterprise Equity; and, the establishment in 2001 of the cross-Border technology enterprise start up programme in partnership with LEDU and the IFI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the micro-enterprise measure of the BMW regional operational programme, 2000-06, the Leitrim County Enterprise Board provides support to micro-enterprises in County Leitrim through investment in assets, employment and feasibility studies, managerial training, enterprise <Col N="283" /> education and women in business initiatives. FÁS, the training and employment authority, offers support services to all workers made redundant and those already on the live register. All redundant workers are offered a FÁS quality registration interview, receive guidance and counselling and are encouraged to go forward for employment. In addition, long-term unemployed persons are engaged through the national employment action plan.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that persons of 17 years of age are unable to obtain motor insurance; the measures in place to protect young drivers and ensure that they receive motor insurance; her plans to review these procedures; and if she will make a statement on the matter in view of all the reviews. </Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by young persons in their efforts to obtain motor insurance. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and European Union law prevents me or our Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks insurance companies are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to young persons being unable to obtain motor insurance, the declined cases agreement between my Department and the authorised motor insurance companies offers the provision of a quotation subject to <i>inter alia</i> written evidence of five refusals of cover from motor <Col N="284" /> insurers. Under the Equal Status Act, 2000, any individual who considers that he or she has experienced discrimination, within the meaning of the Act, may refer a complaint to the Director of Equality Investigations for investigation or mediation. Among the areas of potential discrimination are age or sex of an individual.</P>
    <P>The work of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board has included an examination of the cost of motor insurance for young people. The board has finalised its report and arrangements for its printing and subsequent publication are now being made. I will give urgent consideration to the best way of advancing the MIAB's recommendations when I receive the final report.</P>

      <P>Arising from recommendations from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, my Department records details of all consultancy type projects since 2000 on an interdepartmental consultancy database. The following schedule sets out details of all such consultancies in respect of 2000 and 2001 as transcribed from the database. It also includes similar details in respect of 1997 to 1999. Consultancies that were not completed or were ongoing as at end 2001 are included. Where consultancies were not complete as at end 2001 and no payments had been made until then, the cost included is the estimated final cost of the consultancy.</P>

      <Quest> the number of times contact has been made with the out-of-office hours telephone service between immigration officers and the work permit section of her Department since its establishment in March 2001; the nature of any such contract; the number of people who were given permission to enter the country as a result of these contacts; the number of people who were disallowed entry as a result of these contacts; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not proved necessary to use this service on a very regular basis and at most it is used several times per month, generally when the immigration officers wish to satisfy themselves regarding a work permit holder or, in some cases, that an application has been made for a permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has no need to keep a log of such queries or, indeed, to know what might be the final outcome of such queries. It should be mentioned that any decision not to admit a person presenting themselves at a port of entry is a <Col N="291" /> matter for the relevant immigration officer. Information relating to work permit status might not be relevant or might be only one factor among several deemed relevant to such a decision.</P>

      <P>Work permit applications are processed on the basis of a correctly completed application form, receipt of the appropriate fee and compliance with the necessary visa requirements. Applications for permits on behalf of non-EAA doctors must also include medical validation (a certificate of registration with the Irish Medical Council).</P>
      <P>Applications in respect of medical personnel are exempt from FÁS requirements which have been mandatory since January 2002.</P>

      <P>In 1988, the co-operative development council and unit were established following a commitment in the Programme for National Recovery.</P>
      <P>In the context of the then prevailing high level of unemployment, the council and unit sought to, among other things: promote the co-operative concept, provide information and research in relation to co-operative development and provide advice and assistance, including financial supports to emerging co-operatives.</P>
      <P>With the vastly improved employment situation in recent times, there has been a decline in the demand for the services for which the council and unit was originally established. In recent years the unit has been focusing on a more limited role e.g. helping employees to take over a business in circumstances where the family owner has decided to cease involvement. This activity, while laudable in itself, is not strictly compatible with the priorities set by FÁS in its recently published statement of strategy 2002-2005.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Director General of FÁS has met with representatives of the social partners and conveyed this view to them. I further understand that they share the director general's approach in this matter, as I do. Discussions are ongoing on how the current activities of the council and unit might be supported through other more appropriate organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>At my request, senior IDA Ireland executives met with the management of the company. The first of two meetings was held on 8 March 2002. At that meeting, IDA requested that the management examine a number of alternative restructuring situations whereby the plant could continue to operate at its reduced level of capacity until the market position became clearer. These included submitting a long-term viability plan to IDA, reducing manning levels in the plant in line with existing production levels and selling off surplus assets, i.e. a land base of ten acres plus. This would provide the necessary funds to keep the operation going for the remainder of 2002.</P>
      <P>IDA met with the company again on 12 March 2002. The meeting was arranged to discuss the position, following an assessment by the company of the various options put forward by the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company decided that, if it brought manning levels into line with output of 25 tonnes, it would still make considerable losses due to the high fixed costs of running the operation. The company was also not prepared to sell off its land base to fund trading losses as this would dissipate <Col N="296" /> the asset base further, and affect payments to creditors.</P>
    <P>IDA understands that the management team have made considerable efforts to keep the plant operational in a particularly difficult trading environment, and that all the options have been examined. Unfortunately, all of these options have indicated that the plant will continue to incur substantial trading losses at existing output volumes. Given that the US market for the company's products continues to remain depressed, with no sign of an upturn, the plant cannot continue to operate in this uncertain environment.</P>
    <P>The IDA is not empowered to fund the trading losses of a company either under the Irish Industrial Development Acts or under EU State aid rules. IDA could only play a role in assisting the company if there was a restructuring plan that could clearly demonstrate a return to profitability and long-term commercial viability. Following on from the two meetings held with the company, it is IDA's understanding that the company would not be in a position to submit such a proposal.</P>

In so far as information is available to my Department, the following are details of solicitors or barristers appointed during that period.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board</i>The chairperson, Mr. Conor J. Maguire, SC, was appointed by the Government for a five year term, with effect from 30 June 1998. Given the quasi-judicial functions of the board, it was considered appropriate to appoint, as first chairperson, a senior barrister with wide experience.</P>
      <P>His fees were as follows: (per annum) to 31/12/00, &euro;3,809.21; from 1/1/01, &euro;7,618.43.</P>
      <P>Ms Berna Grist BL, was appointed as member and deputy chairperson of the board for an initial three year term, with effect from 30 June 1998. She was reappointed for a further year but resigned on 30 September 2001. While no particular legal qualification or experience was a requirement for the position, her extensive planning law expertise was considered to be a useful contribution to the board.</P>
      <P>Her fees were as follows: (per annum) to 31/12/00, &euro;2,539.48; from 1/1/01, &euro;5,078.95.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mining Board</i>Ms Nuala Butler, BL, was appointed as chairperson of the Mining Board from 24 December 1999 until 23 December 2002. Ms. Butler is paid &euro;7,618 per annum. Section 30 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, stipulates that a barrister be appointed to the position of chairperson of the Mining Board.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Ministerial Task Force on Port Estates</i>Mr. Ian Scott, solicitor, was appointed to the ministerial task force on port estates on 5 February 2001. No remuneration is paid in respect of this position. Legal qualifications and experience were a requirement.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Task Force on Dumping of Radioactive Materials</i>Ms Nuala Butler, BL, chaired the Task Force on Dumping of Radioactive Materials (Maritime Area) from 27 August 1997 to December 1999. The holding of particular legal qualifications or experience was not a requirement for the position and no remuneration was paid.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ms Sinead McSweeney, BL, was special adviser to my predecessor, Dr. Michael Woods from 3 July 1997 to 17 July 1998. She received a total remuneration of &euro;48,840.88 over this period. Legal qualifications and experience were not a requirement.</P>
      <P>My Department has also availed from time to time of professional legal services in connection with the preparation of legislation.</P>

      <P>A fishing boat register was established under the Merchant Shipping (Registry, Lettering and Numbering of Fishing Boats) Regulations 1989 (S.I. No. 344 of 1989), which required all existing fishing vessels to apply to be registered on the new register by 15 June 1990. The establishment of the register was widely publicised in the fishing industry and the media in 1989. Registered owners of fishing vessels were advised, in writing, that they were required to re-register their vessels. Only vessels that appear on this register are acceptable as replacement capacity. The current policy on fleet capacity provides that the capacity withdrawn from the fishing boat register when a fishing vessel is de-registered is retained in its entirety by the vessel owner. The vessel owner may sell this capacity to a third party or use it to licence and register a new vessel. There are currently no limits applied to the length of time this capacity may be held off the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 131 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 93 to 97, inclusive, on this subject on Wednesday, 6 February 2002. Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited declared the Corrib gas field commercial in January 2001 on behalf of its co-venturers, Statoil and Marathon. A petroleum lease demising the petroleum in the Corrib leasehold area issued to the Corrib group on 15 November 2001 and gave the conditions under which the lessees may work the petroleum, that is produce and market the gas. The granting of the lease does not in itself allow the company to commence development of the field, as under the terms of the lease, a plan of development accompanied by an environmental impact statement has to be submitted by the group for my approval before development can take place.</P>
      <P>A development plan accompanied by an environmental impact statement submitted by the group is being processed in my Department and I expect to make a decision on the matter soon. Enterprise Energy Ireland has plans to bring the gas ashore by October 2003 and expects the field to be in production for about 15 years. This is the first gas discovery to be developed off the west coast and the second large independent development in Ireland since the development plan for the Kinsale field was approved about 25 years ago. Its reserves are estimated at more than half those of the Kinsale and Ballycottton fields.</P>
      <P>Ireland's future energy requirements are a matter for Deputy O'Rourke, the Minister for Public Enterprise. However, Ireland has no reserves of oil and all its oil requirements are imported. About 18% of the national gas requirement is met by production from the Kinsale Head gas field and the remaining 82% is imported through the interconnector. These figures reflect the decline in production from Kinsale since 1995-96 when it met 83% of the national requirement. It is expected that the share of the national requirement supplied by indigenous gas will increase when the Corrib field comes into production.</P>

      <P>The Marine Institute and inter<Col N="306" /> national scientific bodies carry out annual assessments of EU fish stocks. On the basis of the most recent advice, there is a serious concern that many stocks appear to be outside biological limits. There is particular concern about a number of key whitefish stocks, such as cod and hake. The European Commission, with the support of Ireland, has put in place emergency stock recovery plans for Irish Sea cod, northern hake and cod on the north west coast. It is too early to evaluate the results of these initiatives. Recent Commission proposals for a long-term recovery plan for the stocks are being examined. The stock assessment book, published by the Marine Institute, outlines the current status of the fish stocks of interest to Ireland. I have arranged for it to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

In addition, the sea fisheries control division of my Department carries out port based controls on landings into Ireland. I continue to press at EU level for the effective enforcement of fisheries regulations in an even-handed manner by all member states. The viability of the resource and the interests of fishermen depend on the compliance with the rules of all vessels fishing in EU waters irrespective of origin.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national climate change strategy identifies the key role to be played by forestry in meeting Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and sets a target for forests to contribute 6% to <Col N="307" /> the proposed reductions in emissions through an intensification of the afforestation programme. While it is difficult to forecast planting levels at this early stage of the year, it is anticipated that planting levels for 2002 may be in the order of 18,000 hectares. In the context of carbon sequestration, conifers including sitka spruce and western red cedar are particularly well suited. It is estimated that, on average, one hectare of sitka spruce absorbs 3.3 tonnes of carbon per year. Over its rotation, one hectare of conifers will remove approximately 100 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere, making conifers exceptionally efficient in combating the greenhouse gas effect. With regard to the suitability of particular species, soil and site determine the rate of forest growth and consequently the potential for carbon storage. COFORD, the Council for Forest Research and Development, is carrying out extensive work in the area of carbon sequestration with a view to maximising the sequestration potential of Irish forests. A research and development contract has been negotiated which will refine current estimates of carbon stocks in the Irish forest estate. The results of this research will inform future forestry policy.</P>

    <P>In September 2000 the Government decided that Ireland would reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for expenditure on ODA by the end of 2007. Achievement of this target will require further annual increases in ODA. Current projec<Col N="309" /> tions suggest that GNP will rise as follows between now and 2007:</P>

    <P>This suggests that the total ODA budget will amount to almost &euro;1 billion by 2007. In 2003 the Vote 39 allocation will be &euro;441 million and the precise annual increases for the years 2004 &ndash; 2007 remain to be determined. The allocation of funds between the bilateral and multilateral headings is determined annually as part of the Estimates process. Decisions on allocations have regard to a wide range of policy issues and are approved by an interdepartmental committee which includes representatives from a range of Departments including the Departments of Finance, Health and Children, and Education and Science.</P>

      <P>Ireland has 50 embassies, five multilateral missions and 11 consulates general and other offices abroad. The following list details the countries and international organisations with which the Government has diplomatic relations at present. Information relating to the number of other members of the EU which have resident missions to each country or organisation is not readily available. The spread of resident Irish missions abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis, but as the Deputy will appreciate constraints on Government expenditure and the limits on the resources available for opening new missions require that any expansion of our diplomatic network must be incremental and be based on a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits involved. In 2001, new embassies were opened in a number of countries which have applied to join the EU  &ndash; Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus and Estonia. A resident mission was also opened in Brazil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's multilateral development assistance is channelled through a number of international bodies and organisations, in particular the United Nations and the European Union. Since the formation of the Government on 26 June 1997, Ireland's contribution to international aid organisations has grown significantly. Additional and more substantial contributions are anticipated in the coming years as the Ireland Aid programme expands to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. Ireland will contribute &euro;38.092 million to <Col N="312" /> UN agencies in 2002, an increase of 45% from the 2001 level of &euro;26.223 million. Ireland Aid's increasingly close involvement with UN agencies enables it to have a greater influence in shaping policy and monitoring expenditure. An important element of this approach is our policy of actively seeking positions on the executive boards of UN agencies. Ireland has just completed a three year term on the joint board of the UN Development Programme, UNDP and the UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA and recently became a board member of UNICEF. It is also a permanent member of the executive committee of UNHCR.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid has focused funding on UN agencies whose policies and programmes are most in line with the national objective of poverty reduction, such as UNDP and UNICEF. It targets resources on agencies that are committed to UN reform, have strong management and whose effectiveness can be gauged through results based budgets. Ireland Aid has commissioned independent reviews of the audit and evaluation systems of UNFPA, UNDP and UNICEF. In 2001 it reviewed the UN High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR and the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and it is now in the process of implementing the recommendations of the reports. These and other methods enable it to monitor carefully how donor resources are used and to encourage greater efficiency in UN development agencies.</P>
      <P>As with the UN, Ireland has been working actively within the EU to improve the quality of its aid programmes. In recent years, these programmes have been hampered by management weaknesses, which have led to a backlog of unspent aid. Ireland has been to the fore in pressing the European Commission to reform the aid programme to address these problems. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has raised this matter directly with Commissioners Neilson and Patten during their visits to Dublin over the past 18 months. Ireland has actively participated in the debates on this topic at the Development Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the pressure from member states, including Ireland, the Commission has embarked on an ambitious and comprehensive process of reforming the management of external aid and its internal structures. These reforms include the successful creation of the EuropeAid Co-operation Office at the start of 2001. Although it will take some time yet before the full benefits of these reforms become evident, the Commission is pressing ahead with an ambitious programme to devolve management responsibilities to its delegations in the field, and it is widely agreed that there has been an improvement in EU performance as regards aid delivery. This is evident, for instance, in the EU's operations in the Balkans and in its speedy mobilisation of assistance for Afghanistan. Multilateral organisations such as the UN and EU are making a major contribution to global development and poverty reduction. Ireland will continue to play an active role within these organisations in the <Col N="313" /> ongoing search for ways to increase the impact of their development assistance.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>The Agency for Personal Service Overseas has been in existence for 28 years and has been the principal vehicle through which thousands of Irish people have provided valuable personal service to the developing world.</P>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers forms part of a process of review and evaluation which has been ongoing in APSO for some time, as the agency endeavours to ensure that its operations remain relevant and effective in a changing development environment. It was commissioned by the board of APSO and is currently being considered by the latter. I am aware of its contents. It has also informed the deliberations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee, which has completed a comprehensive review of the Ireland Aid programme, including APSO. The report of the committee will be published very shortly and will make recommendations on all aspects of Ireland Aid's work. These include general comments on the work done by APSO and suggestions in relation to its future role and structure.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently engaged in developing an information and communications technology strategy for 2002-2005. This is intended to provide the Department with the necessary infrastructure and services to enable the use of information as a strategic resource in representing Ireland internationally and to make the services of the Department more accessible to the public.</P>
      <P>One element of the strategy involves the upgrading of the passport office system to take advantage of advances in secure document technologies and to provide a quicker and more responsive service to the public. Tenders for the design and installation of a new automated passport system have been received and are currently being evaluated and it is hoped to introduce the new system before the end of next year, 2003. The Department plans, as part of this project, to avail of the potential of the Reach project to permit greater on-line access by the public in the future, including, in time, to allow for on-line passport applications.</P>
      <P>The Department has registered a number of passport related website addresses. Persons using these are automatically redirected to the Department's website [www.gov.ie/iveagh] which contains information about the passport service. It is envisaged that these passport related websites will be further developed in the context of the introduction of the automated passport system.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider asking the UN Commission to appoint a special rapporteur on human rights for Algeria; and if he will consider initiatives at EU level to ensure that EU officials are permitted by the Algerian authorities to oversee the articles of association with the EU in respect of democratic principles and respect for human rights.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10126/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government of Algeria continues to oppose the appointment of a UN special rapporteur and it appears that, as on previous occasions, there is insufficient support among the current members of the UN Commission for Human Rights for such a proposal to succeed. In such circumstances, it would be counterproductive were a proposal to be made only to be defeated.</P>
      <P>Reports by both the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the special rapporteur on torture are due to be considered at the forthcoming United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. It is expected that these would, <i>inter alia</i>, comment on developments in Algeria. The question of access for special rapporteurs to report at first hand on human rights situations of concern in a number of countries, not only Algeria, will also be an issue in Geneva. The EU will again call on Algeria to give access to these rapporteurs.</P>
      <P>Ireland and our EU partners will again refer to the situation in Algeria at Geneva under agenda item 9, which concerns the question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to present its view that a more cooperative approach by Algeria to the utilisation of the human rights protection machinery of the United Nations, including the role of special rapporteurs, would be a constructive step in helping to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the current tragic situation and to develop the rule of law and strengthen the democratic process in Algeria.</P>
      <P>When a delegation from the External Relations Directorate of the European Commission under the EU-sponsored initiative for human rights and democracy recently applied to visit Algeria, a problem arose with the visa applications. I am informed that this was of a technical nature. I understand that the visit has had to be postponed, but that it is expected to go ahead in April.</P>
      <P>The visit is part of the EU's bilateral activities with Algeria to promote human rights and democracy and is part of the MEDA programme, the principal financial instrument of the EU for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the human rights dialogue between the EU and Algeria will be enhanced by the recently negotiated EU-Algeria Association Agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. In particular, article 2 of the agreement states that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will guide the internal and international policies of the parties and will constitute an essential element of the agreement. The agreement also commits Algeria to develop the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. <Col N="334" /> Ireland expects to see these commitments implemented fully in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>There are no indications from our contacts with the US Administration, or from discussions between the EU and US on the subject of Iraq, that the US is considering taking military action against Iraq in the near future.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with the Taoiseach, President Bush expressed grave concern at Iraq's defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, the threat posed by Iraqi efforts to develop chemical and biological weapons and its refusal to co-operate with the UN disarmament mission. However, President Bush indicated that the US has no immediate plans for military action. The US Administration has indicated that it is reviewing policy on Iraq but that, at present, its efforts will continue to be focused on achieving agreement in the Security Council on reform of sanctions and for the return of the UN arms inspectors. Following the meeting, the Taoiseach expressed the view that President Bush wanted to see justice, peace and the wellbeing of the world protected and that he was prepared to make every necessary effort to achieve that.</P>

      <P>The Digital Hub is a development project to cluster Irish and international new media companies, research and development and educational initiatives in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin. It is part of the drive to make <Col N="335" /> Ireland an international centre for high-tech research and cutting edge digital industry.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the Digital Hub project transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to my Department on 22 May 2001. This included responsibility for MediaLabEurope, the flagship project of the Digital Hub. Since that time the following progress has been made: the development plan for the project was launched in December of last year following extensive consultation with community interests in the area; purchase of property for the hub has now been completed and Digital Media Development Limited, the body established to oversee the development of the hub, will be embarking on a PPP process for its refurbishment shortly; work is under way on the installation of broadband infrastructure in the area; agreements are being finalised for an incubator centre in partnership between DMDL, Enterprise Ireland and Dublin City Council; and a number of ICT educational initiatives aimed at the local community are about to get under way.</P>
      <P>Expenditure to date is as follows: Department of the Taoiseach &ndash;&euro;17.78 million funding for MLE; and &euro;232.36k for operating expenses for DMDL. Department of Public Enterprise &euro;73.64 million on property purchase; &euro;2.54 million on operating expenses for DMDL; &euro;11.43 million in Government funding for MLE; and &euro;2.54 million on funding for collaborative research between MLE and Irish universities.</P>
      <P>One civil servant has been seconded from the Department of the Taoiseach to MLE to act as chief operating officer. Day to day operations on the Digital Hub project are undertaken by an executive services team appointed by the board of DMDL and headed by Magahy &amp; Co. The team receives a fixed fee per month of &euro;139,670 per month to end December 2003.</P>

      <P>Mr. William Prasifka was appointed Commissioner for Aviation Regulation on 27 February 2001 in accordance with section 11 of the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001. The Civil Service Commission ran the selection process for this <Col N="336" /> post. Mr. Prasifka obtained his legal qualification in the United States and worked in the area of competition law both in the US and Ireland. However, a legal qualification was not a specific requirement in the competition for the post of Commissioner for Aviation Regulation. Mr. Prasifka's remuneration is in accordance with the advertised terms of the post.</P>
      <P>On 11 May 2001, Mr. Patrick Keane, Senior Counsel, was appointed to carry out a review of the public inquiry which was held into the non-fatal accident to the Aer Lingus DC 3 near Birmingham, UK, on 1 January 1953 which had been carried out by Judge Thomas Teevan. Mr. Keane's appointment was governed by the qualification requirements laid down in SI 205 of 1997 Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations, 1997 which stipulated that a review shall be conducted by a barrister of not less than ten years' experience or by a person with aeronautical knowledge. Remuneration in regard to Mr. Keane's services will be decided on the advice of the Attorney General's office.</P>
      <P>The Minister established a panel of three members on 12 November 2001 in accordance with section 40 of the Aviation Regulation Act, 2001, to consider appeals against the determination of the Commission for Aviation Regulation on airport charges at State airports issued on 26 August 2001. Mr. Rory Brady, senior counsel, was appointed chairman of the panel. The panel completed its work within the prescribed period of two months and now stands dissolved in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Although it is not a requirement of the Act for any appointee to the panel to have a legal qualification, it was felt that between them, the appointees should have a range of expertise in the legal, economic and technical fields given the particular nature of the work involved in the appeals process. Mr. Brady's fee rate in connection with his work on the panel is &euro;889 per day plus expenses and his invoice is awaited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission, military service allowance was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Commission on Public Service Pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the MSA, and the consequences for pensioners generally in its final report which was published in January 2001. However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with longstanding public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised in the context of the Government's consideration of the commission's final report.</P>
      <P>I should say that the commission, whose report is the first comprehensive examination of public service pension arrangements since the foundation of the State, was an independent body. It had invited submissions from interested parties through an advertisement in the national press in September 1996 and I understand that groups representative of military pensioners were among those who made submissions and were met by the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 171 together.</P>
      <P>On 17 January 2002, I authorised my Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations, Inc., Connecticut, USA, for the purchase of three medium range helicopters &ndash; S-92s &ndash; for search and rescue purposes. The negotiations were also to include an option exercisable within three years by the Department for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport. The decision followed from a detailed examination of the tenders received from the four companies: Sikorsky, USA; CHC Scotia, Scotland; EH Industries Limited, UK, and Eurocopter, France.</P>
      <P>The offer from Sikorsky was deemed to be the most strategically and economically advantageous tender taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition, which were: functional characteristics; technical merit; all maintenance and on-line technical support; after sales service and warranty terms on offer; cost and ready availability of spare parts; tender prices and life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period. I am satisfied, that on the basis of the facts presented to me, that the offer from Sikorsky would provide best value for money from the taxpayers point of view. The time frame proposed by Sikorsky would see the delivery of three search and rescue helicopters by the end of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from my decision of 17 January 2002, Eurocopter sought the reasons for the acceptance of the Sikorsky tender and the rejection of its tender pursuant to Article 7 of EU Public Procurement Directive 93/36/EC as amended. A reply issued from the Chief State <Col N="353" /> Solicitor's Office to solicitors acting for Eurocopter in this matter on 6 February 2002. In addition, solicitors acting for Eurocopter submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, seeking documentation relating to the tender competition.</P>
    <P>Eurocopter subsequently issued judicial review proceedings alleging,<i> inter alia</i>, that I was in breach of my obligations under Directive 93/36 as amended to furnish the characteristics and relative advantages of the tender selected. The proceedings sought certain information and documents from me in relation to the tender procedure and award. The judicial review proceedings were adjourned with consent on Friday, 15 March 2002 until the 15 April 2002 for mention.</P>
    <P>The request under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, from Eurocopter has been progressed as far as possible by the Department at this stage and documentation relating to the competition has been passed on to solicitors acting for Eurocopter.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to deal with the Chief State Solicitor's Office on the judicial review proceedings. It is my intention to be as forthcoming as possible in this regard. However, as the matter is due to come before the courts again in mid-April I do not wish to say anything further at this stage. I should say, however, that to date no proceedings have been issued challenging my decision to open contract negotiations with Sikorsky.</P>

      <P>Under the 2001 ewe premium scheme the person named applied on 160 ewes. To enable his application to be processed for payment a form EP250 was sent to him seeking details of any losses incurred during the retention period. The completed form was returned indicating that he had incurred no losses. However, following the additional checks and controls which were put in place during the foot and mouth alert, it emerged that the person named had disposed of ten sheep within the retention period. At a follow up inspection of his flock he presented 140 ewes. Following this inspection he was informed that, as he had not satisfactorily accounted for the shortfall of 20 sheep, he was deemed to have made a false declaration on the form EP250 and under the terms and conditions of the ewe premium scheme the penalty was the loss of ewe premium for 2001 and debarment from the 2002 scheme. The person <Col N="356" /> named sought a review of this decision by the local inspectorate who upheld the original ruling. He subsequently took his case to the appeals unit which ruled that payment should be made on the 140 sheep found in his flock subject to a penalty in respect of the shortfall of 20 sheep. This payment was made on 13 March 2002.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the fallen animal scheme, the rendering of all fallen animals delivered to approved plants and the disposal of the resultant meat and bone meal is subsidised by my Department. This arrangement, which includes sheep, was put in place at the same time as a subsidised collection service was set up for fallen bovines. While the collection from farms of fallen bovines is subsidised at fixed rates per collected animal, this particular aspect of the scheme does not extend to animals other than bovines.</P>
      <P>The fact that a comprehensive collection scheme for bovines at reasonable charges per animal collected is now in place, and the fact that non bovines delivered to approved rendering plants do not incur a charge, means that fallen sheep can be collected at reasonable cost. Unlike in the case of cattle, the option to bury sheep on farm under licence from the district veterinary office is open to producers in certain circumstances. The option is also open to producers to deliver fallen sheep to registered knackeries where a nominal charge is imposed for taking the carcass to the rendering plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to further facilitate farmers specifically in relation to the disposal of fallen sheep, my Department is currently examining the possibility of introducing a number of collection points at specified locations so that the options available to sheep farmers are increased. All in all, I am <Col N="358" /> satisfied that the fallen animal scheme as introduced by me last year at an annual cost of &euro;25 million is working well and providing a good service to farmers.</P>

For farmers currently making applications under this scheme the previous tax year runs from 5 April 2001 to the 31 December 2001.

      <P>To qualify for aid under the installation aid scheme, IAS, the initial application must include confirmation that the associated setting up costs &ndash; for example, stamp duty, legal and accountancy fees, etc., remain to be discharged by the young farmer at the time of application. This was a specific requirement of the EU Commission when it approved the scheme.</P>
      <P>Applicants are, therefore, obliged to make their initial application within four months of taking over the farm, to ensure that the Department has been notified of their intention to seek installation aid before the related set up costs have been discharged. The four month period is therefore in place as a protection for applicants. The operation of the scheme is currently being reviewed with a view to further simplification. This four month time period for the initial application will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>The IMPACT Union has withdrawn its co-operation in respect of the processing of all REP scheme applications in all FDS offices throughout the country on the basis that a satisfactory solution to the implementation of the recommendations of a report carried out by the management services division of my Department on the staffing in the technical agricultural officer grades of the farm development service areas has not been finalised.</P>
      <P>However, the position is that the substantive problem identified in the report was the bottleneck at supervisory agricultural officer grade and the recommendations in the report to resolve this problem were to provide seven extra supervisory agricultural officer posts and to review the staffing position over time.</P>
      <P>My Department has not only agreed to fully implement these recommendations but has offered to increase the number of supervisory agricultural officer posts recommended in the report from seven to 12 to address not only the current staffing position but to take into account increasing workloads in the longer term.</P>

    <P>The IMPACT Union, despite the recommendations of the report, does not accept that my Department's offer of the assignment of the additional staff is a satisfactory solution.

He disposed of three animals inside the six months retention period and provided details of two cows and one heifer as replacements. Under the terms and conditions of the scheme a heifer must be at least eight months old at the time of replacement. Records show that the heifer tag number 271030690166 was under eight months old at the time of replacement and is, therefore, not suitable. The herdowner has been contacted regarding this matter.

      <P>There were some delays in processing a relatively small number of 2001 scheme cases due to the introduction of a new mapping and area payments computer system. The 2001 area aid application of the person named has been fully processed. The person named submitted four 2001 special beef premium applications in respect of a total of 103 animals as follows: 13 animals on 6 March 2001; 22 animals on 16 August 2001; 61 animals on 29 November 2001 and seven animals on 29 December, 2001.</P>

One animal listed on the third application died during the retention <Col N="362" /> period and was deleted without penalty.

The person named submitted two applications in respect of a total of 44 animals for special beef premium 2001. An 80% advance payment has issued in respect of 29 animals. Balancing payments will issue next month. Payment will also issue in respect of a further 15 eligible animals as soon as possible now that outstanding queries in relation to the cattle movement monitoring system have been resolved. One further animal has been deleted from the application as premium had previously been paid on that animal. The person named has established eligibility for slaughter premium 2001 in respect of 31 animals. Advance payment had issued in respect of one animal prior to the herd being selected for an on-farm inspection. This inspection has now been completed and the 80% advance payment on the remaining 30 animals will issue shortly. Balancing payments will commence in May 2002 when the national quota position has been established.</P>

      <P>The legislation governing the establishment of the new independent agriculture appeals office was enacted in July 2001. It is envisaged that the office will be operational in the spring of this year. The office will be based in Portlaoise and will have a staff of approximately 22 at the outset and this will be reviewed based on actual experience of workload. The Civil Service Commission interdepartmental competition for the appointment of the director of the office has been advertised and the competition is ongoing at this time. The selection pro<Col N="363" /> cess for the appeals officers has been initiated and the recruitment of the remaining staff will commence shortly thereafter. Arrangements for the provision of the necessary accommodation are well advanced. When the director is appointed and the new office is established appeals made to the director under section 7 of the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001, will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Act and any Regulations made thereunder in relation to procedures to be followed on such appeals.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the report prepared by the FAPRI-Ireland Partnership, in the context of a medium-term analysis of the agri-food sector; and the measures his Department has put in place to secure the long-term survival of rural Ireland.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is the FAPRI-Ireland &lsquo;Outlook 2000' report, which was published in March 2000. FAPRI-Ireland subsequently published an &lsquo;Outlook 2001' report in April 2001. Its &lsquo;Outlook 2002' report will be published at the end of April this year. There are considerable differences in the projections shown in each year's outlook report, due to changes in the market situation and prospects. The latest published results, which are in the Outlook 2001' report, project a baseline of no policy change in which aggregate farm income would increase by 4% in nominal terms over the period 2000 to 2010.</P>
      <P>Average farm income is calculated by dividing aggregate farm income by the number of farms. As current trends both in Ireland and internationally suggest that there will be a decline in farm numbers, mainly in small farms under 20 hectares, over the same period average farm income in nominal terms will increase at a much faster rate than aggregate income. This should be sufficient to at least match inflation. It should also be borne in mind that over 60% of farm household income now comes from off-farm activities. This part of farm income is not included in the FAPRI-Ireland analysis but is likely to continue to grow, as the number of part time farmers increases in the future. Neither is income earned on-farm from non-farm activities such as rural tourism included in the analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the planning for the future of rural Ireland, I established an independent group, the Agri Food 2010 Committee, to propose a long-term strategy for the agriculture and the food industries. The committee delivered its report in March 2000. In August 2000, I published the Agri Food 2010 plan of action, which sets out the Government's policy response to the committee's recommendations. The plan of action envis<Col N="364" /> ages a dynamic agri-food sector in 2010 which offers farm families attractive and sustainable livelihood options, thus ensuring the maintenance of the maximum number on the land; has the necessary strength to compete successfully within the EU and on our main third country markets; values our rural environment as the basis of thriving rural communities; and is focused on meeting consumer demands, particularly for the highest standards of food safety.</P>
    <P>The plan of action contains 197 specific action points aimed at achieving this vision. An implementation report, published last December, shows that 94% of the action points are either complete or have seen substantial action taken. In addition the White Paper on Rural Development, which was published in August 1999, sets out a vision and framework for the development of our rural communities. The overall strategy provides for balanced regional development; investment in services and infrastructure; sustainable economic development; human resources development; a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion; and preservation of the culture and heritage of rural areas and protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>The main instrument for the delivery of the 2010 vision and the rural development strategy is the funding contained in the national development plan. The NDP provides &euro;8.5 billion over the period 2000 to 2006 for rural areas, including just under &euro;6.1 billion for agriculture, food and related rural development. The CLÁR programme for revitalising rural areas was launched in October 2001 to promote social inclusion in 16 targeted rural areas. In addition to the NDP investments, there will be &euro;25.4 million available over the period to 2003 to underpin the success of the programme.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the necessary policy framework underpinned by both national and EU funding is in place. Together with appropriate monitoring and review arrangements it ensures the development of agriculture and rural society in a manner which will benefit all rural dwellers.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in answer to Question No. 188 on 7 March last I established an organic development committee in November 2000, as recommended in the report of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee. The committee is in the final stages of its deliberations and will submit its report shortly. I am aware that the committee &ndash; on which Teagasc is represented along with the Western Development Commission and all the major stakeholders in the organic sector &ndash; has given particular consideration to the areas of research, advice, training and education and will be making recommendations on these subjects that are designed to enhance the scope for the development of the organic sector in the west and throughout the country. I look forward to receiving the committee's report and I will give careful consideration to their recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that organic farming should be recognised not so much as an alternative to mainstream agriculture but rather as a part of it, offering real opportunities to Irish farmers in an expanding and potentially very lucrative market. While I expect the recommendations of the organic development committee to make a major contribution to the development of policy for the organic sector, my Department has already given very substantial support to the sector through the rural environmental protection scheme and the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector. Under the first REPS scheme, introduced in 1994, 821 organic farmers received financial support totalling over &euro;28 million and I am hopeful that under the new scheme which began in 2000 this achievement will be considerably surpassed. For the period to 2006 the Government have provided over &euro;8 million for the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector to support both on-farm and off-farm investment, and I would encourage both farmers and food processors to make use of this scheme to develop their activities in a way that will allow them to seize the opportunities offered by the growing demand for organic produce.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted an incomplete area aid application for 2001 and my Department has been in contact with him with a view to his supplying additional information. Until this matter is resolved no area aid payments can issue. The animal based headage schemes have been replaced in 2001 by the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. A condition of the new scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, but according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum stocking density. My Department will be in contact with the person named shortly with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to area-based compensatory allowance will then be made.</P>

      <P>Under EU regulations, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven are required to use at least 90% of the quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve. The person named held a suckler cow quota of 18 premium rights but used only seven in 2001. He was written to in September 2001 seeking the reasons for the non use of at least 90% of his quota. In his reply he said that he intended to increase the number of heifers that will be eligible for the suckler cow premium scheme in 2002. In the light of that reply, he was allowed retain his full quota of 18 premium rights for 2002 strictly on the basis that he would use at least 90% in 2002.</P>
      <P>He wrote again on 7 March and said that he could only keep six cows for 2002 mainly due to financial and personal pressure. As these reasons cannot be regarded as constituting exceptional circumstances, they could not be accepted, and he was so informed on 12 March. However, if he can furnish evidence that he cannot use at least 90% of his quota in 2002 because of exceptional circumstances, i.e. circumstances outside his control and which he could not have foreseen, I will have the matter examined again.</P>

      <P>The person named is an applicant under the 2001 suckler cow scheme for small-scale milk suppliers. The milk quota held by him at 31 March 2001, is 29,642 gallons. The number of cows required to produce this quota is 33.84. This is ascertained by dividing the quota, 29,642 gallons by an average milk yield of 876 gallons. The person named declared on the date of application that the total number of cows both dairy and suckler, owned, possessed, held and maintained by him on his holding was 33. As he has insufficient cows to fill his milk quota, there are no surplus cows eligible for suckler cow premium payment and the person named is therefore not entitled to payment for 2001.</P>

      <P>The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. The tribunal also considers applications for temporary allocations to producers who encounter quota difficulties due to animal disease restrictions. The person in question submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of animal disease. The tribunal examined this application in January and he was granted an allocation of 18,000 litres. He was notified of this decision at the time. The tribunal has now completed its work for the current milk quota year.</P>

      <P>The procedure for disposing of reactor animals under the TB and brucellosis disease eradication schemes operates on the basis that meat factories tender on a weekly basis for the slaughter of these animals and my Department selects the meat factories on the basis of the prices that they offer for different types of animals. The compensation for reactor animals comprises the salvage value of the animal which is paid by the factory directly to the farmer and a reactor grant, or live valuation less the salvage value, paid to the farmer by my Department. It is important to note that at all times the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer and therefore the contract for the salvage value is a matter between the farmer and the meat factory involved. My Department's responsibility is to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and to pay the appropriate compensation. In the circumstances where a factory goes out of business, such as has happened in the case in question, the recovery of any moneys due to losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between themselves and the company's liquidators.</P>

      <P>Proposals were submitted to the European Union in October 2001 for increased payment rates under the area based compensatory allowance scheme for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposals involve making a payment of &euro;101.58 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of &euro;88.88 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. However, the Environment Directorate of the European Union has indicated that they would not be willing for this increased payment to be approved by the Union's Star Committee until Ireland has made a formal decision in relation to the implementation of the Nitrates Directive. Ongoing discussions are taking place between the Department of Environment and Local Government and the farming organisations in relation to this matter. Subject to the necessary EU approval, it is intended that the revised payment rates will apply to the 2001 scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <b>(Mr. Walsh): </b>The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system. The tribunal also considers applications for temporary allocations to producers who encounter quota difficulties due to animal disease restrictions. The person in question has submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of animal disease. His application was examined by the tribunal and he has been notified of the outcome.</P>

      <Quest>if the home maker's allowance for stay-at-home spouses, to be paid at full old age non-contributory pension rates, will be used as a taxable base for another income in the household; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the home carer's tax credit, which was an allowance when introduced and is now a credit. I introduced it in the Finance Act, 2000, and it is designed to recognise the contribution made by a spouse who remains working in the home in order to care for certain dependent persons, who may not be the spouse of the claimant. The dependent person is defined as a child in respect of whom child benefit is being paid, a person aged 65 years or over, or a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. This definition includes a person related by marriage to the claimant and a person in respect of whom the claimant is or was the legal guardian. The tax credit currently amounts to &euro;770 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision is intended to cover situations where a spouse has forfeited a second income to care for dependants in the home. However, there is an income disregard, whereby the home carer may have some income in their own right without <Col N="378" /> affecting his or her spouse's eligibility for the tax credit. In addition, there is a taper system, which means the tax credit is not lost all at once when income exceeds the amount of the disregard. There is no income test in relation to the person being cared for.</P>
    <P>The tax credit is due in full where the home carer's annual income does not exceed &euro;5,080 and where it exceeds that amount, the tax credit is reduced by half the excess. Effectively &euro;1 of tax credit is subtracted for every &euro;2 by which the income exceeds &euro;5,080, so that where the annual income exceeds &euro;6,620 no tax credit is due. For example, if the income of the carer is &euro;5,850, a reduced tax credit of &euro;385 applies. Carer's benefit and carer's allowance, payable under the Social Welfare Acts, are disregarded for determining entitlement to the home carer's tax credit. The maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension is currently &euro;134 per week, that is &euro;6,992 per annum, which exceeds the maximum level of income set out above though reduced levels of pension might fall within income ranges which could qualify.</P>

    <P>My Department's Budget 2002 forecasts are based on GNP growth of 3.5% this year. This compares with the Central Bank's winter 2001 bulletin forecast of 3% &ndash; 3.5% and an ESRI forecast of 2.1% in its quarterly economic commentary, December 2001. My Department has also produced economic growth forecasts for the period 2003 and 2004, and these are shown in table 2 below.</P>
    <P>My Department has not published forecasts beyond 2004. However, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the ESRI's Medium Term Review, 2001 &ndash; 2007, completed in advance of the events of September 11 last, which contains forecasts out to 2007. Two main scenarios were considered. Its &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo; forecast assumed a relatively benign situation in which the economy slows gently from the very strong growth rates recorded until recently. An accompanying &ldquo;slowdown&rdquo; forecast assumed lower growth in the short-term followed by a stronger medium-term performance. Both sets of forecasts are shown in table 2.</P>

      <P>The nature of the question being posed is not clear but I trust the following will be of assistance to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in accordance with section 957 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, if an inspector of taxes is not satisfied with all the data in the tax return for the relevant year, or if no return has been made, the inspector is empowered to make an assessment. A person may appeal against such an assessment on the fulfilment of two conditions, namely, that the person must send a tax return to the Inspector for the relevant year of assessment, and the person must pay, to the extent that he has not done so, an amount of tax equal to the tax which would be payable without altering or departing from the data given in that tax return and, if appropriate, any interest in respect of late payment or any costs incurred in pursuing collection.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that such an appeal is limited to disputing any amount of income, deduction, allowance or relief specified in the assessment to the extent that it differs from the corresponding amount in the tax return or agreed with the inspector. The tax payable in the assessment, to the extent that it results from the undisputed amount of income, deduction and so forth remains payable on the due date notwithstanding the appeal. As a result of this, there is no need for an accelerated procedure for recovery of tax which is admitted to be due. This does not interfere with an appeal by a person on a disputed amount. The Revenue Commissioners' collection policy is to recover pre-appeal tax liability together with interest, if appropriate, with as little delay as possible.</P>

      <Col N="383" /> The Revenue Commissioners have provided the following details of their appointments. In September, 1999, the Revenue Commissioners established a new review procedure involving a three member panel of external reviewers. The review procedure can be initiated by taxpayers when they are dissatisfied with the manner in which Revenue powers are being exercised, or indeed with any aspect of a Revenue audit or enquiry. Of the panel, Ms Ita Mangan is a barrister and Ms Edwina Dunn is a solicitor. The advertisement for appointing external reviewers stated that &ldquo;applicants, who may be retired persons should have relevant experience (for example in the legal, academic or accountancy fields).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Total payments made by Revenue from September 1999 to February 2002 are to Ms Ita Mangan, &euro;4,426 and to Ms Edwina Dunn, &euro;20,832. The contract with the external reviewers is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Six firms of solicitors, listed below, were appointed by Revenue to provide legal services to Revenue for the purpose of collecting outstanding tax and interest. The terms of the contracts are from 1 January, 2000 to 31 December 2004. It was a requirement of the tendering process that applicants be practising solicitors. Total payments made by Revenue to each firm for the years 2000 and 2001 are set out below.</P>

    <P>In line with best practice, the Revenue Commissioners established an audit committee in December 1998. The role of the Committee is to oversee the internal audit function in Revenue and to advise the Revenue board on the oper<Col N="384" /> ation and development of that function. The Committee is comprised of senior officers from a variety of bodies. One former member, Mr. Donal Cahalane, who was head of internal audit in the Central Bank at the time, and one current member, Ms Catherine Treacy, chief executive and registrar of deeds and titles, land registry and registry of deeds, have legal qualifications. Both were appointed by the board to the committee with effect from December 1998. Both Mr. Cahalane and Ms Treacy hold a BL qualification. Mr. Cahalane resigned from the committee in November 2001 to take up an assignment with the World Bank in Washington. Members of the audit committee are not remunerated for this role. The appointment of Mr. Cahalane and Ms Treacy to the committee was not contingent on their legal qualifications.</P>

      <P>The collection of tax is a matter placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners. Decisions in relation to any specific case are not matters in which the Minister for Finance has a function. However, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is, in fact, no tax liability for the year 90/91, but there is a liability outstanding, &euro;387.93, that consists mainly of PRSI and levies. This liability is based on a return submitted and is properly due and payable. Payment may also be in the person's own interest as the PRSI payment involved is the minimum due from a self employed person, and provides social insurance cover for a range of benefits, including the old age pension. Taking account of the circumstances of the case, Revenue is prepared to defer pursuit of the liability for the present.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government will consider introducing a scheme to encourage wealthy Irish people to donate large sums of money for good causes such as the provision of lifeboats, hospital wards and equipment and other worthwhile causes.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9206/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have long believed that providing tax relief for donations to worthy causes stimulates individuals and companies to donate money to them. I also believe that if people want to donate money to good causes, then tax relief should be provided to encourage them to do so. Therefore, prior to last year's Finance Act, I decided to look at the whole area of tax relief for donations. At that time there <Col N="388" /> were thirteen different reliefs for donations to various bodies with widely differing qualifying conditions. Having considered the area carefully, I decided to simplify and rationalise the various tax reliefs in this area and, as part of this simplification process, most of the existing tax reliefs for donations were allowed to lapse.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in Finance Act 2001, I introduced a new scheme of tax relief on donations made by either individuals or corporate bodies to eligible charities and other approved bodies including first and second level schools and third level institutions including universities. An eligible charity is any charity in the State which has been granted exemption from tax for a period of not less than three years and which is authorised by the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of the new scheme. The minimum qualifying donation for relief purposes to an eligible charity or approved body is &euro;250 per annum and there is no upper limit on the amount which can be donated. Donations for any one year can be on a cumulative basis so that a weekly donation of &euro;5 can qualify for the relief. The relief on the donation will be at an individual's marginal rate of tax.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations will depend on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer or an individual on self-assessment or a company. For a PAYE taxpayer, the relief will be given at the donor's marginal rate of income tax and will be given on a grossed up basis to the charity. This means the tax refund will go to the charity. In the case of a donation made by an individual who is self-assessed, the individual will claim the relief and there is no grossing up arrangement. Similarly, in the case of companies, they can claim deductions for donations as if they were a trading expense. I believe sincerely that this simple and widely expanded tax relief will encourage greater giving.</P>
      <P>I announced in the budget last December that donations made to certain sports capital projects may benefit from tax relief. I am happy to have been able to do this, as I am confident that this new scheme of relief will act as a major incentive for the development and improvement of sports facilities throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" />It is possible under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 23) Order, 1992, to receive a refund of the VAT incurred in respect of the purchase and donation to a hospital or medical institution of medical equipment for the purpose of medical research, diagnosis, prevention or treatment of illness. This applies where the value of the item exceeds &euro;25,390 is purchased by voluntary subscription and is approved by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The Government has also shown its commitment to encouraging businesses to make donations to good causes in other ways. For example, the Foundation for Investing in Communities was founded in November 1998 with the help of a grant from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The foundation was set up to provide increased recognition for businesses who are making corporate social responsibility an essential part of their business. This work is carried out by Business in the Community (BITC) &ndash; Ireland, a company established in January 2000, under the umbrella of the foundation. Through BITC, the foundation encourages and supports Irish businesses to place corporate social responsibility and community involvement in the mainstream of their business practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic position as set out in paragraph (vii), Second Schedule, VAT Act, 1972, as amended, is that food and drink in general is zero rated and this applies in general to basic food items. Food products sold in a retail outlet can be subject to zero, 12.5% or 21% rate depending on the type of product. Tea and coffee sold in a retail outlet are zero rated but are subject to VAT at 12.5% when purchased as part of a meal in a restaurant or similar establishment or from a vending machine or purchased for &ldquo;take out&rdquo;. Soft drinks, fruit juice, bottled water and other similar products are subject to 21% wherever they are purchased. Tea and coffee are considered to be basic food items whereas soft drinks, juices and bottled water are not considered as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1992, however, while soft drinks in general were subject to the standard rate of VAT, certain bottled waters, fruit juices and sports drinks were at 0%. These were made subject to the standard rate of VAT of 21%, however, from 1 November 1992. The change in the law corrected a competitive anomaly. The amendment in the law also coincided with the removal of excise duty on bottled water.  Under EU VAT law it is not possible to zero rate goods and services which were not zero rated before 1 January 1991. Thus it would not be possible to remove VAT from <Col N="390" /> soft drinks to which the standard VAT rate applied prior to that date. While some fruit juices and bottled waters continued to be zero rated up to 1 November 1992, the application to these products of the standard VAT rate from that date prevents the reintroduction of a zero rate of VAT. In general, it is the position that even if a product was zero rated after 1991 but subsequently standard rated it is not possible to reintroduce the zero rate for the product. Even if it were possible to zero rate these goods, it would reintroduce the competitive anomaly between water and juices and soft drinks removed in 1992. I have no plans therefore to change the current VAT treatment of such products.</P>

      <P>The serious physical assault scheme, as revised recently, provides for special sick pay arrangements for a period up to six months, with provision for two further extensions of three months each. These extensions will be granted where a return to work is highly probable.</P>
      <P>The scheme also provides that where a health board employee has not recovered from his/her injuries or is certified permanently incapacitated as a result of a serious physical assault incurred in the course of his/her duty, article 109 of the local government superannuation scheme may be invoked. Under the terms of that scheme, a grant not exceeding five sixths of remuneration, inclusive of the money value of emoluments, of the position in which he/she received the injury is payable. The scheme also provides for a refund of expenditure incurred in respect of treatment provided by the Irish public health service. General practitioner, casualty and consultant visits, and prescription charges, can be recouped under the terms of the scheme. Similar arrangements apply in the public voluntary hospital and mental handicap sector.</P>

      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector service providers, is currently developing the national physical and sensory disability database. When complete, the database will provide a detailed picture of the service requirements, including the requirements for respite care and personal assistance services, for people with physical and sensory disabilities over a five year period. The database will assist in the discussions on the 2003 Estimates and will facilitate quality services to be planned and co-ordinated in the most efficient manner possible.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that since coming into office, significant additional funding of just over &euro;175 million has been provided for the maintenance and development of health related services, including respite care and personal assistance services, for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This level of funding is indicative of the Government's ongoing commitment to people with disabilities and I wish to assure the Deputy that the development of services in the sector will remain one of my priorities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the special housing aid scheme for the elderly is operated by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government who fund it and also chair and service the task force which oversees the overall management of the scheme and draws up general guidelines as appropriate.</P>
      <P>During 2001 the Southern Health Board received an allocation of £1 million, &euro;1.27 million, from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to operate the scheme. A total of 934 jobs were completed on foot of that allocation. As at 31 December 2001, the board had 965 applications on hand.</P>
      <P>The task force has advised the Southern Health Board that it has made an initial allocation of &euro;1.27 million to the board for 2002. The board estimates, at present, that this allocation will clear the applications currently on hand. The average length of time, in the Southern Health Board, from receipt of application to approval is four months, with a further average four months from approval to completion of works. The average, therefore, from application to completion of works is eight months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from concerns about the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice in the past, the chief medical officer, CMO, at my Department asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for its comments and advice on the matter.</P>
      <P>The institute represents obstetrical and gynaecological opinion in Ireland, acts as an advisory body on matters relating to education, research and administration in the specialty and seeks to raise standards in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute has replied to the CMO and confirms that from around 1920 until around 1960 symphysiotomy procedures were carried out on selected patients, mainly in the National <Col N="404" /> Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Hospital. The institute informed the CMO that excellent results were claimed for the procedure which permanently enlarged the pelvis and allowed women have a normal delivery. This was at a time when caesarean section had a high mortality rate due to sepsis. Sepsis was one of the leading causes of maternal death at that time. The institute states that in properly conducted cases, complications were rare. I am informed that published medical reports of the time indicated favourable results for the procedure. Many of the cases referred to in these reports were emergency admissions with obstructed labour where sepsis following caesarean section would have carried a significant risk of maternal death.</P>
    <P>The institute states that from 1950 onwards, the operation of symphysiotomy for obstructed labour was replaced by the modern caesarean section. Antibiotics were available by then to treat infection and sepsis was less of a hazard.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that we must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in the light of current knowledge and experience. Enormous medical advances have been made since the 1950s and 1960s and medical care and procedures were not as advanced then as they are in Ireland today.</P>

      <P>Normally medical card holders choose to attend a specific doctor and it is only in the case of emergency or unavailability of the doctor concerned that prescriptions should be issued by an alternative practitioner.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for monitoring of medical prescriptions generally, include inspections by inspectors of the Irish Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and information made available to health boards via the General Medical Services (Payments) Board. Where concerns arise in relation to controlled drugs referral may be made to the Medical Council or to my Department depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The Acts allow for the setting up of a committee of inquiry where appropriate to investigate any suspected case of irresponsible prescribing of controlled drugs. The Acts also provide for the issuing of a special direction which would prohibit a medical practitioner from prescribing specified controlled drugs where such a practitioner is found to be irresponsibly prescribing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" />In addition, in accordance with the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council can investigate complaints of misconduct by medical practitioners and, where a <i>prima facia</i> case is found, a fitness to practice inquiry can be established.</P>
    <P>My Department's chief medical officer has communicated a number of times in the past few years with general practitioners concerning the need to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs and my Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that such prescribing continues to be done in a reasonable fashion.</P>

      <P>Non-consultant hospital doctors are regarded as doctors in training and as such receive further education from the practical application of medicine in hospitals and also from teaching sessions provided by the consultants. Under the terms of their current contract, consultants are required to engage in teaching and education. This responsibility will not change in any new consultants' contract that may be negotiated. However, the requirements in relation to post-graduate medical education are changing in that more protected time for education and training is being sought. These requirements are issues which will have to be considered in the context of the review of the common contract.</P>

      <P>At the commencement of the NDP, my Department notified indicative funding figures to the health boards for the years 2001-2006. Indicative figures were not given to the boards for 2000 as this was a transitional year to meet previous and ongoing capital commitments in the health sector. The indicative funding figures were prepared for major care programmes for each board for 2001-06 in line with a number of criteria.</P>

      <P>While my Department is at present reviewing the NDP, it is intended that health boards will receive, in so far as is possible, the funding indicated to them over the life of the plan.

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on recent comments by a person (details supplied) who has called for a major review of a whole scheme to be undertaken due to the fact that the scheme has failed to reach a 95% uptake target and more recently has been the subject of concerns over non-implementation of general practitioner agreements relating to the scheme and on the issue of MMR vaccine safety.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the article concerning the primary childhood immunisation programme which appeared in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> dated 25 February 2002. The operation of the programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards, who enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service. Provisional data provided by the National Disease Surveillance Centre indicates that immunisation uptake for the period 1 January to 30 September 2001 is as follows: DTaP/DT, 85%; Hib, 84%; polio, 85%; and MMR, 75%. Uptake still falls short of the national target of 95%. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates in childhood immunisations because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. The outbreak of measles in 2000 which resulted in three deaths and over 1,500 cases is evidence of the consequences of insufficient immunisation uptake.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes, including the identification of issues which are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. The steering committee was assisted by four working groups, which examined the following areas in relation to immunisation: communication, material management, IT systems and planning and organisation. I understand the report of the steering committee will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the MMR vaccine the international consensus is that this is safe and effective and that the recently published medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR and autism. The institutions involved include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the British Committee on Safety of Medicines, the World Health Organisation, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA, the American Academy of Paediatrics and UK professional organisations. Most <Col N="408" /> recently, the US Institute of Medicine also concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has indicated that observations made regarding the onset of autism following the administration of MMR vaccine do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest that the vaccine is the cause. It has also indicated that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of the MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the RCPI.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children, in its report on childhood immunisation published in July 2001, concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine. In 2001, following negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the primary childhood immunisation programme, it was agreed to carry out a review of the GP workload under the programme. This review was to be carried out in the context of the broader review of general practice which has now been further developed in the new primary care strategy, Primary Care &ndash; A New Direction. Officials of my Department met recently with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation and the Health Services Employers Agency to discuss this matter. It was agreed that the immunisation workload review would now proceed as an independent review. The terms of reference of the review and the appointment of an independent evaluator are to be agreed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Contracting general practitioners are entitled to bonus payments for each calendar year where they achieve a 95% uptake in respect of the cohort of children on their panel who reach their second birthday during that year. This payment is due within three months following the calendar year in which uptake levels are calculated. GPs enter into a contract with their health boards and if payment has not been made to them they should raise the issue of outstanding payment with the appropriate health board.</P>

      <P>The detailed use of this funding and the phasing of developments at the hospital are matters for the Western Health Board. I have asked the chief executive officer of the health board to reply to the Deputy directly in relation to the detailed queries raised in the question and I understand a reply is being prepared and will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>The document, Primary Care, A New Direction, published as part of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You, indicates that a needs assessment of the composition and number of primary care teams in each health board area will be carried out within guidelines and frameworks developed by the forthcoming national primary care task force. Following the needs assessment, the task force will produce, in conjunction with the health boards, a primary care human resources plan to develop the capacity of primary care. I have not asked the national task force on medical staffing to deal directly with workforce planning for general practitioners. Its work will, however, have implications for the number of general practitioners required in the coming years. In this context, I understand that it will liaise closely with the national primary care task force. The task force on medical staffing includes a representative of the Irish College of General Practitioners.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the need to expand neurosurgical capacity. One of the key questions is whether further development should occur at the current national centre in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin or at some other centre. It is now more than ten years since Comhairle na nOspidéal last undertook a review of neurosurgical services. Given the passage of time since then, and in the light of the announcement in the recent health strategy of the Government's intention to provide an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011, I consider that an up to date review of neurosurgical services should be undertaken, focusing in particular on issues of capacity and geographic configuration. <Col N="412" /> Comhairle has been asked to give priority to carrying out such a review and to the preparation of a report for my consideration.</P>

      <P>There are 600,000 units of smallpox vaccine available for use in the event of a confirmed case of the disease. It is accepted that smallpox vaccines can be diluted by a factor of five or six and still retain satisfactory levels of efficacy. The Irish strategy in relation to smallpox vaccination is broadly based on WHO guidelines which includes the identification of persons with smallpox, the tracing of contacts and the vaccination of these groups. In the event of a case of smallpox occurring, the expert committee on contingency planning for biological threats will provide advice in relation to the management of the situation, including the issues of vaccine use and dilution based on the specific circumstances prevailing at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the different policies regarding breast screening and cervical screening it is not considered feasible for both services to be delivered simultaneously at the same centres. For example, breast screening is based on a specialised service model, either in a dedicated location or in a mobile unit for women in the 50-64 age band with a two-year screening interval using high technology equipment. All these units are equipped with the specialised equipment required to undertake breast screening and all such screening is undertaken by specialised radiographers. BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Midland Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in the target age group in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cervical screening is carried out in the primary care setting, in GP clinics and nationwide centres, and is provided to women in the 25-60 age band with a five year recall interval using relatively low technology equipment. In addition, the cervical screening programme is based on the principle of women having a choice of smear-taker. Phase one <Col N="413" /> of the National Cervical Screening Programme was launched in the Mid-Western Health Board on 16 October 2000. Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered to approximately 67,000 women, free of charge, at five-year intervals in the Mid-Western Health Board area. Under the National Health Strategy a commitment has been given to the full extension of both the cervical screening and BreastCheck programmes to the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group of 50 to 64 years. It is expected that phase one of the programme will be completed by December 2002. To date over 50,000 women have been called for screening and over 34,000 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of 70%.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance and best practice and the experience gained in phase one will facilitate the process of planning and organising the roll-out of the programme nationwide. BreastCheck is currently in discussion with health boards, including the Southern Health Board, concerning expansion of the programme nationwide. My Department will continue to support BreastCheck in moving to nationwide coverage as soon as possible.</P>

I am not aware of an over-running of western EU health systems by people from Third World countries nor have I been made aware that <Col N="416" /> entire African villages intend to travel to Ireland and other EU destinations for general health care and for giving birth with a view to future eligibility of health benefits.</P>
      <P>The health care of immigrants is addressed in the context of general arrangements governing eligibility for public health services. Eligibility for health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. In discharging its international obligations my Department, through the health boards, provides for the health care of asylum seekers. The arrangements in place for asylum seekers are not, however, subject to residency and means criteria and such persons may avail of public health services on the same basis as medical card holders while awaiting a decision on an application to remain in this country. The decision on any application to remain in this State is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is currently not available in my Department. However, the Deputy will be aware that one of the working groups established under the Good Friday Agreement to examine the area of planning for major emergencies &ndash; the cross-Border pre-hospital emergency care working group &ndash; has proposed the commissioning of an independent feasibility study on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service covering the island of Ireland. The proposal for the feasibility study was endorsed at the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on 16 November 2001.</P>
      <P>The advertisement inviting tenders for the feasibility study appeared in national newspapers on 24 January 2002. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 14 February 2002. The tenders are being evaluated at present and the successful tenderer will be appointed shortly. It is anticipated that the study will be completed by June 2002. The terms of reference for the study require the consultants to &ldquo;summarise and take account of research and evaluations, which have been carried out internationally, into the costs and benefits of a helicopter emergency medical service as against ground ambulances&rdquo;. I would anticipate that in undertaking this element of the study, the consultants would be required to collect the information requested by the Deputy, which therefore would be available in the final study.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy, which I recently launched, was published by the Neurological Alliance and is the third and final report in their Standards of Care series. This series of publications seek to address the needs and requirements of people in Ireland who suffer from a wide range of neurological conditions. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, including representatives of the Neurological Alliance, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. In April 2001, Comhairle advised my Department that it had established a committee to undertake the review with the following terms of reference: to examine the existing arrangements for the provision of consultant-level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and following consultation with the interests concerned and to make recommendations to Comhairle na nOspidéal on the future organisation and development of neurology and neurophysiology services.</P>
      <P>The review will focus on updating the 1991 Comhairle report taking into account recent advances in and increasing demand for neurological and neurophysiological services. The Comhairle review is at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly. The need for additional investment in neurology and neurophysiology services will be considered in the light of the review, other competing priorities, and the availability of adequate funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 and 305 together.</P>
      <P>The hospital in-patient waiting times and the numbers on waiting lists as at 31 December 2001 at Tullamore General Hospital, in the format collected by my Department, are being communicated separately to the Deputy. In relation to the other details requested by the Deputy, my Department has asked the chief executive officer at the Midland Health Board to look into the matter and reply directly to him.</P>
      <P>The figures supplied to my Department by the Midland Health Board show that considerable progress has been made in reducing the number of people waiting for in-patient services at Tullamore General Hospital over the last number of years. The number of people waiting for in-patient treatment at December 2001 was 1,149. This represents a decrease of 29% on the comparable figures for December 2000. The number of people waiting for orthopaedic surgery has fallen by 48% during the same period, and the number of people waiting for ENT surgery has fallen by 29%.</P>
      <P>On 15 February 2002, the Taoiseach announced that agreement has been reached to proceed with the next stage of the new hospital development at Tullamore. When complete this development will increase the bed complement at the hospital by 72. This increase in bed capacity will help to continue the work which has been done over the last number of years in reducing the in-patient waiting lists at the hospital.</P>
      <P>I also announced recently the commissioning of an additional six beds for dialysis patients at Tullamore General Hospital in the current year. This represents an additional investment for the hospital of &euro;0.485 million. These new public beds are part of the first phase of the provision of additional acute hospital beds as announced in the health strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding severe shortages of qualified therapy personnel, including speech and language therapists, that are seriously affecting the provision of key therapy services nationwide my Department commissioned the report referred to by the Deputy, &ldquo;Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists&rdquo;, from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates.</P>
      <P>The Bacon Report which was published in July 2001 concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term requirements of the health service. The report, therefore, advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve the fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>To advance this core recommendation of the report an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the Bacon Report. The proposals received are currently being assessed by the inter-agency working group with a view to early progress in the provision of the extra training places required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress, to date, in relation to other key recommendations included in the Bacon Report are as follows: the planned establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators to support the provision of additional clinical placements; concerted overseas recruitment of <Col N="423" /> scarce therapy personnel undertaken on behalf of all the health boards by the Northern Area Health Board; the establishment of the health skills group under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to support the development of integrated workforce planning and improved human resource planning in the health service; the ongoing implementation of the report of the expert group on various health professions to address outstanding issues including workload, working practices and skills-mix issues highlighted in the Bacon Report; and the preparation of a scheme for the statutory registration for health and social care professionals, consistent with the requirement for a person-centred health service.</P>

It is chaired by Dr. Desmond O'Neill, Consultant Physician in Medicine of Old Age. The terms of reference of the working group are to advise on the development of principles, policies and guidelines in relation to the implementation of appropriate structures to deal with elder abuse.</P>
      <P>The group drew up a comprehensive work programme which involved, <i>inter alia</i>, development of a training brief, the organisation of pilot projects, implementation of awareness and training programmes and preparation of an evaluation report, culminating in the presentation of a final report. The group is on target to have its work finalised by 30 June this year.</P>

This information consists of a &ldquo;list&rdquo; of workers, paid employees and volunteers, who have been dismissed, transferred to other work, or have resigned in circumstances where it is considered they posed a risk to children or adults with learning disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No such lists or registers of people deemed unsafe or unsuitable to work with children or vulnerable adults are kept in the Republic of Ireland. It is my understanding that to introduce such a register would present significant legal and constitutional difficulties. However, this is not to say that vetting of workers is not available here. My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has informed me that a central vetting unit has been recently established in the Garda Síochána in response to requests for enhanced clearance system for employment with children and vulnerable young adults. The Garda central vetting unit's primary role is to check prospective employees who as part of their duties will have substantial access to children or vulnerable adults. The unit liaises with the various <Col N="427" /> health boards throughout the country in this regard and is currently developing an enhanced employee clearance system with the objective of meeting growing demands in this area.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that there is ongoing co-operation between the police forces of both jurisdictions in this area and the Garda central vetting unit liaises on a daily basis with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in relation to checks on prospective health board employees who have been domiciled in Northern Ireland. Equally the Police Service of Northern Ireland liaises with the Garda central vetting unit regarding applicants for positions in Northern Ireland who have been domiciled in this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware when I visited Monaghan General Hospital recently I met hospital management and staff and representatives of local groups. I was happy to be in a position to allay any concerns with regard to the future development of the hospital.</P>
      <P>A significant level of capital investment in Monaghan General Hospital is proposed in the short-term; plans are being advanced by the North-Eastern Health Board for development and upgrading the high dependency unit at the hospital in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the development of the treatment-minor injuries unit and the development of a midwifery led unit. The associated capital cost is of the order of &euro;7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue funding is provided to health boards for the maintenance and continued development of existing services and for the provision and development of new services. Revenue funding in this regard has been provided to the North-East<Col N="428" /> ern Health Board in recent years as follows: 2000 £226.806 million; 2001 £289.122 million.</P>
    <P>In the current year this figure increased to &euro;450.053 million, £354.446 million.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the health board to determine its service priorities in the context of the funding made available to it for the maintenance, development and provision of services. I am advised by the board that the development of new consultant-led services in dermatology and geriatric medicine at the hospital is proceeding and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has recently issued formal approval to the board for the filling of two consultant posts to facilitate these developments. A further application for approval of the upgrading of a temporary consultant surgeon post to permanent status is currently being progressed by my Department. I regard these developments as evidence of the commitment of the board to continued investment in the development of services on the hospital campus.</P>
    <P>I am further advised by the board that management consultants have been retained to oversee the implementation of a consultants in management programme for the NEHB hospitals and to improve and enhance general management arrangements for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group.</P>
    <P>I have announced the immediate commissioning process for an additional 709 acute hospital beds in public hospitals nation-wide at a cost of &euro;65 million in the current year. This is the first phase in the provision of the additional 3,000 acute hospital beds by 2011. Some 38 of the additional 709 public hospital beds will be provided in the North-Eastern Health Board region with ten of these being provided in Monaghan General Hospital. All of the additional bed capacity at the hospital will be designated for public patients and will allow the hospital to significantly increase activity levels for its public patients.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the proposed development of additional consultant-led services at the hospital, together with the provision of additional bed capacity and the proposed significant level of capital investment is tangible evidence of additional funding for the provision of acute hospital services to the catchment area population served by the hospital.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the <Col N="429" /> long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness &ndash; for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to amend to include persons with polio.</P>
      <P>People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the homeless are a high risk <Col N="432" /> group in relation to a number of health conditions, including mental illness.</P>
      <P>The main difficulty in relation to adult homelessness has been in the Dublin area and, in order to address this, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has appointed a director of homelessness who is working closely with the three area health boards in implementing the provisions of &ldquo;Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy&rdquo; (May 2000).</P>
      <P>The work of the three area health boards includes measures to improve mental health services for people who are homeless. At present, there are 35 community accommodation places available within the Eastern region for homeless mentally ill requiring varying levels of support in the community. The homeless psychiatric service also has access to sheltered accommodation in the Granby Centre and with Focus housing. The homeless mentally ill can also access places in emergency beds and transitional beds where their illness is stabilised.</P>
      <P>There is no policy among service providers to exclude anybody with a mental illness from its services. It is the case, however, that those homeless people with ongoing behavioural problems, particularly as they relate to alcohol or drugs, may be excluded from some accommodation provision.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the health strategy, officials from my Department have been involved in conjunction with officials from other Departments in the preparation of the Homeless Preventative Strategy, which was published recently. The strategy is designed to prevent homelessness among those leaving institutional care, who may be at risk. The strategy provides guidance to health boards to ensure procedures and policies are in place to further reduce the risk of people leaving institutional care becoming homeless.</P>

      <P>When launching the policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, on 4 March, I stated that a national ban on landfilling of specific materials would be introduced this year. Such a ban would, in the first instance, address materials which are readily recyclable, for example, glass, paper, aluminium and elements of the construction and demolition waste stream.</P>
      <P>The introduction of any such ban will be considered in the context of related initiatives which are currently under way. For example, a task force established by my Department is reviewing the Waste Management (Packaging Regulations), 1997 and the outcome of this review is expected to reform commercial packaging waste management. In the context of the implementation of the Task Force on Construction and Demolition Waste, I have also declared my intention to ban the landfilling of unsegregated construction and demolition waste. Action in this regard will be advanced in parallel to the work of the proposed National Construction and Demolition Waste Council which is shortly to be established. The banning of tyres from landfills will arise in future years under the EU landfill directive.</P>

    <P>My Department has been in dialogue with the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA) and a proposal has been submitted by the association for a <Col N="439" /> producer responsibility initiative for waste tyres. This is being examined at present and my Department will respond to the ITIA in the near future.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have powers under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, to acquire, by agreement or compulsorily, sites which are derelict within the meaning of the Act.</P>
      <P>South Dublin County Council, having received an objection to the compulsory acquisition of the site in question, submitted an application on 24 August 1998 requesting my consent to its acquisition under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990. The council subsequently advised that it had refused planning permission for the site in February 1999. This decision was appealed to An Bord Pleanála who refused permission for the development on 14 October 1999. Having considered the application and the report of the inspector who examined the site I granted my consent on 23 February 2000 to the acquisition of the property by South Dublin County Council in accordance with my statutory functions. The administration of the order is a matter for the council who may, by vesting order, acquire the site. My Department has no further function in the matter.</P>

      <P>A copy of this motion has been received in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consent of the local authority is required to the first resale of a local authority dwelling sold under the tenant purchase scheme. Prior to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, the consent of the local authority was required to each resale of such houses. However, this requirement for the formal consent of the local authority to each subsequent resale was causing unnecessary delays and uncertainty in the sale and purchase of dwellings, many of which would not have been in local authority ownership for some years. In addition, in the case of any subsequent resale, the vendor would have paid the full market price for the property at the time of acquisition. Accordingly, it was con<Col N="441" /> sidered inappropriate for the local authority to have a role in consenting to subsequent transactions relating to such properties. I, therefore, do not propose to amend the legislation as suggested.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department has issued any directive to local authorities outlining the percentage or mix of social housing within a private development, as permitted under the Planning and Development Act, 2000; if such housing applies only to zoned land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, each planning authority is required to develop a housing strategy to take account of all the housing needs of its area, including those for social and affordable housing. The authority then determines the percentage &ndash; up to a maximum of 20% &ndash; of land zoned for residential use, or for a mix of residential and other uses, which is to be reserved to meet the identified need for social and affordable housing. Authorities may decide to apply different percentages to different areas, subject to not exceeding 20%, or the general percentage specified in the housing strategy, if this is lower.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for planning authorities on Part V of the Act, and the preparation of housing strategies along with a model housing strategy were issued by my Department in December 2000. While the guidelines set out the factors to be considered by planning authorities in the preparation of their housing strategies, including a requirement to set out local social and affordable housing policies and to ensure mixed and balanced developments, they did not specify a particular percentage for the social housing element, as under the Act this is a matter for each local authority. The model housing strategy, using Louth as the model county, describes a methodology for calculating the extent of social and affordable housing need. In utilising Part V, planning authorities have been advised to maximise the extent to which needs can be met by the provision of affordable housing.</P>

      <P>All local authorities were requested in 1994 to investigate the potential to promote and harness community support for certain non-national road works in their areas and guidelines for this purpose were set out in circular RW 4/94 from my Department. Local <Col N="444" /> authorities have subsequently been reminded each year in the context of the notification of non-national road grant allocations that they should continue to seek such involvement in improvement and maintenance work in suitable non-national roads.</P>
      <P>No specific funding is allocated for the community involvement scheme, however, local authorities may reserve a portion of the discretionary grant allocation for eligible schemes. Furthermore, as set out in circular RW 6/99, up to 75% of a county council's restoration programme grants may be set aside for community involvement schemes in cases where local contributions &ndash; in money or in kind &ndash; meet not less than 25% of the total cost of a project.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information currently available to my Department, details of the local authorities who have been operating projects under the community involvement scheme are set out in the following table. I am satisfied also that the significantly increased level of State funding provided in recent years, supplemented by county councils' own resources &ndash; including the community involvement scheme &ndash; is providing adequately for the ongoing maintenance and improvement needs of the non-national road network and will assist in its systematic and accelerated improvement.</P>

In accordance with my Department's procurement policy for water services projects and the provisions of EU Directive 93/38/EEC, and amending Directive 98/4/EC-Annex XII-B-Restricted Procedure, the council invited pre-qualification submissions from contractors for the design, construction and operation, by way of single contract, of water treatment facilities for a number of group and public water supply schemes in the county.</P>
      <P>As provided for under the directives, Monaghan County Council required applicant contractors to meet certain criteria with regard to financial and economic standing, technical knowledge and ability to undertake the contract, and to produce evidence of the availability of a performance bond in respect of both capital and operational elements of the contract. Having regard to the overall scope and value of the contract, which has a projected whole life cost in the region of &euro;30 million, applicants were required to have realised a turnover of £15 million, &euro;19.05 million, cumulatively over the previous three years, and installed, in at least five water treatment plants, mechanical and electrical processes to the value of not less than £300,000, &euro;380,000, in each case.</P>
      <P>Nine valid applications for pre-qualification were received by the council, five of which were shortlisted and invited to tender for the contract. Valid tenders were received from four companies, three of which were Irish based. The successful tenderer was Irish based.</P>

      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the legislative provisions which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid and the means test which must be applied. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser, the age of the person and on the income of the individual and his-her dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement payable in any individual case was put in place in 1996. The various types of prescribed diets are grouped into two categories, one comprising lower cost diets and the other comprising higher cost diets. For the purposes of calculating the rate of diet supplement payable, the lower cost diets were deemed to cost &euro;34.28 <Col N="449" /> per week and the higher cost diets were deemed to cost &euro;44.44 per week. In the case of a lower cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is &euro;34.28 less one third of the applicant's income &ndash; one sixth in the case of a couple. In the case of a higher cost diet, the amount of diet supplement payable is &euro;44.44 less one third of the applicant's income &ndash; one sixth in the case of a couple. Increases in weekly social welfare payment rates since 1996 are disregarded for the purposes of this means test as they would have the effect of reducing the rate of diet supplement payable in all cases and would eliminate entitlement altogether in many cases.</P>
    <P>In the case of children under the age of 18 there is a standard rate of &euro;10.16 per week for a higher cost diet and &euro;6.35 per week for a lower cost diet. In the case of persons with dependent children the child dependants' allowance is not assessed.</P>
    <P>All aspects of the diet supplement will be examined in conjunction with the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently under way as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. I have no immediate plans to amend any aspect of the diet supplement pending receipt of the review group's recommendations on the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of one parent family payment from my Department. She is also in contact with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which, as the Deputy will know, is funded by my Department. In addition, she has received assistance in the form of exceptional needs payments from her local community welfare officer under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. She has requested additional assistance with meeting mortgage costs but has been found to be not entitled to this under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. That scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test. Mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less &euro;7.62. This &euro;7.62 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;7.62 towards their mortgage interest because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their mortgage interest costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Northern Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the individual in question and has advised that when she first applied for a mortgage interest supplement in November 1999 her application was refused on the grounds of means. The accommodation in respect of which the application was made was jointly owned by herself and her former partner. In addition to paying half the mortgage her former partner was also paying her maintenance of £35 per week, equivalent to £151.66 per month. This is assessed as being towards her half of the mortgage, in accordance with the standard arrangements governing supplementary welfare allowance. At that time the total mortgage interest was £330 per month. The individual in question was liable for half that <Col N="452" /> amount but her income from her lone parent payment and the maintenance from her former partner meant that she was deemed to have sufficient means to meet her mortgage interest liability.</P>
    <P>She has applied for a mortgage interest supplement on two further occasions, firstly in July 2000 and again in December 2001. The position in relation to her entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement remains unchanged in so far as her income level is deemed to be sufficient to meet her portion of the mortgage interest costs. While the individual's application for a mortgage interest supplement has been unsuccessful, she has been given assistance under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme by way of three exceptional needs payments which issued in December 2001 in connection with outstanding bills.</P>
    <P>The board has further advised that a copy of the letter which accompanied the Deputy's question was sent by the individual concerned to her local health centre. The superintendent of community welfare is currently trying to arrange a meeting with the various interested parties in order to see if there is any further assistance that can be given to help alleviate the difficulties currently being experienced by the individual in question.</P>

According to my Department's records the person concerned has a total of 25 paid contributions. Accordingly, he would not qualify for old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has not made an application for old age contributory pension. He is currently in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension at the maximum weekly personal rate of &euro;134.00.

      <P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 30 March 2001. The principal conditions for receipt of disability allowance are that the medical eligibility criteria are met and that the means test which applies is satisfied. While she satisfied the medical criteria for award of disability allowance the means of the person concerned, which were derived from her partner's self employment, were in excess of the statutory limit. Accordingly her claim was refused. She appealed this decision but the appeals officer upheld the original decision. An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive in the absence of any fresh facts or evidence.

      <P>Civil servants appointed before 5 April 1995 pay social insurance contributions at a reduced rate giving cover for a limited range of benefits including widows-widowers contributory pension, orphans payments, limited occupational injuries benefits, bereavement grant and carer's benefit. They are not insured for old age contributory or retirement pensions. Similar arrangements apply to many other public servants appointed before the date in question.</P>
      <P>Civil servants were not insured at the full rate because it was considered that their conditions of employment and their occupational pension arrangements made adequate provision for their old age and other contingencies, such as unemployment and sickness, normally covered under full rate social insurance contributions. Civil servants appointed on or after the 5 April 1995 do pay social insurance contributions at the full rate, which gives entitlement to contributory pensions. However, changes have been made to their occupational pensions which are now integrated with the social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say how many people who paid modified rate insurance are refused pension each year. However, it is thought that the number refused is small as, generally speaking, the people concerned do not submit applications.</P>
      <P>It is tentatively estimated by the Department of Finance that there are about 50,000 former public servants who paid modified insurance contributions receiving public service pensions at present. Many of these may not yet have reached the qualifying age for social welfare old age pensions and others may be receiving social welfare pensions. In this connection, I understand former public servants who made full rate contributions at the beginning of their working lives are one of the groups benefiting from the pre-53 pension which I introduced in May 2000.</P>
      <P>In the absence of accurate information on the ages of existing public service pensioners or their current status <i>vis-à-vis</i> the social welfare system it is not possible to give an estimated cost of providing them with contributory pensions.</P>

      <P>The free travel pass issued by my Department does not contain a photograph of the customer. However, it is long-standing practice that passholders resident in the main urban centres must obtain a subsidiary photo-identity card from CIE in order to use CIE Group services in those areas. This identity card is obtainable by free travel clients at CIE offices in exchange for a tear-off voucher attached to the pass. The cost of this is met by the Department.</P>
      <P>Any misuse of the free travel pass by ineligible persons results in a loss to the transport operators by way of lost fares and the Department supports any initiative to address this. There are no immediate plans to implement a system of photo-identity travel passes directly, though this position is being kept under review in the context of the development of policy in relation to public service cards generally. Developments in other jurisdictions in this regard will also be taken into account. In the meantime my Department supports in principle the development by transport operators of more secure arrangements to prevent or detect any misuse, and is supportive of recent moves in this regard by the CIE Group in particular.</P>

      <P>My Department operates <Col N="459" /> a number of long-term funding programmes, the purpose of which is to provide core funding for groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities. The funding provided for the community development support programmes in 2002 amounts to some &euro;27.65 million and represents an increase of &euro;4.67million on funding made available to the programmes in 2001.</P>
      <P>In general, core funding provided under my Department's community development support programmes provides for the employment of a maximum of two full time staff equivalent together with the administration and general operating costs of the project. The additional funding secured by my Department in recent years has allowed for the approval of substantial increases in core funding to all projects funded under the community development support programmes.</P>
      <P>In the 1998 budget, an allocation of £300,000 was made available for projects funded under the community development programme specifically to apply for additional time limited funding for work, usually to cover the employment costs of a worker, necessary to the effectiveness of the programme but not otherwise resourced at that time. This enhanced funding scheme operated from 1998 to 2000 during which time a total of &euro;4.475 million, including commitments for 2001-02, has been committed to projects. All funding commitments previously approved under this scheme have been met by my Department.</P>
      <P>No new applications for funding or applications for continued funding of existing posts under the enhanced funding scheme were invited in 2001 pending a review of the scheme. This review has been completed and is currently under consideration by my Department. While a decision regarding the future operation of the scheme has yet to be determined, I emphasise that all existing funding commitments will be honoured.</P>

      <P>The Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, provides for the regulation of coursing by greyhounds and designates the Irish Coursing Club as the controlling body for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds, subject to the control and direction of Bord na gCon. This Act is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. However, licences are issued by me under sections 32 and 34 of the Wildlife Acts, 1976 and 2000, which enables the Irish Coursing Club and their affiliated clubs to net and earmark hares which are a protected species under the Wildlife Acts. Conservation rangers attached to my Department carry out spot checks on a number of coursing club meetings to ensure that the terms and conditions attached to the licences are adhered to.</P>
      <P>The number of hare kills recorded by Dúchas conservation rangers at 45 coursing meetings attended for the 2000-01 season was 49. The equivalent figure at 40 coursing meetings attended for the 2001-02 season was 31. As requested by the Deputy, the number of kills recorded for each of the two seasons, and the number of kills recorded at each meeting, are set out in the following tables.</P>
      <P>In relation to the data actually recorded by Dúchas conservation rangers, I am satisfied the data is recorded on a bona fide basis and reflects the information available to the ranger in attendance at the time. At the end of each season a table of data, including kills, is prepared and copies are provided to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and to the Irish Coursing Club for information. Meetings are also held each year with these parties to review the coursing season and to discuss any issues which may arise from this data.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have provided details to this House on a number of occasions, most recently by way of reply to Question No. 144 of 4 Deireadh Fómhair 2001, in regard to consultants employed by my Department in respect of a range of projects coming within its remit. However, it appears from the Deputy's question that the information being sought by him related only to consultants or other persons employed for the purposes of carrying out of functions normally performed, or capable of being formed, by civil servants or by special advisers within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. Accordingly, I have asked my Department to identify such consultants or persons, if any, and to forward the details to the Deputy as soon as possible. In light of the amount of information to be checked, it has not been possible to deal with the matter within the time frame set for the reply of parliamentary questions.</P>

      <P>Funding of the core activities of organisations such as the Ark, and the conditions attaching to such funding, fall to the Arts Council, which, although funded by my Department, operates independently of and separately from my Department when taking funding decisions. However, my Department has sanctioned capital grant aid of £1 million for specific works being undertaken by The Ark Children's Cultural Centre Limited, as follows:&ndash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Healing Ark: &ndash; A schedule of work to support the development of aesthetic environments and arts experiences in Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals which will include outdoor courtyards, murals, furniture, <Col N="465" /> signage and artist workstations for visiting the wards.</P>
    <P>The Virtual Ark: &ndash; An arts-based web project, with and for children.</P>
    <P>The Ark Mobile: &ndash; An outreach programme to tour the country for which materials and equipment are being purchased.</P>
    <P>Arts Links: &ndash; The refurbishment and conversion of two flats in Fatima Mansions into a children's art studio and outdoor physical features.</P>
    <P>Of the above, the Healing Ark is designed to cater for all children in the hospital settings, and while there will be some elements of the Virtual Ark that require hearing, it will largely be accessible to and very suitable for deaf children. I also understand from the Ark that the theatre in Temple Bar is equipped with a system that facilitates the effective use of hearing aids at performances, and that theatre staff are more than willing to, and regularly do, work with special needs groups, including the deaf or hearing impaired, to ensure that the children visiting the Ark are facilitated to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>It has been my policy to make all of the visitor centres operated by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, as accessible as possible to all visitors. The general matter of video usage at visitor centres is under review by my Department. The technology for service delivery is also changing. Many of our sites use video technology that is rapidly becoming obsolete and DVD offers prospects for the conversion of some older presentations. Given the wide range of alternative technologies currently available my Department has recently set up an internal committee to examine the issue and to recommend the most appropriate method(s) of technology my Department should adopt.</P>
      <P>One outcome may be that my Department will use fewer video shows in the future and that much of what we will use will be more closely integrated into the interpretative displays themselves. Issues such as subtitling or sign language inserts will be addressed in the context of the decision on the new technology.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous reply of 30 January 2002 regarding legal fees paid in my Department in 1999, 2000 and 2001. The Deputy will wish to note two adjustments to the figures provided for 2001.</P>
      <P>(i) My previous reply had included the amount of &euro;12,697 inclusive of settlement to Hegarty and Hogan Solicitors. It has since been confirmed that the Department did not pay any legal costs or expenses in this case and was only a settlement.</P>
      <P>(ii) It has also been brought to my attention that a payment, in November 2001, to C.M.S. Cameron McKenna, for &euro;29,041.46, was omitted from the previous figures provided. This payment was in respect of work carried out on behalf of the National Museum of Ireland for the recovery of two Waterford cannons.</P>

      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy in response to earlier parliamentary questions, proposals for the provision of visitor facilities are still at an early stage. One of <Col N="467" /> the objectives for my Department in 2002 in relation to Castletown House is to finalise the designs for these visitor facilities. However, it is not yet feasible at this stage to give an indication as to when the final plans can be drawn up and submitted for planning application. I am confident such facilities will greatly enhance the attraction of this historic property as a tourist destination.</P>

Section 22 of the Act also provides that during a period of additional maternity leave under section 14 of the Act an employee is not entitled to remuneration from her employer.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 400 and 401 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" />The original Schengen Agreement was concluded in 1985 with the intention of creating an area of free movement within a single secure external border by shifting the emphasis from internal to external border controls. Under a protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty, the Schengen <i>acquis</i>, including the Agreement, was incorporated into the EU framework. This Protocol, the Schengen Protocol, does not bind Ireland or the UK but provides that either or both can opt in, at any time, to part or all of the <i>acquis</i>.</P>
    <P>Following the incorporation of Schengen into the EU framework, the UK applied in May 1999 to participate in elements of the Schengen <i>acquis </i>including police co-operation, mutual assistance in criminal matters, narcotic drugs, and the Schengen Information System. As UK policy is to maintain its own external border controls with the rest of Europe, the UK did not seek to participate in the aspects of Schengen which concern border controls.</P>
    <P>Ireland's request to participate in some of the provisions of the Schengen <i>acquis</i>, adopted at the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 February 2002, was similar in scope to the UK's application. Ireland, like the UK, will not participate in the aspects of the Schengen <i>acquis </i>relating to the abolition of border controls and free movement of persons. Ireland's position in this regard is subject to maintaining the Common Travel Area with the UK which has been in existence for many years. Ireland will be participating in discussions on further amendments and additions to the Schengen <i>acquis</i>, only in those areas of the <i>acquis </i>in which it has sought to participate.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): My ongoing commitment to the care of crime victims continues to be reflected in the significant funding of almost &euro;4.5 million which I have made available to Victim Support over the past four years. As regards continued improvements in the position of victims, I have to say that the work of Victim Support is critical to my policy of victim care. In this regard, it will shortly undertake, in cooperation with my Department, a review of its strategic policy and direction, the results of which are expected within a few months.</P>
    <P>I have always stated that I wish to give victims of crime a central place in the criminal justice system. As part of this continuing strategy, I will shortly be embarking on a review of the victims charter which I published in 1999. The review will ensure that the standards of victim care enshrined in the charter are being fully implemented in practice and that any suggestions or recommendations in victim care arising from the review will be appropriately reflected in new legislative or administrative initiatives.</P>

      <P>Article 9.3 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons provides that the enforcement of the sentence upon transfer shall be governed by the law of the administering State, namely the receiving State, and that that State alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions in this regard. This includes, for instance, the rules relating to remission and eligibility for conditional release.</P>
      <P>Article 13 of the Convention provides that the sentencing State alone shall have the right to decide on any application for review of the judgment. Ireland accepted this article when the convention was ratified in July 1995 and there is no other review condition in the convention which Ireland has yet to sign. The explanatory report of the convention states that the exclusive competence of the sentencing State to review the judgment is justified by the fact that, technically speaking, review proceedings are not part of enforcement of sentence.</P>

      <Quest>the initiatives he plans to pursue in relation to addressing the issue of under age drinking which is so prevalent in small rural and large urban centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9835/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): Although criminal and civil legislative measures have an important role to play in addressing the issue of under age drinking, it should be noted that a much broader-based response is required, involving a range of State agencies, the drinks industry, the creative media and, in particular, parents. For my part, I introduced the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which represents a considerable strengthening of the law in relation to under-age drinking. It increased fines for breaches of the law on under-age drinking, abolished the defence of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; in any proceedings against the licensee and made provision for a new penalty &ndash; a temporary closure order &ndash; for conviction of the sale of alcohol to underage persons. Of the 184 prosecutions taken under the Act for the period 30 June 2000, to the 11 February 2002, closure orders were obtained in 82 cases.</P>
    <P>The national voluntary age card scheme, which I introduced by way of statutory regulations in April 1999, is designed to complement such legislative initiatives. Its purpose is to provide evidence of age where a doubt exists, and the scheme is intended for persons who have already attained 18 years of age and who are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises and who wish to do so. I am pleased to report that, to date, approximately 52,000 age cards have been issued, of which approximately 30,000 were processed last year. To further promote the take-up of age cards, I recently secured the sum of &euro;150,000 in Budget 2002 for an awareness raising campaign in relation to the national scheme, the details of which will be announced in due course.</P>

    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): Since its inception in 1996 and up to 31 December 2000 the Criminal Assets Bureau has secured freezing orders with a view to seizing criminal assets with a combined total value in excess of &euro;19 million. Taxes and interest demanded are in excess of &euro;47 million. In addition, social welfare overpayments assessed, and savings projected, are over &euro;2 million.</P>
    <P>Details of the actions taken by the Criminal Assets Bureau in 2001 will be included in the Criminal Assets Bureau annual report 2001, which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in due course, in accordance with the provisions of section 21 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996. Section 4 of the Proceeds of <Col N="489" /> Crime Act, 1996 provides for the disposal of property frozen where an interlocutory order has been in force for not less than seven years. At the end of this period the High Court may make a disposal order directing that the property be transferred to the Minister for Finance or to such person as the court may determine. No freezing order secured by the bureau in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, has yet been in force for seven years.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that investigations are ongoing into a reported incident of intimidation of five persons at Rassan, Hackballscross, County Louth on 30 May 2001. It would not be appropriate to make any further comment while the investigation is in progress.</P>
      <P>In relation to Garda powers in such cases, the statutory offence of &lsquo;coercion' was created by section 9 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997. The offence arises where, with a view to compel another from doing or to do any act which that other has a lawful right to do or abstain from doing, a person uses violence or intimidates that other person or a member of the family of the other person. This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years on conviction on indictment.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have informed me that they consider this legislation sufficient to deal with such cases. Any cases of paramilitary activity which are brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána are fully investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point that must be made is that the term immigrant applies to a widely divergent group of persons from various social and economic backgrounds who are present in the State at any one time for different purposes. It includes short-term visitors, students, immigrant workers and business people, retired people who wish to see out their days in the State, refugees and asylum seekers. It comprises United Kingdom nationals who have been coming here for many years, nationals of European Economic Area countries who have in large part free movement entitlements, persons from developed countries such as the United States and persons from poorer countries. The vast majority of such persons are legally present in the State but there is <Col N="495" /> no doubt that, as is the case with most developed countries, a certain number are here illegally also.</P>
      <P>Obviously the needs of such persons vary greatly depending on their individual circumstances. In many instances, those needs would have more in common with Irish citizens of a similar socio-economic background than they would with other categories of non-nationals. It would be wrong to view all such persons as a separate generic group whose need for the services of various Government Departments and agencies can be neatly pigeonholed and limited to a couple of common themes. Consequently the provision of public services to immigrants is generally handled as part of the mainstream provision of services. This is an appropriate way to proceed in a country the size of Ireland, and is more likely to encourage integration than the provision of a separate service to immigrants.</P>
      <P>The Government is well aware that the development of immigration policy and the delivery of an immigration service in line with that policy involves the interests of a number of Government Departments and agencies. For this reason there is a Cabinet committee chaired by an Taoiseach which meets regularly to advance that policy. In addition of course there is a senior Minister who sits at the Cabinet table, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has the key role in co-ordinating those interests and ensuring delivery of that service.</P>
      <P>I have given priority attention to this task during my time in office and the Government's acknowledgement of the importance of that role is evidenced by the large increase in staff numbers which have been allocated to the asylum and immigration area of my Department. I have, for example, with Government approval, established a cross-departmental team &ndash; the Reception and Integration Agency &ndash; to co-ordinate the provision of services for asylum seekers and refugees and implement an integration policy for refugees. Staff have been seconded to the agency by the Departments of Health and Children, Environment and Local Government, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science and by health boards, local authorities, the Defence Forces and the Irish Red Cross. In addition, I have appointed an interim advisory board to the agency. The board comprises representatives of Government Departments with responsibilities for asylum seekers and refugees and representatives of the wider community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have established an equality infrastructure to underpin our anti-discrimination legislation, that is, the Equality Authority and the Office of Director of Equality Investigations. They provide free advice and redress to those who have suffered racial discrimination. I established the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism which has been instrumental in drawing together key Government bodies and NGO groups to address racism. I established a High Level Steering Group to implement the <Col N="496" /> Government's national anti-racism awareness programme comprising, <i>inter alia</i>, representatives of ethnic minority communities and the social partners as well as representatives from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Education and Science, Social Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children and my own Department. I have initiated an inclusive framework for the development of immigration policy in the context of the development of new immigration legislation which comprehends: (<i>a</i>) a cross-departmental group on immigration to co-ordinate Department's approaches in this area; (<i>b</i>) a public consultation process on immigration policy which has already taken place; and (<i>c</i>) a study of international legislation and practice in the field of immigration.</P>
    <P>Over and above all that there is daily interaction between staff in my Department and staff in other Departments and agencies regarding problems in individual cases. Consequently any misguided notion that the challenges faced by the State in terms of immigration, which are no different to those being faced by every other member state of the European Union, are down to a lack of co-ordination between Departments is clearly without foundation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular position of non nationals who are the victims of crime, such persons are entitled to avail of the services provided by members of the Garda Síochána in the same way that an Irish citizen is entitled to avail of those services. In that context it should be borne in mind that all student and probationer gardaí receive instruction in the area of race relations as part of their education and training programme. There are of course particular aspects of trans-national organised crime such as trafficking in persons and exploitation, which on the basis of the experience in other countries, are associated with particular classes of non national victims. This was one of the reasons that the Government approved the establishment of the Garda National Immigration Bureau in May 2000 and I can assure the Deputy that the resources necessary to protect and uphold the rights and interests of such persons are provided.</P>

      <P>The Reception and Integration Agency is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision which was introduced in April 2000. In order to meet the accommodation needs of asylum seekers, the RIA assesses the potential of accommodation offers throughout the State on an ongoing <Col N="497" /> basis. The RIA is currently providing full board accommodation for close on 5,000 asylum seekers in 81 centres which are situated in 24 of the 26 counties. Currently the RIA has three centres in South Tipperary which accommodate 55 persons on a full board basis under the system of direct provision. The RIA has advised me that it has no plans at present to disperse asylum seekers to any new facilities in south Tipperary.</P>

      <P>The visa application in question was refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of a visit visa. In particular it was felt that the applicant had not displayed sufficient evidence of her obligations to return home following her proposed visit.</P>
      <P>Although the applicant's stated purpose of journey was that of a visit, reference was made in the letter of invitation from her reference in Ireland to his intention that they be married during her stay here. However, no evidence of the arrangements made in this regard was submitted with the application. It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal of the visa application by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department together with additional supporting documentation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Reception and Integration Agency is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision which was introduced in April 2000. The RIA is currently providing full board accommodation for close on 5,000 asylum seekers in 81 centres which are situated in 24 of the 26 counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently 89 asylum seekers are accommodated in one centre in Kilkenny on a full board basis under the system of direct provision. In accordance with Government policy on the dispersal and the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers, the Office of Public Works aris<Col N="498" /> ing from a public advertisement, have recently secured a four year, nine month lease, effective from the completion of construction, for a site at Leggettsrath, Dublin Road, Kilkenny on behalf of the RIA. The site will be used for the purpose of developing a centre for the provision of accommodation and certain ancillary services for up to 250 asylum seekers, including children.</P>
    <P>An order under Section 181(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, was subsequently signed by me. I understand that arrangements are being made by the Office of Public Works to put in place the contract for the construction of the facility. I am advised that the RIA is making arrangements to meet representatives of local residents prior to the commencement of the site works and no development work will take place until these discussions have been completed.</P>
    <P>The facility in question will be a low-rise accommodation centre, modelled on similar facilities used extensively throughout Europe. It will be similar to other system built centres at Knockalisheen, County Clare, Cork and Dublin and it is anticipated that the centre could come on stream at the end of this year or early next year. Following its completion, placements to the centre will be made on a phased basis over a number of months.</P>
    <P>The centre will cater, in the main, for families and will incorporate dining, communal, recreational, health and welfare facilities and appropriate landscaping works. In accordance with normal practice, representatives of the RIA have already met with representatives of Kilkenny County Council, the South-Eastern Health Board and local residents and will liaise with support service providers, including the South-Eastern Health Board, schools and voluntary groups in order to facilitate the development of support structures for asylum seekers to be accommodated at the centre.</P>
    <P>The current rate of new applications for refugee status is approximately 800 per month, and the provision of accommodation and ancillary health and welfare facilities for them continues to be a major challenge for the State. The development of an accommodation centre at Kilkenny is in line with Government policy to meet this challenge and is part of the overall strategy for the provision of up to 4,000 places in system built accommodation throughout the State over time.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, administered by my Department, provides financial assistance to organisations, including national governing bodies of sport such as the Irish Underwater Council, for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities. The programme is advertised annually and applications for funding from clubs and organisations have to be made on an individual basis. The sports capital programme for 2002 was advertised on 25 and 26 November 2001 with a closing date of 4 January 2002 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,350 applications were received before the closing date. An application was submitted by the Irish Underwater Council to the programme but was not in relation to the provision of the hyperbaric chamber and did not refer to this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applications to the 2002 programme are currently being evaluated against its assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment <Col N="504" /> process has been completed. Consequently, a meeting with the Irish Underwater Council at this stage would not serve any useful purpose. It is intended that the 2003 sports capital programme will be advertised towards the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Grants totalling &euro;63.49 million have been sanctioned since 1997 to date, for the redevelopment of Croke Park, &euro;25.4 million of which was allocated in the budget of 1998, &euro;19.05 million of which was allocated in 2001 to ensure that Croke Park will be ready to host the Special Olympics World Games 2003 and a further &euro;19.05 million recently sanctioned.</P>
      <P>The payments to date covering the allocations are as follows: £7,000,000, &euro;8,888,167, paid in December 1998; £7,000,000, &euro;8,888,167, paid in September 1999; £5,000,000, &euro;6,348,690, paid in March 2000; £1,000,000, &euro;1.269,738, paid in December 2000; £7,500,000, &euro;9,523,035, paid in September 2001; and &euro;8,571,000, £675,000, paid in January 2002. The Deputy should note, in line with my Department's procedures for sports capital funding, 5% of the total payment of each grant allocation is retained pending the receipt of certification of completion of the defects liability period of the project. Accordingly, a final payment of &euro;95,230 is still due for payment in relation to the certification required for the &euro;19.05 million allocation made in 2001. Arrangements are currently being made for the payment of the most recently sanctioned grant of &euro;19.05 million in accordance with the normal procedures for the payment of such grants.</P>

    <P>Holding particular legal qualifications or experience was not a requirement for the above positions.</P>
    <P>On 9 February 1998 the Government established an independent inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming and appointed Dr. Roderick Murphy SC to carry out the inquiry. Ms Fidelma Macken SC acted as counsel to the inquiry and Ms Mary Cooney was solicitor to the inquiry. The inquiry completed its report on 27 May 1998 and the report was published by the Oireachtas on 17 June 1998. The costs associated with the work of the inquiry, including remuneration, were met by the office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>My Department has commissioned a number of consultancies since July 1997 to provide various services. However, as legal qualifications or experience were not requirements for any of these consultancies I am not in a position to say if any of the persons contracted to the Depart<Col N="506" /> ment to carry out these services was a solicitor or barrister.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 453, 454, 455 and 456 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the Sports Campus Ireland project was transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to my Department on 1 January 2001. My attention was not at any time drawn to the fact that queries had arisen regarding the status of one of the companies of the consortium that had been awarded the contract for the aquatic and leisure centre, until the issue was reported in the national press earlier this month.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Government informally decided at its meeting of 7 March that following consultation with the Attorney General I would arrange for the preparation of an independent report on the matter for the next meeting of the Government. It was subsequently agreed on 10 March, by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Attorney General and I, that an essential input into this report would be an inquiry on issues surrounding the award of the operator's contract for the aquatic and leisure centre at Abbotstown, to be carried out under the auspices of the Attorney General, focusing on issues relating to the corporate governance of CSID in so far as it concerned the process of selecting the preferred bidder, and the processes and procedures adopted within CSID leading to and including the selection process. The draft report was brought to Government on 20 March 2002 and I will bring the completed report to Government today for its consideration, following which a statement will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the RAPID programme is a focused initiative by the Government to target the 25 most concentrated areas of urban disadvantage in the country. The programme will ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through targeting State resources, provided in the national development plan. The actual amount that will be available to or invested in each RAPID area will depend on the needs of the area, to be identified in an area implementation plan. It will also depend on the capacity of Departments and statutory agencies to address those needs through finances available under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The programme also seeks to build on the experience gained through a range of other initiatives, including the integrated services process, by facilitating closer co-ordination and better integration in the delivery of local services, thereby ensuring the best possible use of existing resources to bring about real and practical improvements for local communities. I understand the national co-ordinator received the area plan for the Dublin northside area on Friday 22 March last. He will now begin the process of submitting all of the proposals contained therein to the relevant Departments for dissemination either within the individual Departments or to the appropriate agencies under the Departments' remit. As part of the process, Departments and agencies will be asked to establish a timeframe for implementation of each proposal, which will enable the national co-ordinator to track delivery of the overall programme.</P>
      <P>A national monitoring committee, under the chair of Ms Maureen Gaffney, has also been established to oversee the operation of the programme and will report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on progress in its implementation.</P>

This grant was subject to the terms and conditions of the programme, which include the execution of a deed of trust and the examin<Col N="511" /> ation of the drawings and tender documentation by my Department's technical advisers. The deed of trust provides <i>inter alia </i>for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. It is invoked by my Department's legal advisers, the Chief State's Solicitors Office. The CSSO has been requested to prepare a deed of trust in this case and it will be in contact with the firm of solicitors representing the organisation in this regard. Payment of the grant cannot be made until the deed of trust has been executed.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that although the grant was allocated in 2000 and the organisation was informed of requirements at that time, it has only recently submitted the drawings and tender documentation required and these are being referred to my Department's technical advisers for examination and approval and must be approved before payment can be sanctioned.</P>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract document; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>A preliminary report has been submitted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for the replacement of the swimming pool at the Dundrum recreation centre. My Department has requested further information from the council in connection with this proposal. The application for the swimming pool at the Dundrum recreation centre will be considered further on receipt of this information.</P>

      <P>In responding to the question, I <Col N="512" /> draw the Deputy's attention to the results of research conducted by Bord Fáilte among overseas visitors to Ireland last year which showed that: one-third of visitors' experiences surpassed their expectations; more than 60% of visitors felt their expectations were met; and only 4% were disappointed. It is true that an increasing proportion of our visitors from mainland Europe are concerned about value for money, especially the cost of eating out and the price of alcohol. However, more than half of overseas visitors expressed satisfaction with all round value for money in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In terms of service and customer satisfaction, Bord Fáilte's research showed that nine out of ten overseas visitors said that friendliness and hospitality were an important factor in choosing their Irish holiday and 88% declared themselves very satisfied with the friendliness and hospitality encountered during their stay. This is echoed by research carried out by CERT which revealed a generally high level of customer satisfaction with service.</P>
      <P>I have continued to impress on the tourism and hospitality industry the importance of maintaining international competitiveness and keeping prices as low as possible, in particular given the advent of the euro and the increasingly discerning and demanding attitude of international travellers. Customer service is critical in any service industry, and particularly in the tourism and hospitality industry. In recent years, CERT has invested heavily in fostering a culture of customer care within individual businesses and todate, over 4,000 managers and employees have benefited from customer care training under the &ldquo;Ireland's Best&rdquo; programme.</P>

      <P>The young people's services and facilities fund was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. The main focus of the YPFSF has been on the local drugs task force areas where integrated plans were prepared on the basis of detailed guidelines <Col N="513" /> agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the information sought by the Deputy in relation to funding allocated to local drugs task force areas, these areas are based on the partnership areas that had been previously identified for local development purposes. It should be noted that the local drugs task force areas and partnership areas are not co-terminus in all cases. The following tables give a break<Col N="514" /> down by project of all the funding allocated to date in the task force areas under the YPFSF.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should note that the interim funding allocated in 2002 is in respect of funding required by services projects to sustain them to the end of 2002. By that time, the evaluation of the overall fund will be complete and decisions can be made on which projects are to be mainstreamed in 2003. Details of the population of each local drugs task force area is not available.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's national school, Calry, County Sligo is being extended-refurbished as part of the Government's programme as is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>The delay in answering the representation made on 31 May 2001 in relation to the provision of sports facilities at St. Wolstan's Community School is regretted and this matter is now in hand. The current position is that my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, has provisionally allocated funding towards the cost of a synthetic all weather hockey pitch at the school under his Department's sports capital programme. In addition, my Department's <Col N="523" /> post-primary building unit has agreed in principle that the funding normally provided for a standard football pitch will be allocated to partly fund this development. Detailed costs and proposals as to how the anticipated shortfall in funding will be financed are awaited from the school authorities in order that this application can be considered further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and Rule 64 (1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she or he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available. Pupils and parents enjoy a number of legal rights regarding their choice of school for primary education. These derive from the Constitution, legislation and my Department's rules.</P>
      <P>In Article 42 of the Constitution, the State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children. Article 42 goes on to state that parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in private schools recognised or established by the State. It prohibits the State from obliging parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State. It must require, in view of actual conditions, that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statutory rights to choice of school derive from the Education Act, 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources. In addition, section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the 1998 Act provides that a board of management of a primary school shall publish, in such manner as the board with the agreement of the patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school and ensure that as regards that policy principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are <Col N="524" /> respected and such directions as may be made from time to time by the Minister, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school and the constitutional rights of all persons concerned, are complied with.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.</P>
    <P>Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student themselves, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management are considered necessary in order to remedy the matter complained of.</P>
    <P>In addition, in cases where parents experience difficulties in having their child admitted to the school system, my Department gives assistance in securing a suitable school placement through the involvement of its inspectorate in a consultative process with the school authorities.</P>

A number of options were discussed in relation to a suitable placement for the child and it was agreed by the child's parents that they would reflect on these options.

I understand the child's parents have expressed satisfaction at the progress the child is making in response to the home tuition service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 474, 492, 527, 531, 536, 546 and 569 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector, in order to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on the 4 March 2002. Arising from these discussions a contingency plan was prepared and agreed between my Department and the managerial authorities. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. In addition, my Department undertook to recoup the cost to the management authorities in advertising for, recruiting and training appropriate personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis.</P>
      <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, based on a minimum of two hours supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required, this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28 per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For purposes of the contingency arrangements, payments have been made to schools by my <Col N="528" /> Department, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270 per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum. In addition, funding has also been provided to cover employers PRSI, holiday pay and administrative costs. In aggregate, the sum disbursed to schools amounts to some &euro;9 million, which equates to nine weeks calculated in accordance with the above formula. The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant.</P>
    <P>The joint managerial body placed advertisements on behalf of the managerial authorities in the national media over the weekend of the 16-17 February. In addition, the JMB organised training on a regional basis and operated a telephone help-line for schools. My Department has recouped &euro;114,258 to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date.</P>
    <P>The contingency plan, by its nature, is flexible and does not specify a pupil-supervisor ratio, as it is recognised that the number of persons required would vary from school to school depending on the layout, both internal and external. Accordingly, information concerning the number of people recruited and the number of schools in which they are working is not readily available.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the contingency plan, it is necessary for schools as part of the recruitment and appointment process to secure and check character references and to make such inquiries, as the school considers necessary, to satisfy itself as to the character of each appointee. In addition, schools are obliged to obtain from the Garda a satisfactory clearance report in respect of each appointee. </P>

The teacher was paid at the rate appropriate for recognised teachers on the basis of details supplied in the documentation, which was submitted to my Department, nominating this teacher for payment of incremental salary grant. It was subsequently discovered, in an examination of the teacher's file, that the details supplied were incorrect and that the teacher was not recognised as a secondary teacher.

      <P>In June 1999 the stay in school retention initiative at second level was launched and a total of 118 schools now participate in the initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. A commitment was given to participating schools that they would receive funding up to 31 August 2002. Significant funding has been made available by the Government under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to address the problem of early school leaving covering both first and second levels. I have provided a total of &euro;22.5 million for school completion initiatives in 2002. This will be sufficient to facilitate a significant expansion of the initiatives in this area. Any expansion proposed will focus on areas with the greatest pupil retention difficulties. In this regard, proposals are currently under consideration in my Department and the circumstances of the schools referred to by the Deputy are also being considered in this context. I expect to be in a position <Col N="537" /> to make a further announcement in relation to this matter shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 501 and 513 together.</P>
      <P>An application for funding under fund for the development of targeted responses to children at risk was received from the Ballybeg Community Education Project in 2001. This fund is overseen by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Hanafin. The purpose of this fund is to develop preventative and supportive programmes that are targeted at children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>In assessing applications, consideration was given to Department supported interventions already in place in the areas concerned so as to avoid duplication of effort and resources. In this regard, my Department is providing support for an eight to 15 early school leaver project, ESLI, in the Ballybeg area. It was considered that there was a substantial overlap between the aims, objectives, the target group identified and the services provided under both the ESLI project and the Ballybeg Community Education Project. It was therefore decided it would be preferable to fund these projects on a joint basis. Accordingly, both projects have been requested to come together to develop a joint proposal for consideration by my Department. I have arranged for a co-ordinator to work with both groups to assist them in developing a single holistic plan that addresses the educational needs of the children at risk in the Ballybeg area. A proposal has not been received to date.</P>

Where the authorities of a voluntary secondary school decide to suspend a teacher, they generally do so on the basis of suspension with pay.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access <Col N="540" /> to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education &ndash; that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post leaving certificate courses: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she or he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant are being reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of <Col N="541" /> the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>A building project at St. Mary's national school, Briarhill, Castelgar, Galway is currently in architectural planning as part of the Government's programme. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the Government's expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>A suitable site for the new school at Eureka secondary school, Kells, County Meath has been identified. Officials in the building unit of my Department will shortly commence negotiations with the vendor with a view to acquiring <Col N="548" /> this site. Assuming agreement can be reached as to the price of the site, it will be necessary to obtain outline planning permission before formally concluding a deal. In the circumstances, it is not possible to provide a time-frame for the completion of this project. The Deputy can be assured that my officials will work assiduously to progress this project. I am unaware of any difficulties being experienced by people seeking information on this project as the school management authority has been regularly updated on its progress.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school referred to by the Deputy on the 30 September 2001 was 49 pupils, which will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and one mainstream class teacher for the 2002-03 school year. A valid enrolment of 50 pupils on 30 September 2001 was required for the appointment of the second mainstream class teacher for the 2002-03 school year. I have arranged for an inspector of my Department to visit the school to assess the situation and report directly to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a teacher to a primary school is a matter for the board of management of the school. The Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers and alleviate the current supply difficulties. As part of a range of initiatives to improve teacher supply, the intake to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education has been increased dramatically in recent years. Since 1999, more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B.Ed. programme. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total intake to the colleges of education in the 2001-02 academic year was increased to a record 1,461. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,750 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. The number of places made available on the graduate diploma courses since <Col N="553" /> 1997 is 1,453. Between 2001 and 2002 it is projected that some 2,300 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995, when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>In addition to increasing the output of graduates, the Government has introduced other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified. Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and since September 2000 teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
    <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes. The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>Escorts are provided on school transport services conveying pupils with special needs to school. There are no plans for the provision of escorts on all school buses at present. The safety aspects of school transport, including the three for two seating ratio and the provision of seat belts has been examined by the school transport section of my Department together with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A report has been completed and copies are available from my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Submissions are invited from all interested parties. When the submissions are received and examined, consideration will be given to the question of what improvements can <Col N="556" /> be put in place to further improve the safety of the children who use the service.</P>

      <P>My Department's current public private partnership, PPP, pilot programme, which has been under way for some time, consists of a bundle of five post-primary schools, a new school of music and a new national maritime college. Under the public private partnership model of procurement, consortia bid for projects on a design, build, finance and operate/maintain basis. As indicated in my reply to the Deputy on Wednesday, 20 March, the school referred to is being refurbished and extended as part of the Government's capital programme. As the design and architectural process for the project has already commenced, it is not possible to include it with any further projects being considered under my Department's PPP pilot programme.</P>

      <P>At present, the National Educational <Col N="557" /> Psychological Service Agency, NEPS, provides a psychological service to post-primary schools in County Westmeath. However, the agency does not yet have a sufficient complement of psychologists to be able to offer a full educational psychological service to all primary schools. According to the terms of the Government decision to establish NEPS, the agency is expanding its service in a phased and orderly manner as additional psychologists are recruited. The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission is currently organising a recruitment competition for additional psychologists in NEPS. This competition is now nearing completion, and it is expected that a number of appointments will be made to the midlands region.</P>
      <P>I am aware that many children in schools require support from educational psychologists. I have, therefore, announced recently that the expansion of NEPS will be accelerated so that all schools will have access to its service much earlier than originally planned. Meanwhile, primary schools in County Westmeath that do not yet have access to the psychological service provided by NEPS may avail of my Department's scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, full details of which are available from NEPS or from my Department's website.</P>

      <P>The allocation for post-primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;182.31 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in post-primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. In view of the greatly increased level of investment in the post primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>St. Columba's comprehensive school is to receive additional accommodation as part of the Government's programme and is currently at stage four-five  &ndash; detail design and bill of quantities &ndash; in architectural planning.

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of &euro;58,407,951, £46 million, per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes, CE, come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school sector. My Department will receive a total of &euro;40,631,618, £32 million, in this school year. The grant has increased to &euro;102, £80 per pupil with effect from January of this year. In line with the new arrangements, &euro;14,484 was lodged to the school's bank account recently towards the cost of ancillary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is aware of the major new disadvantage programme, Giving Children An Even Break, which I launched in January 2001, to deal <Col N="559" /> with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme, including the school in question, retain their entitlements under that scheme, and also receive extra funding. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school in question is benefiting from the services of a disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home/school/community liaison teacher. The school also qualifies for special supplementary capitation funding at the rate of &euro;38.09 per pupil and a refund of the television licence fee.</P>
    <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to Giving Children An Even Break. The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and is eligible to receive &euro;2,149 in respect of the current school year, towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned. This funding is in addition to the &euro;5,294 for the current school year that the school received under the disadvantaged areas scheme. Schools categorised as urban in Giving Children An Even Break with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils, including the school in question, are being supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes. Any claim for additional allowances for teachers who are teaching in disadvantaged schools must be submitted to the Teachers Conciliation Council.</P>

      <P>Newtown national school, Crettyard, County Laois is being refurbished as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

      <P>I understand the pupils in question, who are attending a special school in Cork, are currently approaching their 16th birthday. These pupils are entitled to continue to avail of their special school placement until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th birthday. I fully recognise the importance of ensuring that appropriate support services continue to be available for persons with special needs beyond their 18th year. My proposals to address this important issue are contained in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2002.</P>

      <P>Primary and post-primary schools catering for non-national pupils who have significant English language deficits are entitled to assistance to enable these pupils to gain full access to the curriculum. Schools that have 14 to 27 non-English speaking non-national pupils enrolled are entitled to a full-time temporary language support teacher. Schools with 28 or more such pupils <Col N="564" /> are entitled to two full-time temporary language support teachers.</P>
      <P>So far this year, almost 150 language support teacher posts have been sanctioned for primary schools and almost 100 wholetime teacher equivalents for post-primary schools. It should be noted too, that all non-national pupils on a school's roll are included in estimating normal staffing entitlements and for all grant purposes.</P>
      <P>For schools with fewer than 14 non-English speaking non-national pupils a system of grant assistance in the case of primary schools, or the allocation of additional teaching hours in the case of post-primary schools, operates. A grant of &euro;6,348.69, £5,000, is paid to primary schools with three to eight pupils with English language deficits, while a primary school with nine to 13 such pupils receives a grant of &euro;9,523.04, £7,500. To date this year, in excess of &euro;1.3 million in grant assistance has been paid to primary schools in respect of non-English speaking pupils.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides a special start-up grant of &euro;635 to each school in which an English language support teacher is sanctioned. There is a follow-up grant of &euro;318 for each successive year for which the English language support teacher continues to be sanctioned. In addition, Integrate Ireland Language and Training, IILT, formerly known as the Refugee Language Support Unit, a company of Trinity College, is funded by my Department to provide training for English language support teachers and their principals. An English language programme and English language training materials are available to all teachers who attend its in-service courses. A portfolio &ndash; European Language Portfolio &ndash; has been developed by IILT to provide a focus for pupils' learning, which concentrates on English language in the context of the school curriculum and also on socialisation within the school. One of the fundamental aims of the training is to equip teachers to enable non-English speaking pupils to participate fully in school life. An information booklet, detailing the supports available from my Department to schools providing for non-national pupils, has been issued to all primary and post-primary schools in the country.</P>
