      <P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 29<i>a,</i> 29<i>b</i> and 56 without debate agreed?</P>

      <P>Under normal procedures, No. 29<i>a</i> would be referred to a committee of the House. We had understood that it was to be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights but, according to the terms of the motion before us, I presume it will be passed without debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we should not allow a motion as serious as that relating to the planning and development regulations to be passed without debate. The legislation which gave rise to the regulations has been the subject of controversy and people are now obliged to pay to make comments on or objections to planning applications. In future, people will ask why legislation of this sort, which removes people's ability to participate in the democratic process, came about. I object to the fact that there will be no debate on this matter.</P>

      <P>This Bill is being rushed through the House. We only received it late on the evening before last. As I do not know whether the House will sit next week, it is perhaps facetious of me to suggest we take Report Stage then. It is dangerous to pass legislation in this way. While I am agreeable to taking the Bill today, I wish to put down the marker that if there are flaws in the Bill, the House is not being given the opportunity to examine them.</P>

        <b>: </b>A Cheann Comhairle, you will recall that I pressed time and again for the publication of this Bill and promised to co-operate fully on it. This does not extend, however, to agreeing to take all Stages in three hours. Even the schedule initially agreed last week, under which the Bill was to be taken all day, was very restrictive given that this is major, technical legislation. We have repeatedly seen the dangers of rushing technical legislation through the House. I am not agreeable to the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Jim Higgins. It would be very irresponsible to agree to take all Stages today. The Bill has immense <Col N="552" /> implications for the organisation, structure, management, control and balance of communications. It is totally unacceptable to take all Stages today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Education and Science confirm whether the two teenagers who are facing charges arising from the deaths of Garda Tony Tighe and Garda Michael Padden had, when previously convicted for car stealing offences, been refused admission to Oberstown House and Trinity House, both of which are within the charge of the Minister for Education ad Science? Will he explain how after five years in government neither he nor his predecessor, Deputy Martin, provided sufficient places for young offenders in either Oberstown House or Trinity House, or any other location?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday in the House and earlier following the tragic events of the weekend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attempted to make great play of the provision of extra places of detention for young offenders. Many people will not be aware that the Minister for Education and Science is the person responsible for young offenders, unlike the Ministers of State at the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children who have responsibility for those who have not come before the courts and require places. Those places are being provided.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, the Minister for Education and Science, with his encyclopaedic knowledge, will tell us why there is such management chaos in the Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre; why there has been disarray among management in that centre; why its full capacity of 39 places is confined to an operational capacity of only 27; and what is and has been going on under his stewardship of the centre for the last two years. Can he indicate to the House whether he is aware of the grave concern that has been expressed by many people in the area on the failure of management to deal with the problems of young offenders in this institution, and the effective sterilisation of a significant number of places which if they had been open and available under proper management would not have resulted in these two young offenders, to whom Deputy Noonan refers, being turned away?</P>

      <P>It is pretty sad at the end of five years in Government for a Minister for Education and Science to come to the House and give such a reply, and have it drafted in a manner which is downright misleading. The issue is places for remand prisoners &ndash; teenagers on remand. The Minister instead gave the statistics for the total number of places available. Will the Minister confirm that the number of remand places is 31? Young people on remand are being turned away from both Oberstown House and Trinity House and this applies to the young people involved in the tragic death of two gardaí. The Minister said that a place would be available for the 15-year old tomorrow. Is that place being provided by the release of another young person? The Minister also said that there was an assessment at the Finglas centre to refer the second teenager to a hostel. Was he referred to that hostel? What procedures were in place in the hostel and how come he was out driving a stolen car late at night if he was supposed to be in the care of the hostel?</P>

      <P>I appreciate and sympathise with you, a Cheann Comhairle. You have no responsibility for replies from that side of the House and you were carrying out your job. However, you must understand that we were frustrated that legitimate questions asked during leaders' questions were refused a reply by this Minister. Let me start again and I hope he has got his notes together. The Minister of State sitting behind him can give him the prompts when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the tragedy of the killing of two gardaí on duty over the weekend by young offenders who should have been under the care of the Minister for Education and Science in one <Col N="560" /> of the institutions for which he has responsibility. He has failed abysmally to answer the questions put legitimately to him by Deputy Noonan. I want to bring him back to the question he did not even address when I asked about the same subject. The Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre has a capacity of 39 places. At present 27 beds are available for use. Have you ever been to this place, Minister? Are you aware of the chaos there? Are you aware that the inmates have taken over the running of this institution? Are you aware that on one occasion such was the disorder that some of the inmates got on to the roof and the Garda helicopter had to come to restore order? Are you aware that due to the incompetence of the management there, overseen by the incompetence of your Department, that the operational cost to the taxpayer for every child in that institution works out at £250,000 per year in old money? I can give you the questions in serial number. One, are you the Minister with responsibility for this institution? Two, have you ever been to it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. Is the Minister for Education and Science the Minister responsible? He does not seem to know whether he is. Has he ever been to the institution in question? Is he aware of the management crisis there? It is not just about some of the young offenders causing damage internally. There is a separate but related management crisis that is exclusively within the domain of the failure of the Department in Marlborough Street to exercise authority over the executive management in that institution. What steps does he propose to take in the dying days of this Administration to ensure that young lethal offenders who took away the lives of two gardaí over the weekend will not be turned away from a place where they could be safely kept in custody and dealt with? Would the Minister like me to put that in writing or can he remember it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>Can the Minister confirm that in this matter he is not substituting for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that the items raised are totally within the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science and his Minister of State? Will the Minister put on record all contact which his Department has had with the two teenagers who were in the car that was driven at high speed and which led to the deaths of two gardaí? In the interchange between his Department and these young offenders, could he state in particular whether or not the recommendation of the Finglas centre to send one of them to a hostel was carried out? Will the Minister explain why, after five years in Government, there are only 31 detention places available for under-16 year olds on remand? Why has there been such a failure in his Department to address this when the issue of young offenders stealing cars and driving them at high speed is well known, not only in this and other cities, but also in the Minister's own constituency?</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Street Crime: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Shatter on Wednesday, 17 April 2002:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">conscious of the fear prevailing in the country following the most recent increase in violent deaths, and aware of the need to restore a sense of security on our streets,</P>
    <P Just="Center">noting that six people died violently in the past week alone, including two members of the Garda Síochána in the course of their duty,</P>
    <P Just="Center">noting that there has been an increase of 131% in assaults causing harm in the year 2000, and</P>
    <P Just="Center">aware that the Government's refusal to accept the reality of the astounding increase in street violence has allowed a situation to develop whereby only one in four assaults are reported to the gardaí, </P>
    <P Just="Center">condemns this Government for allowing zero tolerance to become zero action in relation to street violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" />Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>welcomes the substantial decrease in serious crime since the Government took office and the &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; measures taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in achieving this remarkable result;</P>
    <P>commends the enormous level of resources allocated to the Garda Síochána, including the increase of &euro;319.7 million, IR£252 million &ndash; 53% &ndash; in the Garda Síochána Vote, from &euro;599.3 million, IR£472 million, in 1997 to &euro;919 million, IR£723.7 million, in the current year;</P>
    <P>notes that the strength of the Garda Síochána now exceeds 11,700 &ndash; an all-time historic high &ndash; which constitutes an increase of approximately 900 members since the Government took office, and is on target to reach the planned strength of 12,000 this year;</P>
    <P>recognises the provision of significant additional resources for other sectors of the criminal justice system, including increasing the number of prison places by 1,207 to date, with approximately 700 additional closed places on the way;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" />commends the success of the Government in ending the scandal of the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; in our prisons system;</P>
    <P>commends the Minister's legislative record since taking office in enacting an unprecedented 46 Bills and, particularly, his reform of the criminal law;</P>
    <P>acknowledges the significant structural reforms being made to the criminal justice system through, for example, the appointment of additional judges, the establishment of the Courts Service and the Prisons Service and the significant progress being made in reforming the administration of the Garda Síochána;</P>
    <P>commends the allocation of additional resources aimed at the expansion of the probation and welfare service;</P>
    <P>endorses the measures adopted on the basis of the additional funding in the sum of &euro;110.5 million, IR£87 million, allocated under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for crime prevention directed towards young offenders;</P>
    <P>notes the social crime prevention activities supported by the Government as an important intervention in the lives of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young persons, not least the significant numerical expansion in Garda youth diversion projects, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present;</P>
    <P>welcomes the measures taken at community level to deal with local crime problems, including the massive expansion of the Garda CCTV programme, for which &euro;15 million has been allocated over the period 2001-03;</P>
    <P>commends the Garda Síochána's national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, for its many successes in tackling public order issues since October 2000 and, in particular, its focus on &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; of criminal activity and high visibility patrolling;</P>
    <P>welcomes the commencement of the Garda Síochána's Operation Encounter on 23 February 2002, which builds upon Operation Oíche by using acquired information about the times and locations of previous public order incidents to address the problem at source, such as in the vicinity of night clubs, licensed premises and fast food outlets;</P>
    <P>endorses the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a further proactive response to tackling the problem of late night violence and disruption, in so far as it has its origins outside licensed premises or fast food outlets;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" />notes that, according to the national household crime victimisation survey conducted by the Central Statistics Office in 1998, almost two thirds of assaults were reported to the Garda Síochána and that the principal reason cited for not reporting was that the incident was &ldquo;not serious enough-no loss&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>welcomes the measures taken by the Garda Síochána to facilitate the reporting of crime, particularly among members of ethnic minorities, through its quality customer service initiative and the establishment of a Garda racial and intercultural office;</P>
    <P>acknowledges the improvements in recent years in the service to victims of crime, including the publication of a victims charter and the provision of additional funding for service providers;</P>
    <P>notes the important steps taken in relation to dealing effectively with crime and crime related issues, including the fear of crime, through the establishment of the State's first ever national crime council;</P>
    <P>welcomes the high level of support among the community for the Garda Síochána; and</P>
    <P>approves the Government's continuing commitment to prioritise structural and legislative measures to build upon the significant advances made in the fight against crime and, in particular, to tackle effectively the problem of street violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes an event happens that is so outrageous it exposes the fact that the Emperor has no clothes. The killing of two gardaí, a young man murdered and several hospitalised in the one weekend demonstrates the extent of lawlessness on our streets. The tragic killing of two courageous gardaí lifts it above what would otherwise have been no more than a typical weekend in urban Ireland, yet all we got from the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night was a hypocritical rant more suited to the back of an election lorry in Cahirciveen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality in so many housing estates is worse, not only because there are regular, unlawful killings but because the violence and intimidation is relentless and persistent. The breakdown of public order has become a major issue for Dáil Éireann and the media only because it has spread into middle class areas. The disgraceful conduct of visiting nomadic traders at the River Dodder became a major issue for the same reason. <Col N="574" /> Nobody photographed the unfortunate residents of Rossfield in west Tallaght when they were besieged in their homes in the same circumstances for months.</P>
    <P>The truth is that working class estates throughout west Dublin &ndash; the area I know best &ndash; are tortured by anti-social activity, thuggish intimidation and so-called joy-riding. A half dozen youths out of control in an estate can wreak havoc. I recently attended yet another meeting in my constituency with a Garda inspector who insisted that the situation was being exaggerated by local community representatives, myself and other public representatives. As we emerged from the meeting a car parked next to the Garda car had been set alight and burnt out. That is not untypical. The figures are available for the number of burnt out cars collected by the local authority in my constituency and across west Dublin.</P>
    <P>Along with other public representatives, I regularly attend meetings in my constituency to discuss crime, including break-ins, cars stolen or vandalised or being driven around estates at all hours of the night. On 26 February I wrote a letter to the local Garda superintendent. It states:</P>
    <P>At a specially convened public meeting [I named the place] on 21 February, public representatives listened to a litany of despairing complaints from law abiding citizens who are being subject to, in the words of one man, &ldquo;a reign of terror by young thugs&rdquo;. The extent of car thefts, joy-riding, vandalism, break-ins and intimidation is outrageous. An estimated ten cars are damaged in this estate for every one stolen. Between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. the people are subjected to regular so-called joy-riding. One woman reported that her car had been vandalised seven times since November. One home owner instanced his own experience where three young gangsters threatened him with an iron bar if he did not go back into his home while they were preparing to steal his car. He rang the gardaí on Friday, 8 February to alert them and was told someone would call to him by 10 p.m. He has not heard from the gardaí since.</P>
    <P>That is not untypical. The gardaí seem unable to cope. It is understandable in a situation where, for an area with a population of 80,000 people there are 159 gardaí who are organised on three shifts working on five over seven days. One does not need to be a mathematical genius to work out how many gardaí are on duty at any one time.</P>
    <P>One Garda station in the whole of Tallaght serves 80,000 people. Until 1997, when the then Minister for Justice and the then Commissioner accorded divisional status to Tallaght, it was a subdivision of Crumlin Garda station. Divisional status was supposed to bring more manpower, vehicles and resources to the policing of the greater Tallaght region. Five years later that decision has not been implemented. Recently in this House the explanation of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who indisput<Col N="575" /> ably does not understand urban Ireland, was that the accommodation was not available in the one Garda station to implement divisional status. All that has been done has been the appointment of a chief superintendent, who must be resident outside the district because there is no office for him in Tallaght. That situation is unconscionable.</P>
    <P>It is intolerable that law abiding citizens who are paying their taxes far more compliantly than some of the better off in our society cannot get a garda when they want one, their telephone call answered or protection in their homes. A man of six feet and three inches in height, mentioned in the letter to which I have referred, attended the meeting to which I also referred to outline what happened when he found three young fellows trying to break into his car. They threatened him with an iron bar if he did not return inside his home and when he telephoned the gardaí they did not appear. That situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>There is no visible presence of gardaí in whole tracts of west Dublin and there are no community gardaí on the beat. When there is an emergency, be it foot and mouth disease or whatever, those involved in community policing appear to be the first to be removed from the beat. Occasional Garda cars skirt through the estate, which are no deterrent to the young fellows who are creating mayhem.</P>
    <P>There is no appreciation of this among the conscientious officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Like Members of this House and members of the media, those officials do not live in these estates and genuinely do not appreciate what is being endured. I know a man, whose name I will supply to the Minister, who owns a corner shop. It looks like a bunker in Beirut during the siege. The shop also contains a post office and is broken into about twice a week. It is well known in the area. The man is besieged by about a dozen intimidating youths who hang around outside the shop all the time. There is no policing.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to expect law abiding citizens to put up with that. Look at the current situation. The bus service to west Tallaght is again under threat because the bus workers are being subjected to youths throwing stones and missiles at them. When they board the buses, the youths wreck the bus, push out the windows and so forth. The bus drivers, not surprisingly, are instructed by their unions not to supply service to certain areas because they are at risk. Serious injury has been inflicted on some bus drivers. The youths concerned are a tiny minority of the population. The law abiding citizens in those estates still have to get up in the morning, travel to work and travel home in the evenings but they are deprived of a transport service. They have to walk miles to get access to public transport.</P>
    <P>What is our duty? Is it to the young thugs who are running wild in these estates or is it to the law abiding, tax paying citizens who cannot get to or <Col N="576" /> from their place of work because of this problem? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not understand. This does not happen in Cahirciveen. I am glad of that but I am damned if I can understand why it should be allowed to happen in parts of my constituency. Since the Minister has not encountered this in his life experience, he does not intend to do anything about it. The situation is intolerable and it is unfortunate that it takes the death of two courageous gardaí to bring it to the floor of the House in this fashion.</P>
    <P>The two gardaí were killed by two young gangsters in appalling circumstances. It could have been any other citizens who were killed. It is a miracle there are not many more such incidents. The situation is no longer restricted to local authority estates and working class areas. I was in Templeogue last week at the request of a number of householders whose cars and houses are regularly subjected to casual wanton vandalism by youths on their way to the adjacent park where they congregate for the purpose of anti-social activity. Law and order has broken down. What is the Minister's response?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in offering my condolences to the families of the two gardaí who were so tragically killed. It was a huge shock to everybody and an enormous waste of human life for two men, who were simply doing their duty to all of us, to be killed so tragically.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for the national drugs strategy and local development, I can state with some confidence that through initiatives such as the national drugs strategy, the RAPID programme and the young people's facilities and services fund, the Government is addressing the primary causes of crime, namely, poverty, social deprivation and drug misuse. We have long recognised that there are no quick fix solutions to such deep-seated problems. In our policies in this area we need to look beyond short-term goals, target those areas of greatest need and engage with local communities in a meaningful way. For this reason, the policies which we have initiated in the area of drugs and social exclusion are long-term strategies which target resources at the most deprived areas and place local communities at the heart of the decision-making process in relation to their areas.</P>

      <P>I apologise for not mentioning that earlier. Last year, we launched a new national drugs strategy for 2001-08, following the largest consultation process ever undertaken on the drug problem. The strategy brings together for the first time all elements of drugs policy in <Col N="577" /> Ireland into a single framework. Responsibilities are clearly assigned across Departments and agencies. They will implement a series of 100 individual actions across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
      <P>Under the supply reduction pillar, there is a number of actions which will directly impact on street crime. Garda resources in local drugs task force areas will be increased substantially. Through the strategy, we aim to increase drug seizures by 25% by 2004 and 50% by 2008. The assets of middle ranking criminals will be targeted by the Criminal Assets Bureau. Operations similar to Dóchas, Nightcap and Cleanstreet, which have proven very successful, will be implemented in urban centres throughout the country where drug dealing is taking place. Cutting off the supply is essential but it is only one part of the strategy.</P>
      <P>The prevention pillar will see a major awareness campaign being launched later this year, with substance misuse prevention programmes being taught in all secondary schools. Under the treatment pillar, immediate access to professional assessment and counselling will be put in place, while commencement of treatment not later than one month after assessment will be available. In this context, a range of rehabilitation and treatment programmes will be put in place in each health board area, designed to reintegrate the misuser back into society, as well as a series of training and employment programmes. In some treatment centres at present, over 40% of the people in treatment are back to work. The strategy also identifies the critical need to target teenage misusers and, accordingly, a special protocol is being developed to allow under 18 year olds to be treated for serious drug problems. This is a radical step forward and will help us more easily to make the interventions needed at this critical time.</P>
      <P>A key element in the new strategy is the establishment of regional drugs task forces which will bring together all the key agencies and the local community on an area basis to develop and implement drug action plans in every region in Ireland. These task forces build on the experience of the local drugs task forces which have proven very effective in the areas worst affected by drugs misuse. Crucially, they will ensure that the regional response will be relevant and co-ordinated to maximise the impact of the resources committed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognising the importance of the task forces to the national drugs strategy, I have secured an unprecedented level of resources to ensure that action plans developed locally to tackle the drug problem are implemented effectively on the ground. As a direct result of this investment, over 300 drug related projects are now up and running in these areas. Funding of &euro;1.8 million for 33 projects in the local drugs task force areas has recently been secured, which brings the total funding approved for the second round of task force plans to &euro;13.5 million. This is on top of a <Col N="578" /> commitment of almost &euro;13 million over three years to develop premises for drug projects in task force areas and a further &euro;11 million annually towards the cost of mainstreaming over 120 projects under the first round of task force plans. I was delighted to open the STAR project in Ballyfermot a few days ago, another example of such projects.</P>
    <P>With a funding injection of this kind into the most needy areas, there can be no question about the Government's commitment to making this strategy work. We are only beginning to see the positive impact of the strategy. A clear indicator of its success will ultimately be a significant fall in drug related crime. Already, we are hearing anecdotal evidence that this is happening and I am confident that this trend will be borne out over time. However, we are aware of the examples cited by Deputy Rabbitte. There are problems in certain working class estates which cause great fear among the local communities. It would be foolish to ignore that but I believe we are making inroads. There is no quick fix solution. Obviously the issue will have to be tackled in the short-term but there must also be a long-term strategy.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the enormous contribution of the Garda Síochána in the development and implementation of the national drugs strategy. From the start, the gardaí have committed themselves to the work of the task forces and, at national level, they continue to make an invaluable contribution to policy development.</P>
    <P>In relation to treatment measures, I wish to highlight the significant strides that have been made over the lifetime of the Government. When we got into Government there were 1,400 people in treatment, there are now nearly 6,000. We have also opened up the whole idea of alternative treatments to methadone. We are looking at residential treatment such as the Keltoi Drug Free Centre which we opened recently and we will be opening Coolamber in County Longford shortly.</P>
    <P>In the context of this debate, I want to pay particular attention to the measures that have been introduced to target young people at risk of drug misuse. The risk factors associated with drug misuse are often those associated with crime and for this reason, the type of initiatives which we are pursuing in the drug prevention area will also impact in terms of diverting young people away from crime.</P>
    <P>Under the young people's facilities and services fund the Government has committed &euro;130 million over the lifetime of the national development plan. We have already spent over &euro;60 million to develop 340 different projects around the city of Dublin and other parts of the country. The target group for this fund are young people aged between ten and 21 years of age. The fund is supporting the development of 50 youth facilities, 20 sports clubs and nearly 20 community centres in areas that have traditionally suffered from a lack of decent youth facilities. We also need to reach <Col N="579" /> out and engage with young people most at risk and with this in mind, over 90 youth and outreach workers have been appointed to work with young people in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of this Government grants totalling &euro;211 million have been allocated to 2,894 clubs and community groups throughout the country under the sports capital programme. When one compares this to the &euro;25 million allocated by the rainbow Government to local sports projects during their period in office, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, has done an enormous amount of work in developing sport throughout the country and deserves our thanks and congratulations.</P>
    <P>We have also set up the National Advisory Committee on Drugs which is looking into the problem of drugs so as to keep the Government and everyone up to date on what is happening.</P>
    <P>We have also launched the RAPID programme, where we have identified the 25 most deprived areas in the country. Some 165,000 people are living within those areas where we will fast track the national development plan across all statutory services, including education, housing, health, public transport and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>These initiatives are clear evidence of the type of long-term commitment this Government has shown in addressing some of the root causes of crime, poverty, urban deprivation and drug misuse. For the first time ever we are beginning to make vital inroads in the areas of greatest neglect. I am confident that these initiatives will make a real difference to the lives of ordinary people in these areas and contribute in no small way to reducing crime levels and street violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Government's amendment to the motion. Crime has always been a problem. It did not arise today or yesterday. To be fair to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, back in 1997 he outlined his promises regarding what he would do to try and curb crime and those promises have been fulfilled. The situation did not get bad overnight and it will not be put right overnight. The Minister outlined that he was committed to providing extra gardaí and extra prison places and with the number of gardaí at nearly 12,000 and the 1,200 extra prison places, enormous progress has been made in the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yes, there are problems to be solved. If one looks back at the efforts of this and other Governments over the past 25 years, the emphasis has always changed. For many years the emphasis was on paramilitary crime and paramilitary activities. That problem had to be tackled and solved. It took a great deal of the time and energy of the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Then the emphasis moved to organised crime and in the past couple of years we have realised that public order offences and street violence must be tackled. My <Col N="580" /> party has the will to tackle that problem in the future.</P>
    <P>I can identify strongly with much of what Deputy Rabbitte said. No doubt having a general election is marvellous in many ways. That speech was based on reality. General elections get us all, whether one is talking about Ministers in their ivory towers or Opposition members in RTE studios, out and in tune with reality, which is not very nice in many cases.</P>
    <P>I identify totally with and support everything Deputy Rabbitte said and I accept that is the reality, but where was that understanding of the reality when his own party worked on the proposals on its little pledge card? This little pledge card is full of politically correct woolly stuff. Deputy Rabbitte may say that what he spoke about was not in the life experiences of the Minister in Cahirciveen. I think it is not in the life experiences of his own party leader in Sandymount either. I totally agree with what he says. We all should be saying that much more often in here and setting out the reality for the Minister, whoever it is at the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a great deal. There are many extra gardaí but they are not being put in the right places. I totally concur with the point about the vast suburbs around the city. They have been neglected for many years. When they were created, people were unemployed and we put them out there. We are now suffering from the years of neglect of those people. What the hell did we expect when we put people out into green fields 20 or 25 years ago? It was different Governments that did it and I am sure resources were scarce at the time, but the problem may well get worse in some respects before it gets better. Even when the Minister produces all these extra gardaí, it baffles me that every time the Commissioner sits down with his chief superintendents to allocate where they will go, it seems that, although there are handy areas in every society, every chief superintendent gets his share based on historical numbers. The extra numbers are not being put where they are required. There are parts of two divisions in my constituency and in the past five years one division got about 35 extra gardaí and the other got about 70 or 80, but they could do with three, four or five times that number because they are needed.</P>
    <P>In addition the extra gardaí provided are all from the lower ranks. They are no sooner in place but they are promoted to the higher task forces because that is where the establishment is and where there are opportunities for promotion. It is reasonable for every garda to move on but we need to readjust and realise where the problem is, and this is now happening. Over the past couple of years, as the Minister of State, Deputy Ryan, has outlined, enormous sums of money are being spent on fantastic projects.</P>
    <P>However, it will be a slow process because we are dealing with people, many of whom have been &ldquo;no hopers&rdquo; from the night they were conceived. They are from one parent families and <Col N="581" /> dysfunctional families. One often hears people talking about identifying problem kids when they are six or seven. One can identify them from the night they are conceived. What the hell do we expect if we put people in such situations? We must tackle the problem. We must go back to base and look at the way society has developed and the way families are structured. We must look at what support we are giving at an early stage. Some will obviously slip through the net but we can do a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>The problem is also linked to the availability of money. The economy is going well and everybody has more money. Many people know how to handle it, deal with it and enjoy it, but there is a certain sector who cannot cope with that. They do not have the experience of dealing with it and therefore they just blow too much of it on drink. The carry on related to drinking inside pubs, outside the back wall of community centres and elsewhere shows that people just do not seem to have family discipline or discipline at any level. It is easy to criticise anybody who ever&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have broken down much of the discipline that was there previously which was exercised by parents, the Church, schools and gardaí. We must try to form a new respect for law and order in some of these communities. A good start has been made but we need to keep at it. We need to keep emphasising the problem, as Deputy Rabbitte says, and not forget about it when we get into our party rooms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to join with other speakers in paying tribute to Garda Tighe and Garda Padden who made the supreme sacrifice in the service of the guardians of the peace. It does not take their deaths to remind us of the severe problems which still exist in regard to criminality, especially in the suburbs of Dublin, but the Minister has outlined a very creditable record in his stewardship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>We have provided a very big increase in the allocation in the annual Estimates to the Garda Síochána. The strength of the Garda, at 11,700, is at an all time high. The scandal of the premature release of dangerous men and women has been ended and there are a record number of prison places as a result. We have also introduced a very substantial amount of legislation reforming and revising the criminal code. Despite all these very fine initiatives, problems remain. In suburban Dublin, one can witness the vandalism, deliberate destruction and criminal damage which create a built environment that holds up the mirror to the criminality that exists. We have multiple car damage, car thefts, break-ins and wanton violence at late hours involving young men and women. This has become a real problem. A cloud of intimidation hovers over certain districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" />I agree with the trend of what Deputies Noel Ahern and Rabbitte have said. Deputy Rabbitte said earlier that he did not believe a multiplication of gardaí, courts, jailers and prison places and a further multiplication of numbers would resolve all these problems. If there are dangerous men and women, no number of gardaí will restrain them. The Minister of State referred to tackling the social problems, but one of the creditable things this Administration has done is that it has tackled one of the biggest social problems that existed &ndash; unemployment. Anyone who visits not just local authority estates, but any estate in suburban Dublin, will see that the work incentive has been restored. That has happened because of a combination of tax reform and increased employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>We require a revision of social attitudes, specifically in respect of drink and intoxication, if we are to make progress with regard to the sad problem we are discussing. We cannot blame everything on social problems any more. There is a severe and persistent problem of wanton drunkenness. Putting out glossy brochures or suggesting that the teachers can educate children to be better will not resolve the problem. We have to raise the stakes for people who engage in this kind of conduct, and this has not been done.</P>
    <P>The accident and emergency units of our health service are constantly under pressure from a vast horde of people who are intoxicated either with drugs or alcohol at the weekends. This has put a huge strain on the health service. I accept that the problem of violence on the streets does not happen in all parts of the city, but it certainly happens in any parts where there are outlets for the sale of drink. We do not have any deterrent for people who are abusive when they are drunk because the gardaí are so busy dealing with the really hard cases that the routine cases &ndash; who should be arrested and sent to the cells for a night to realise the wrong in what they are doing, as an earlier generation was treated &ndash; are not dealt with. That deterrent does not exist any more because the gardaí are under such incredible pressure in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand on the eve of the general election why the Opposition tabled this motion, but I welcome it because it allows us put forward our own perspectives on this difficult issue. We have to revise our social attitudes in relation to abusing our own bodies with alcohol and drugs if we are to make progress. Simply calling for further gardaí and prison places will not address the problem.</P>
    <P>The case was well made by Deputy Noel Ahern a few moments ago that there is a need to have a long, hard look at the deployment of the gardaí. It is difficult, in any branch of the public service, to raise issues about deployment, but we need a greater deployment of gardaí at the hotspots. There is no question about that and speakers on all sides of the House would agree.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has a creditable record, which he outlined in the course of this debate. He <Col N="583" /> has initiated many good changes in the Department but, clearly, much remains to be done. I am happy to support the amendment as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the amendment and extend my sympathies to the families of the two gardaí who lost their lives so tragically at the weekend. It happened, oddly enough, on roughly the second anniversary of a similar incident where two gardaí died in my own constituency. We are aware of the trauma that such tragedy brings to colleagues of gardaí, their immediate family and the whole community.</P>
      <P>People are angry and are right to be so, but it is also time for a calm and cool assessment of our current position. Long before I became involved in politics we had a similar problem with joyriders in the 1970s &ndash; let us call them boy racers, which is the new name for them in my part of the country. Some of the characters who are now the most high-profile criminals and who are serving long jail sentences for drugs offences were the prime movers in that body of young criminals at the time. The Government response was twofold. It appointed, for the first time, some professional youth workers. Also, it built Trinity House in Lusk. The problem about building Trinity House in Lusk was probably that it was a half-finished project. Unfortunately, it is only today that the remainder of that project is being progressed and accelerated.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that extra gardaí have been appointed &ndash; 2,000 additional gardaí represent a very creditable performance on the part of the Minister. I know Fianna Fáil is committed to appointing more gardaí when it returns to power. However, one could put a garda at every street corner and crossroads and it would not solve the problems unless there was consent on the part of the community. The two most peaceful communities in the world ought to be Northern Ireland and South Africa if numbers of police had a bearing on the matter.</P>
      <P>Measures such as Operation Encounter in Dublin have made a real difference. My problem with Operation Oíche, Operation Cleanstreet and Operation Encounter is that an operation, by definition, starts and finishes. There has to be strong, firm and consistent policing. The laws exist &ndash; there is no shortage of them. The Public Order Act is in place. I pay tribute to the gardaí in my constituency who have been enforcing that Act very vigorously and it has made a difference, but it has made a difference only because they are working hard to do so. For example, on the night before last there were eight checkpoints in my constituency targeting the motorbikes which were being driven around at breakneck speed causing danger to motorcycle riders and the public. That problem will be tackled, but there will be another problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Constant co-operation and vigilance is required on the part of the Garda. It has certainly worked in Dublin North-West, where we have a habit of <Col N="584" /> meeting the senior gardaí on a monthly basis to discuss relevant issues. We are able to bring to their attention issues which we pick up on the streets and the area has benefited because of this. I welcome the sanction by the Minister to have a CCTV scheme for the Finglas area. The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, allocated £250,000 to the village project in Finglas in December, which is an alternative to custodial sentences run by the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>As the Minster of State, Deputy Ryan, said, we need to look at a wide range of alternatives. Expenditure on the youth facility in Ballymun and expenditure of &euro;20 million on a leisure centre for the Finglas area should have been provided years ago. However, at least we are now receiving the allocations and construction has started on the projects. I pay tribute to Deputy Eoin Ryan and his Department for the initiatives they have brought forward. We need to continue in this regard.</P>
    <P>If there was one pledge I would like all parties to make in this House, it would be to continue with this type of intervention. We cannot and should not lock up everybody. A correct signal has been given by the Minister last night in designating a prison as a suitable detention place for out-of-control youngsters. A small enough number of such people exists.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the next few weeks the remaining part of the Children Act, particularly the juvenile justice aspects, will be enacted. I have long held the view that we need to use legislation proactively. I see no reason why curfews could not be enforced. They are part of the juvenile justice aspect of the Children Act. It is important to put responsibility on parents for the misdemeanours of their children and to provide case conferences for what might be described as dysfunctional families &ndash; I do not like using that term but there are families who need support and they are not always single-parent families. Some families need constant support so the juvenile justice aspect of the Children Act needs to be put in place.</P>
    <P>On the licensing laws, I agree with Deputy Brian Lenihan about the gross abuse of alcohol and I find it impossible to understand that in the Dublin area, to the best of my knowledge, not one prosecution has been brought against a liquor licence holder for serving alcohol to underage youngsters. The public order Bill ought to be enacted by the next Government as quickly as possible because pubs and take-away shops make no attempt to control the congregation of unruly elements outside their premises, which often occurs in the early hours of the morning after the pubs close. Some pubs in my constituency dish people out onto the streets at 3.30 in the morning. That should not be allowed and the Garda will have to crack down on it. The law exists to do that.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment but we need to take a multifaceted approach. Simply locking these people up and throwing away the key will not <Col N="585" /> solve the problem. We need to bring forward a range of enlightened measures that will work.</P>

      <P>When the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was Opposition spokesperson on justice from 1995 to 1997, he was scathing and unrelenting in his criticism of the then Minister, Deputy Owen. When he was not condemning her and making personal attacks on her, he was making rash and exaggerated promises about what he would do if he became Minister. He has completed almost five years in office and it is now time to pass judgment on his term in office. That judgment, like his judgment of the former Minister, Deputy Owen, has to be harsh and damning.</P>
      <P>In opposition, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, spoke of zero tolerance, a buzzword imported from the United States. He also spoke about jamming the revolving door and preventing serious offenders from returning to the streets to offend again. Those promises must be embarrassing for the Government in the last week of this Dáil. Last weekend's tragic events in Stillorgan highlight the failure of the Government.</P>
      <P>Let us now examine the record of the Minister. The overall detection rate of crime for 2000 was 42%. In 1996, the crime detection rate was 41%, only a 1% increase for the zero tolerance Minister. Only one in four crimes committed are reported to the Garda. Almost half of all businesses were victims of crime in the past 12 months and in all there has been a 19% increase in crimes against business since the Government came to power in 1997. Businesses are losing approximately £775 million, or almost &euro;1 billion, per year as a result of crime and in 2000 there was a 131% increase in violent assaults causing bodily harm.</P>
      <P>The Minister's most significant legislative measure was to extend the licensing hours, which has contributed so much to the mayhem on our streets and the current public order problem. He extended the hours without providing the necessary numbers of gardaí to police the streets when drunken young people spill onto them at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. That has resulted in the violent attacks throughout the country which we are debating today.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to my constituency. I carried out a crime survey in Tralee based on the period from March 2000 to September 2001. Over 400 people responded to the survey but the Minister described it, in the prosaic language we are accustomed to hearing from him in this House, as balderdash. I am currently canvassing Tralee and I am aware that the people were not very happy with the Minister's reaction to my survey because they were the ones who responded to it. It was not a fictitious survey. A total of 400 people responded to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" />In the survey, 86% of the 400 people who responded said they did not feel safe walking Tralee town centre at night. There were six attacks on gardaí in Tralee in the Minister's constituency in November of last year, including one serious attack on a female garda. Some 90% of those who responded said the Government was not doing enough to prevent street crime and 98% said they wanted to see more gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>The Minister might claim responsibility in this House for increasing the number of gardaí throughout the country but the numbers of gardaí in Tralee have increased by approximately six since 1997 in a town that will have grown by approximately 7,000 or 8,000 people in the meantime. There is a huge influx of people into Tralee from across the country over the weekend, yet the six gardaí on the beat in the town cannot deal with the number of young people spilling out of the pubs at night.</P>
    <P>I also carried out a survey of Tralee businesses to which there was a very good response. Almost 50 businesses responded. In the period from January 2001 to March 2002, 64% of businesses were vandalised and 62% were burgled. A total of 72% of businesses reported a crime to the Garda Síochána, with 8% of the goods being retrieved. There were 16 convictions but those figures are a reflection of the current level of crime directed at business. The editorial in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> was excellent. It concluded:</P>
    <P>John O'Donoghue has had five years to put meat and bones on his cocky rhetoric. He has not done it. After this summer's election, let us hope that somebody else is given the task of making our towns and cities safe.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when Deputy Shatter will be Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter is a very capable Opposition spokesperson on justice. I want to see Fine Gael take over the crime problem. In the past, Fine Gael has been synonymous with justice and law and order. It was always known as the law and order party, and that is still the case. We need a firm but fair system of justice, otherwise the thugs who dominate our streets will take over. That is what is happening now. The gardaí need to be properly resourced in terms of manpower and equipment, but that is not happening.</P>
      <P>I would like to be able to acknowledge the contribution a Kerryman has made to tackling the problem of crime but, unfortunately, I am not in a position to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I would like to extend my condolences to the families of the two gardaí who were so tragically killed on Sunday night. It is unfortunate and sad that we should be discussing this issue against such a <Col N="587" /> backdrop but like many occurrences in this House over the years, we appear to be galvanised only when events like this are presented to us in such a stark fashion. Whether the Minister likes it or not and whether it is palatable to his constituents in County Kerry is immaterial &ndash; the zero tolerance policy which he espoused so colourfully five years ago has failed and it now lies in tatters around him. He should be ashamed of himself for coming in here at this time attempting to make excuses for the lack of law and order.</P>
      <P>Many of us have repeatedly brought to the attention of the House the incidence of young people coming before judges with a string of indictable offences. Every time we raise a question in the House about it, we are told procedures are in place, that the Minister is doing something about it, that there are three Ministers with different responsibilities in the area or that the matter will be resolved in due course. For the past ten years I have been hearing about how these issues were to be resolved, yet they are still around. It would be sad were it not for the fact that in the past five years there has been more revenue available to the Departments responsible than ever in the history of the State. What have the Ministers done? They have made excuses. In the past 24 hours the Taoiseach has said crime has changed. Crime has changed because it has been allowed to change, because it has not been tackled, because Ministers will not face up to their responsibilities and accept what is in front of their eyes. Only since the tragic events of recent days have they sat up and taken notice.</P>
      <P>What has been done in recent months? The crime figures have been massaged. We have new names for old crimes, such as &ldquo;headline offences&rdquo;, so that when statistics are produced one does not see the true picture. This is an absolute disgrace about which I have complained many times in the past. The crime figures are increasing rapidly. The Minister will reply that we now have more gardaí. So we have, but the population is almost double what it was in the 1950s so the situation is dramatically different. There are so many problems being faced by young people that are not being addressed. CCTV is supposed to be the answer to everything but it is not policing. There is a need for more gardaí on the street and their provision is a matter for the Ministers responsible. There is no use saying there are more gardaí than there were five or ten years ago because the need for them has been quadrupled since then. The sooner the relevant Ministers recognise that, the better for themselves and for the community at large.</P>

      <P>It is not policing and it should not be put forward as a panacea for crime. It only helps after the event, and there is far too much reliance on it. Eventually, police worldwide will recognise that CCTV is an inadequate substitute for poor policing. The number of gardaí the Minister has provided is totally inadequate, as he is well aware.</P>
      <P>Abuse of drink and drugs has got completely out of hand and I do not know whether there is any intention to do anything about it. However, the social services back-up required for families at risk in various areas is also lacking. There are no services and inadequate numbers of social workers. They have not been recruited and there are no plans to recruit them. There are major gaps in the social services whose effects show up later on in the crime figures. All that has been done by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by other Ministers is to massage the crime figures to make them incomprehensible so that the general public cannot recognise their seriousness.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the two gardaí who tragically lost their lives while performing their duty &ndash; Garda Tony Tighe and Garda Michael Padden. Many of my constituents have contacted me to say that they knew Garda Tighe and they could not say a bad word about the man. He had a very good reputation in the area and was always very friendly to people. I sympathise with the families of both men. It is a terrible time for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the previous speakers have referred to the rise in crime, which has certainly occurred. However, we should go back to root causes, as Deputy Ahern said, and focus particularly on the rise in lawlessness, which is a slightly different problem. We see this every day &ndash; it is a symptom of what is wrong with our society. With more money but less time we rush around, breaking red lights, having no time to talk to one another. This sort of stress engenders the lawlessness we see around us. We need to focus on this and on the root causes of crime. Alcohol abuse certainly plays a role. Deputy Ahern referred to the fact that people have more money. We should consider the type of pub that is popular nowadays, the super-pub. These are huge establishments in which the bar staff do not know who they are serving. People may be well on, as they say, yet continue to be served alcohol. This needs to <Col N="589" /> change. The licensing laws need to be changed because it is clearly wrong to continue to serve people who are already inebriated. We can see the results of this on our streets at night. It has led to the huge increase in public order offences.</P>
    <P>People are also concerned about joyriding &ndash; a very bad term, but the one commonly used. However, just as we glamorise alcohol, we glamorise cars. In a society in which the gap between rich and poor is increasing, as we know from the latest surveys &ndash; and the Government has fared badly in trying to reduce that gap &ndash; the only outlet is either alcohol or the fast car. How one gets one's hands on that fast car is another matter. It is ridiculous that although we have a speed limit of 70 mph, we have cars that can reach tremendous speeds such as 100 mph. As I have said before, cars and trucks should have what is called a governor to keep speeds down. If they did we would not be in the ridiculous situation of having to catch people speeding and speeding would become a thing of the past. In our society there is an inner, brooding discontent which is released through alcohol. We are living in times of great material advancement, yet we are seeing a kind of spiritual impoverishment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues that need to be addressed. We need more gardaí on the beat and this is so obvious that every speaker will probably refer to it. In Paris two weekends ago I saw policemen on roller-skates. If someone suggested that here they would probably be laughed at but it seemed to be very effective. In other cities one may see policemen on bicycles &ndash; a visible presence, as people want in this city. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform needs to make sure there is a visible presence to provide reassurance, particularly late at night, so that those who are making life miserable for so many people may be brought to justice. Many parts of the city have become no-go areas and people do not want to venture out at night. I want to see that change and I hope my colleagues on the Opposition benches feel likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members I wish to express sympathy to the families of Garda Tighe and Garda Padden who were so tragically and needlessly mown down on Sunday last. Their deaths are an indication of the type of situation that exists on our streets at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer, in particular, to the cancer of anti-social behaviour that is now prevalent in our cities and towns. I have raised this matter on numerous occasions in the House during the past 12 months by way of parliamentary questions and in contributions to Adjournment debates and Private Members' motions. The Minister has failed to respond to the need for community gardaí during that period. He certainly seems not to have grasped the fact that it is now absolutely necessary that gardaí be on the beat in towns, cities and housing estates. I am disappointed that the Minister, despite repeated requests, has failed to meet a deputation of local politicians from <Col N="590" /> south Tipperary in connection with this matter which was raised with him eight months ago. I raised this matter in the House on previous occasions and requested that he meet with the deputation but, unfortunately, he has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>We are hearing continual reports about the all-time high number of gardaí who are apparently in the employ of the State. I have tabled parliamentary questions regarding the number of gardaí in south Tipperary and the Minister has informed me, for example, that in the town of Clonmel there are 41 gardaí of all ranks. In practice, this means that in Clonmel and its hinterland, which have a population in the region of 25,000 to 30,000, there are at any one time six gardaí on duty who may either be in patrol cars or on the beat. That is completely inadequate. In the town in which the Minister lives, Tralee, which is slightly smaller than Clonmel, there are 70 gardaí. The local superintendent and Garda management in south Tipperary have requested the deployment of community gardaí in the area but they have not received a response or approval of that request to date.</P>
    <P>I am approached on a regular basis by constituents who inform me that there is no point in reporting crime. The Garda Síochána is doing an excellent job to the best of its ability, but with very limited resources and inadequate manpower. Members of the public believe there is little point in reporting crime to the Garda, which means that anything up to 50% of crime is not being reported and the problem of anti-social activity in towns and villages is not being dealt with. I could name up to 20 families who have been driven out of their homes in the past 12 months as a result of anti-social behaviour. Having been driven out, they were then discriminated against by the local authority which will not allow them to put their names on the housing waiting list. I call for the deployment of community gardaí on the beat, not just in south Tipperary but throughout the country.</P>

      <P>In supporting this motion, I begin by refuting the many allegations made in recent times that Sinn Féin is involved in vigilantism. These allegations from our political opponents have been orchestrated in the run-up to the forthcoming general election. This is a cynical party political exercise which has nothing whatever to do with vigilantism or crime, but is an attempt to frighten voters from supporting Sinn Féin. It is a deliberate diversion and a distraction from the real issues with which people are concerned. I wish to make it patently clear that vigilantism has no part to play in the response needed to the ever-increasing cycle of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the motion itself and the growing toll of violent crime and anti-social behaviour. I sympathise with the families of Garda Michael Padden and Garda Tony Tighe who were tragically killed last Sunday. They are <Col N="591" /> the latest fatal victims of the growing anti-social scourge which is claiming lives in violent circumstances.</P>
    <P>In this case, it was so-called joyriding which led to the deaths of the two gardaí. In the communities in Dublin where this nightly menace is at its worst, there is no surprise at these fatalities. The wonder is that many more individuals have not been killed as young people career through built-up residential areas at top speed, placing members of their own communities under virtual curfew. It is a disgrace that no attempt has been made by the Government during the term of this Dáil to address the scourge of so-called joyriding. The Bill in the name of Deputy Broughan could and should have been accepted by the Government, which was free to make any amendments it deemed necessary and to have them debated here.</P>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable that there are inadequate places for young offenders. We have learned today that both of the young people being questioned in connection with last Sunday's burglary, car theft and death of the gardaí, were actually turned away from detention centres because there was no room for them. Clearly the system is not working at this level and people who are a danger to the community and to themselves are not being detained.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which must be addressed at many levels. The motion highlights the estimate that only one in four assaults are reported to the Garda. I know from colleagues in Dublin and elsewhere that this figure is, if anything, an underestimate and that the range of other serious offences, including joyriding and drug dealing, is routinely unreported. Why is this? The reality is that people believe their reports to the Garda will be totally ineffective.</P>
    <P>Growing levels of crime are by no means confined to our large cities and towns. During my canvas in the town of Bailieboro, County Cavan, in my constituency earlier in the week, the issue of anti-social behaviour and general lawlessness was raised on a number of occasions. People highlighted the absence of effective policing at the critical hours where the pattern of drink-fuelled lawlessness, threatening behaviour and damage to property has already been well established. While there are no quick-fix solutions to any of these problems, I believe that at all levels we must collectivise and ensure that there is an adequate response to meet the community's concerns and needs.</P>

      <P>I support the motion tabled by my party. The difficulty faced by the Government is that it made such a major issue of this in the run-up to the last election and accounted political responsibility to the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen. Now that the heat is on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is clear he cannot take it. He has made a fool of himself in recent weeks in terms of the comments he has made. In my opinion, there is a question of political responsibility attaching to this issue. The fact is that, as I understand it, there are 31 places available nationally to detain youths who are out of control. As the previous speaker stated, it has now come into the public domain that one of those who was involved in the tragic events of last weekend had previously come before the courts. It was clear that the courts wanted this person assessed and put in a hostel for a period, none of which happened because of the difficulties between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Why was this allowed to happen? Why was there no tracking system in place? This youth, who was out of control last weekend, should have been detained.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of genuine public concern. Many thousands of youths in this city, not all of whom come from difficult family circumstances, are out of control. Repeatedly, parents have approached me and asked that I do everything in my power to ensure their children are removed from their control because they simply cannot control them. This demonstrates the frustration parents feel when the State figuratively puts its hands in the air and says it can do nothing about youths who are continually involved in crime. This issue must be resolved and this can only happen by detaining those who are involved on a continuous basis in anti-social activity and crime. Unless the State intervenes directly to put people away for a considerable period, we will not see results.</P>
      <P>The Government has had five years to dramatically increase detention places. Regardless of what announcements we may hear next week or the week after that, this has not happened, which is a matter of concern not just to the people of this city but to those in urban areas throughout the country. Nothing has happened to ensure that our streets are safer and these uncontrollable kids are taken out of the community. They are a harm to themselves, the community around them and the law enforcement agency and something has to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé thar a bheith sásta cúpla focal a rá ag an ócáid seo. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform comprehensively addressed many of the specific issues raised by Opposition Deputies yesterday evening. Not only does the Government remain prepared to stand over its record of achievement in office and be <Col N="593" /> judged on it, but last night the Minister also laid bare the empty rhetoric of many of those on the opposite benches who would seek to criticise him.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Minister demonstrated yet again that he was quite prepared to tackle difficult issues head on when he announced yesterday evening that he had obtained Government approval in principle yesterday for the redesignation of an existing prison or part of a prison in order that the courts can be guaranteed that the small number of serious young offenders, whose presence in the community constitutes a serious threat to the rights of law abiding citizens, can if necessary be accommodated. As he informed the House, officials in his Department, the Prison Service and the Department of Education and Science will be settling the details for the provision of this additional remand accommodation as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Government shares public concern about the incidence of violent assaults and the worrying anti-social behaviour of some young people. It should be noted, however, that although law enforcement has a crucial role to play in dealing with these problems, many of these crimes also require a change in behaviour and attitudes. On this note, every Deputy will know all too well the personal and social costs associated with the misuse of alcohol and drugs. As a result, extra demands are placed on the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prison service. Until the Government took office, these vital services were denied the resources they needed to manage at even minimal levels. The record high crime figures we experienced under the previous Government were the inevitable result.</P>
      <P>Any fair minded observer will concede that we have addressed the enormous problems we inherited with unprecedented resources and legislation and have been successful in tackling crime and the causes of crime. As the Deputies heard yesterday evening, the Minister has enacted an unprecedented 46 Bills in office, many of which are designed to ensure criminals will be caught, brought before the courts and dealt with accordingly.</P>
      <P>More than 1,200 new prison spaces have been built and the drugs treatment programmes in prisons have been expanded. The number of prisoners on temporary release has been reduced dramatically. In 1997 the number of prisoners on temporary release stood at 500, by October 2001 this had dropped to 150. Those on temporary release are, for the main, on structured programmes designed to reintegrate them into society on completion of their sentences. The current strength of the Garda Síochána is more than 11,700 and overall numbers are on course to reach 12,000 by the end of this year as promised in our programme for Government. This will constitute the greatest number of gardaí in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequence of this is a more visible Garda presence on the streets, which has been apparent to members of the public, particularly <Col N="594" /> following public house and night club closing at weekends. A major expansion of Garda CCTV systems is under way to enhance public safety on our streets and a planned new mobile CCTV unit will significantly enhance the ability of the Garda to tackle disorder. It is anticipated that these systems will be installed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The results are clear. The Opposition may like to play games with the statistics, but the bottom line is the same &ndash; a vast improvement on its pitiful performance in Government. In the light of all that was said by the Minister yesterday evening and my contribution this morning, I have no hesitation in commending to the House the Minister's amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will share time with Deputies Enright and Shatter. Despite having huge respect for the Deputy opposite, she is showing alarming complacency about what is happening on the streets of Dublin. To suggest the Minister is on top of everything and has secured tremendous achievements far superior than those of the rainbow Government is to engage in hollow politics. The Minister should not be turning out scripts provided by officials or whoever is operating the script machine.</P>
      <P>The reality is that, while crime against property has declined with growing prosperity and declining unemployment, wanton violence on the street is rampant. Last week alone, five people, apart from the two gardaí, were killed in stabbings, shootings or other violent incidents. Such killings are commonplace on the streets of Dublin. Just up the road from my home, a poor Chinese man was beaten to death. This is the nature of Dublin life at present.</P>
      <P>In our efforts to get to grips with this issue, we on this side of the House have done surveys on how people feel about crime. We found alarming fear with 90% of people afraid to go out at night alone. What is worse is that they have very low confidence in either the deployment and management of the Garda to tackle this sort of problem or the effectiveness and fairness of the courts to deal with it.</P>
      <P>There is an alarming collapse of confidence in the criminal justice system. The instances which hit the headlines in the past week are just the tip of the iceberg. I have here well known figures from the emergency departments of the northside hospitals. Last year Beaumont Hospital dealt with 1,012 assaults, the James Connolly Memorial Hospital dealt with 687, while the Mater Hospital has still not got to grips with recording the number of assault cases. Therefore, there are some 3,000 cases of violent assault turning up in the accident and emergency departments of hospitals on the northside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the Garda figures for the northside. These show that 260 assault offences were deemed worthy of recording as headline assaults during the same period, which is less than one in ten of the number appearing at the accident and emergency departments. Of these only 104 <Col N="595" /> resulted in proceedings. Therefore, of 3,000 people who turned up at our accident and emergency departments, proceedings were taken in slightly more than 100 cases.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that people have lost confidence in the ability of the Garda and the criminal justice system to get to grips with the problem. It is not enough to wheel out hollow slogans like zero tolerance. The reality is that 2,900 people got away with assault having avoided criminal proceedings while in 100 cases proceedings were taken. That is not zero tolerance or the way to address a serious emerging problem. I understand the Minister of State and her colleagues panicking to find places to put these disturbed young people who are out of control, as Deputy Brian Hayes said. However, that is not enough. We have the worst figures in Europe for recidivism. Young people who go into institutions do not come out less likely to reoffend but more likely to do so. We need to seriously consider the way we handle young offenders.</P>
    <P>I was shocked when I discovered that the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, which we passed after years of waiting, still have not been brought into effect. They were supposed to offer alternative ways to handle such children. As Deputy Brian Hayes said, we all meet parents on the streets in Dublin who are appealing for help because they cannot control their young children. They cannot deal with what is happening to them at night. We must address that reality. Platitudes about places and statistics ring hollow in the ears of many people around the streets of Dublin. It is a big issue and it will require root and branch reform. It will not be achieved quickly or by slogans. I hope we will be in government after the election because we have done a lot of research and we are anxious and able to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>There are few people listening to this serious debate. However, it will not be conducted or won by the behaviour we have seen from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While his performance in the House is combative and will probably win applause from his backbenchers, it does not help us to get to grips with this serious issue. Government members will discover that when they knock on doors during the election campaign. The Minister of State may not be knocking on doors on the north side of the city or in part of Deputy Brian Hayes's constituency. However, when she knocks on doors, she will find the response will not be what she expects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seriously worried that the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, appears to have lost total control of crime and street violence which has resulted in the past week in the deaths of six people, including two members of the Garda <Col N="596" /> Síochána who died in the course of their duty. When one considers that in 2000 there was an increase of 113% in assaults causing grievous bodily harm and that only one in four assaults are reported to the Garda, the situation is serious. What is worse is that the Government is refusing to accept these facts. Something is seriously wrong at Government level, particularly in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. The Minister was all bluff and bluster in opposition. However, now that he is in charge of the Department he has clearly failed in his responsibilities and duties.</P>
      <P>A clear example of that was his abject failure in the Patrick Naughton affair. When the issue was debated in the House yesterday, the Minister said: &ldquo;Replies are signed by me or on my behalf, but rarely would I have time personally to study the detail of such representations or replies, given the overall volume involved&rdquo;. I accept and understand that, but we are dealing with an appalling incident of child sexual abuse by a father on his daughter. This was a case of incest, rape and buggery. The father warned his daughter that if he got out of prison, he would put a stone around her stomach and drown her in a lake. Nine letters were written by the Minister to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and six letters were written by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to the Minister. Yet the Minister claims he knew nothing about the correspondence. If that is true, the situation is totally out of control. There should be a warning system to alert the Minister if someone writes about a court case.</P>
      <P>It may have seemed like a good idea for the Government to direct 25% of budget give-aways to the richest 10% of the population and only 5% to the poorest 20% in the past five years. However, that has contributed to Ireland being one of the most unequal countries in the European Union with one of the highest rates of relative income poverty. There is a high price to be paid by all citizens who have experienced crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> was attributed to a Dublin garda who knows the gang involved in the crime spree which led to the deaths of his two fellow officers. He said they do not rate as criminals in their own area and many of the crimes they commit are not investigated by a detective. That is a highly disquieting statement since the experience of other countries and cities, such as New York, is that crime can only be reduced effectively when it is nipped in the bud at an early stage of a young person's life. What is the price of zero tolerance now? The garda put his finger on it when he said that many young people cannot be controlled by their parents. They seem to be in trouble from the age of seven or eight. That is probably the time the State should move in before a serious problem arises. Many professionals, such as social workers, are aware that the control of children in such cases begins to deteriorate from their toddler years. Research in the United States shows that money <Col N="597" /> spent on early childhood and education results in big savings later. We are asking that an effort be made to help these young people at an early age.</P>
    <P>The situation is getting worse. The Minister for Education and Science admitted this morning that the two young boys who caused the deaths of two gardaí should have been in custody at the time. However, they were out on the streets because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is full of bluff and bluster, has allowed crime to run rampant. It is time he resigned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members of the Opposition who contributed to this debate. I cannot extend similar thanks to those on the Government side who engaged in the usual defence of the Minister's position. While one or two were willing to admit there was some problem, none of them was willing to acknowledge the extent of the Government's responsibility for the problems with which we are now confronted. Last night the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform served us the usual menu of self-congratulations, bombast, misinformation, public relations spin and foolishness. I do not intend to spend any more time analysing his speech as that aptly sums it up.</P>
      <P>One thing is clear, namely, that the Government's juvenile justice policy is a total shambles. In the Dáil this morning the Minister for Education and Science admitted that there are only 31 remand places available to enable juveniles under 16 years of age who are charged with serious offences to be held in custody pending trial. That is only 31 remand places to serve the entire country. He also acknowledged that the Government's scandalous failure to provide the places required resulted in one of the teenagers in the car which caused the tragic deaths of Garda Tony Tighe and Garda Michael Padden not being held on remand last year because Oberstown House was full. Astonishingly, he also admitted that in early February of this year Finglas assessment centre recommended that one of the teenagers in the car should reside in a hostel under the supervision of the probation and welfare service. However, to date that recommendation has not been implemented.</P>
      <P>Apparently the teenager failed to turn up for a subsequent appointment with the probation and welfare service. If he did, it was the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure, if necessary, that he was apprehended by the Garda Síochána and brought back before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" />The Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should explain what action was taken to implement the recommendation made last February by the Finglas centre. They must also indicate what action was taken to draw to the attention of the court this teenager's failure to co-operate with the implementation of the recommendations received.</P>
    <P>Last night in the Dáil, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that 20 places for juveniles under 16 years of age are being made available at St. Patrick's Institute in Dublin. It emerged this morning that no arrangements have as yet been agreed between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science to implement this proposal. Neither Minister can state by what date these places will become available and, for the time being, there will remain only 31 remand places available for such juveniles. As we speak, a teenager charged with car offences who was yesterday to be placed in a remand centre is being held at Tallaght Garda station. He could not be placed in the centre because no place was available.</P>
    <P>Both Ministers must clarify when the additional remand places will become available and should state when it is intended to make the necessary order required to ensure this use of St. Patrick's for remand juveniles is not open to legal challenge. The order required is also supposed to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Government's total failure over five years to meet needs in this area has been, in a very tragic way, totally exposed over the past week. The Government's juvenile justice policy can best be described as chaotic. The approach of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Education and Science can best be described as one of criminal neglect, and on the part of the Minister for Education and Science as sustained in the House today, one of total ignorance of what is happening in his Department and within an area for which he has direct responsibility and accountability to this House.</P>
    <P>We need a new Government with a commitment to tackle the problems in this area. I doubt if there is any possibility that the motion from this side of the House will be passed this afternoon. However, it should be and deserves to be passed. We need a new Government with a different approach which will move away from political sloganeering and which will reclaim the streets for the wider community so that people feel safe on our streets and no longer under threat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998 (No. 39 of 1998), shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June 2002. Members of this House will need no reminding of the circumstances in which these provisions were <Col N="604" /> enacted in 1998, that is the Omagh bomb in August of that year. There was a determination, nowhere more so than in this House, that those responsible for this mass murder would not succeed in subverting the democratically expressed will of the people on this island that the conflict should be resolved only by peaceful means and on the basis of consent. To date, one person has been convicted in this jurisdiction on a charge related to the Omagh bomb and the investigation is continuing with excellent co-operation between the Garda and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The Garda Síochána will not give up the search for those responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that, in recognition of the particular circumstances surrounding the enactment of the provisions of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas to see if the circumstances then prevailing justified the continuance in force of its provisions or whether there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to convince the Oireachtas that the provisions were no longer needed. Under section 18 of the Act, therefore, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1999, and by virtue of resolutions passed by each House of the Oireachtas first on 20 June 2000 and more recently on 26 June 2001, sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 will cease to operate on and from 30 June 2002 unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for such period not exceeding 12 months as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
    <P>Included also in the Act was a requirement on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform laid such a report before this House on 17 April. The conclusion of that report is that the renewal of the provisions for a further year is necessary. The sad reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bomb continue to pursue and plan a campaign of violence and that there is no change of substance to the circumstances which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the individual sections, which this House is asked to continue in force for a further 12 months, outline their purpose and indicate where they have been utilised in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings against a person for membership of an unlawful organisation, evidence is given that the accused when questioned failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. This provision has been utilised on many occasions in questioning persons arrested on suspicion of being members of an unlawful organisation. Charges do not of course <Col N="605" /> result in every case in which the provision is used, but since 1 June 2001, charges were preferred in 22 cases in which section 2 was utilised. Two of these cases resulted in a conviction, while the remaining cases are currently before the courts. In addition, three persons were convicted during the period under report having been charged prior to that period in cases where this section was utilised.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act provides that, in proceedings for an offence of membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise. This section was utilised by accused persons on two occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972. The effect of the 1972 provision is that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of such an organisation, shall be evidence that he or she was then such a member. It originally defined the expression &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 of the 1998 Act was to expand the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; to include movements, actions, activities or associations. This simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts, and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged, but did not do so. This section was utilised on 13 occasions in the past nine months.</P>
    <P>Section 6 established the offence of, at any level of the organisation's structure, directing the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act, 1939. While this section was not utilised during the period under report, one person remains before the courts having been charged with such an offence prior to that period.</P>
    <P>Section 7 made it an offence for a person to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences. This section was utilised on 20 occasions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" />Section 8 made it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Two persons were convicted under this section in the period under report, having been charged prior to that period.</P>
    <P>Section 9 made it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for such an offence, and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána. This section was utilised on 115 occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act &ndash; which otherwise is 48 hours &ndash; to 72 hours on the authorisation of a District Court judge. The judge must be satisfied, on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make submissions, or have them be made, on his or her behalf. In the past year, 39 persons have had their periods of detention extended under this provision and five of those were subsequently charged with offences.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence and about which they wish to question the suspect.</P>
    <P>Section 12 made it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives, or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 14 is to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing such offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act. This section was utilised on 56 occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, for the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person <Col N="607" /> which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.</P>
    <P>This information on the use made of these provisions of the 1998 Act over the past nine months is based on information received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies. This report, together with the previous report, shows that the key provisions of the Act are taking effect. We are now seeing the results of this legislation with, during the past nine months, the section 2 provision for adverse inferences being used in 22 cases, resulting in two convictions and 20 pending charges, and with two persons convicted under section 8 in relation to information likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation.</P>
      <P>The most significant result in the Garda Síochána's fight against subversive activity was the conviction of a person on a charge of conspiracy to cause an explosion in relation to the Omagh atrocity. The provisions of the 1998 Act were used appropriately by the Garda Síochána in this case and will continue to be used in their efforts to bring to justice all of those responsible for that horrific act.</P>

    <P>At the same time, it should be noted that the number of persons held under extended detention under section 10 over the past year was 39, a relatively modest number and one which, taken together with all of the other information I have outlined, goes to support my view that the pro<Col N="608" /> visions of the Act are reasoned and proportionate and are being implemented by the Garda Síochána in a measured and restrained manner.</P>
    <P>There are some provisions which did not take effect in the context of court proceedings during the period under report, but even here the Garda authorities have informed the Minister that the provisions in question have been utilised where appropriate by the Garda Síochána during the investigation of offences. Members of this House will appreciate that many of the investigations at issue are, of their nature, ongoing.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has had considerable success over the past nine months in combating those who, through the use of violence, would subvert the democratic wishes of the people on this island. I am sure the House will join me in congratulating the force on its achievements, but the threat to life and to our democratic values, which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act, remains. So, too, does the determination of this House never to give in to such a threat, but to provide the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system with all legitimate means of combating it. The 1998 Act is an important part of those means. It is proving its worth and I ask the House to continue it in force.</P>
    <P>In addition to these security concerns which alone would justify the continuance in force of these provisions, there is another consideration in favour of their continuance. The Offences against the State Acts, including the 1998 Act, are currently under review by a committee under the chairmanship of the former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, on foot of a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement. I understand that the final report from the review is imminent. It clearly would make no sense to allow the provisions of the 1998 Act to lapse before the committee reported its conclusions on those very provisions.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in the implementation of the peace process and much remains to be done. However, there are still those who would threaten to subvert that process through violence. The 1998 Act is part of the democratic response to that threat and I ask the House to continue in force the relevant provisions of that Act for a further 12 months.</P>

      <P>None of us will forget that dreadful day in August 1998 when an appalling atrocity visited murder and mayhem on the streets of Omagh and destroyed the lives of so many people going about their daily business and social life. The legislation which was enacted and which we are now addressing was introduced in response to that appalling atrocity. The Fine Gael party fully supports its continuation in force to assist the Garda Síochána in its very important task of protecting all of us on this island against subversive crime. The Garda authorities, as the Minister of State has said, have indicated that, in view of the current <Col N="609" /> security threat assessment, especially the continuing threat posed by dissident republican groups and international terrorist groups, it is considered necessary that the relevant sections of this Act remain in force. The Garda Síochána deserves the full support of all sides of this House in its very important and dangerous work in trying to counteract subversive crime. The difficulties it confronts are now exacerbated by the added dangers posed by international terrorist organisations which may, at some stage, use this State as a base to conduct terrorist activities that would impact not only on this island but on the wider world.</P>
      <P>In that context, it is important that the relevant powers remain available to the Garda Síochána and that, in this democracy, we utilise the legislation available to us to protect our democratic values and civil society. We must not allow small groups of dissident organisations on this island to subvert the democratic will of the Irish people in favour of progressing the peace process and bringing an end to shootings and bombings of the nature we have seen in the past. In that context, I fully support the proposal before the House and fully agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister of State. The Garda Síochána has our full support for the continuing availability to them of this important legislation.</P>

      <P>This is the third occasion on which I have spoken on the continuance in force of this particular set of measures which was originally introduced in September 1998 as temporary measures to meet the requirements of the situation which faced the country in the aftermath of the Omagh atrocity. All of us still reel in horror at the memory of the worst single incident in 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, which left almost 30 people dead, scores maimed and the heart of the town of Omagh devastated. We faced a dreadful vista and we determined, on all sides of the House, that those who perpetrated that dreadful act should be found. It was considered that the enactment of those special measures would enable the Garda Síochána and the then RUC to track down those who were responsible and bring them to account. It is a matter of regret that in this jurisdiction only one individual has been charged. I hope other charges will be brought and that convictions will be secured. This unspeakable act should never be forgotten and the pursuit of those responsible should be unrelenting and open-ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available, I wish to refer to the broader issue of the Offences against the State Acts. In her speech, the Minister of State referred to the review of the Offences against the State Act set up in 1998 by the current Government, under Mr. Justice Hederman. In reply to parliamentary questions, I have been told repeatedly that the conclusion of that review is &ldquo;imminent&rdquo;, a word used again today in the Minister of State's script. An interim report was published in August of last year. I ask the Minister of State to outline the Government's current general think<Col N="610" /> ing in relation to the future of the Offences against the State Act and what actions have been taken in relation to the interim report that was laid before the House and sent to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in the middle of last year. Is it envisaged that the Special Criminal Court will continue in place? Will it be restructured as recommended in the interim report?</P>
    <P>Some of the interim recommendations have been included in the most recent courts Bill, to ensure that the status and standing of those who are members of the Special Criminal Court would be the same as any other judge and that is certainly an advance. The majority recommended that any resolution establishing the Special Criminal Court should automatically lapse within a defined timeframe, unless there was a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas to continue it &ndash; the same regime that applies to these provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. I would like to have the Minister of State's response in that regard. The objective should be to re-establish normal jurisprudence in this State. We hope the subversive threat to the State, although not gone, is diminished. Those involved in the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA still pose a real threat to the stability and structure of our democracy and they must be met with resolute determination by all who are engaged in the democratic process and who wish to uphold the values of democracy. For that reason, the Labour Party will not object to the continuation, for another year, of the sections of the 1998 Act referred to in the motion now before the House. However, I hope the broader review of the Offences against the State Act &ndash; the final report of the Hederman committee &ndash; will be debated in this House before too long, so that we can structure our Judiciary and jurisprudence in a way that better reflects a normal democracy, rather than a society under threat. We need to move out of the dark period of our history and, hopefully, we will move into a period of jurisprudence in which democracy is not under threat from subversive agents who wish to have their way, not through force of argument but through force of arms and bombs. In supporting and endorsing the continuation in effect of these particular provisions, I would like to hear the general view of the Government as to the future in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>When the Act referred to in the motion before the House was originally introduced in Dáil Éireann, I sternly opposed it and I oppose its renewal. My party, the Socialist Party, is organised North and South on this island and has, for 30 years, opposed the tactics of the paramilitary organisations and sectarian organisations who inflict violence on either their own communities or others. We have stood four square against small groups who essentially believed they could inflict a particular viewpoint on society through the methods of the bomb or <Col N="611" /> sectarian associations. I wish to reiterate that the campaign of the paramilitaries was a massive waste in terms of lives lost. It was also a waste of the lives of young people from both sides of society who were drawn into paramilitary and sectarian activities. Many of their lives were lost or destroyed as well as the lives of the victims of these organisations.</P>
      <P>On many occasions we advocated that the only solution to the problem in Northern Ireland was the coming together in a united campaign of Protestant and Catholic working class people to resolve the problems both sections of the community faced equally. That could only be achieved on the basis of the unity of Protestant and Catholic working people. We realised that the British Establishment and State was guilty of enormously repressive actions within the North of Ireland, that its interests there did not coincide with the interests of the majority of working class people on either side of the divide and that the actions taken, including repressive measures, occasional atrocities and the victimisation of communities, was done in the interests of the Establishment and not the greater society.</P>
      <P>We have always opposed the State taking on to itself extremely repressive and far reaching legislation, such as the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. In the Dáil debate following the horrific atrocity at Omagh, I pointed out that this was not the way to approach this problem. We are concerned here with a handful of individuals on this island who continue to believe that individual acts of terrorism, such as the awful atrocity at Omagh, will bring about the change which they believe to be necessary. In response, the Legislature has introduced extremely repressive legislation which has serious civil rights implications.</P>
      <P>Once a law is on the Statute Book it applies to everybody and every occasion. It is not simply confined to those responsible for the act that caused the Government to introduce this legislation. There have been instances where the original offences against the State legislation has been used for trawling or intimidation purposes against those who were not members of paramilitary organisations. The legislation gives far reaching powers to the authorities for detention, questioning and so on. It should not be allowed by those who want to respect the civil and democratic rights of everybody on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Offences against the State Act deals with far more than the activities of paramilitary organisations, as I have pointed out in previous debates. For example, a peaceful protest movement of civil disobedience, which might call for the boycott of a tax or a charge levied by a public authority, such as the campaign in the greater Dublin and other areas against the new bin taxes levied on working people, could, under the Offences against the State Acts, be considered a most grievous offence. This would mean that the activities of those involved in campaigns of civil <Col N="612" /> disobedience, similar to the anti-poll tax campaign in Britain, which was a mass campaign involving millions of people, could be seriously curtailed and criminalised.</P>
    <P>The motion renewing this far-reaching repressive measure should not be dealt with in the last few days of this Dáil. There should be a full debate on the issue. There is no need for the Government to rush through this motion today. It calls for the renewal of the relevant sections of the 1998 Act for a further 12 months commencing on 30 June 2002. A new Dáil will have been convened after the general election before that date, when there will then be adequate time to hold a wide-ranging debate on the principles and the draconian provisions of the legislation. For this reason I am opposed to the motion. I favour entirely different methods of resolving the issues within Northern Ireland which the Government states this legislation is required to address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Shatter, Howlin and Higgins for their contributions and I also thank Deputies Shatter and Howlin for their support for the continuance of the provisions of this Act. We all recognise that much progress has been made on the path to peace since the Good Friday Agreement, but we equally recognise that there are people who wish to use violence to advance their aims. They are not part of the peace process.</P>
      <P>As a Government it is our duty to do everything we can to protect people and to ensure that atrocities such as the one at Omagh do not recur. That is why this legislation was introduced in 1998. It contains tough provisions. I was a backbench Deputy at the time of the debate and I recall saying that I did not like having to be in a situation where legislation of this kind was required.</P>
      <P>It is important that the responsibility of the Garda in using the provisions of the Act should be highlighted. It has been very effective and a number of the provisions have been used in the past 12 months. That the House must every 12 months debate and decide whether to continue with them means that the power of the legislation rests with the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not wish the legislation to be in force <i>ad infinitum.</i> We would like to be in the situation where peace here was such and our democracy was so strong North and South that we would be able to do without it. However, it plays a major and crucial role in the fight against subversive activity, which we know is occurring. It is having an effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked about the other legislation under review. An interim report on the Offences against the State Act, 1998, was prepared and its findings will be considered in the context of the final report, as that is also due. A copy of the interim report was given to the human rights commission for its information and <Col N="613" /> any decisions taken by the Government on foot of it will be advised to the commission. That will be for the next Government to decide. The deliberations of the committee will contribute to our thinking on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is important that as a House of the Oireachtas, the Dáil reaffirms its commitment to the peace process and our resolve to ensure that people who want to use violence will not be allowed do so. It is also important that we put in place the procedures and mechanisms which stop them in their tracks. One of those mechanisms is the 1998 Act, with which we are dealing here. That is why I thank the House and the Members who have agreed to the continuance of its provisions for another 12 months.</P>

      <P>These amendments apply to sections 4(<i>a</i>)(<i>h</i>) and 4(<i>h</i>)(<i>d</i>) and 5(<i>b</i>)(3B)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill as initiated following representations from Positive Action and Transfusion Positive. The section provides that the tribunal would hear claims from the spouses of persons infected with HIV in respect of the loss of consortium of the infected person, including the impairment of sexual relations with that person arising from the risk of transmission of HIV. In sexual relations the medical advice is that the risk of transmission of HIV is significantly higher than the risk of transmission of hepatitis C. Nevertheless, following representations from Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, I accept that the spouses of those who were infected with hepatitis C should be entitled to make such claims in similar circumstances.</P>

      <P>In page 6, paragraph (<i>c</i>), to delete lines 1 to 7 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) Where a person infected with Hepatitis C and HIV who has not made a claim for compensation to the Tribunal before the commencement of the <i>Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act, 2002, <Col N="615" /></i>makes a claim in respect of both conditions after such commencement, then, the Tribunal may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, hear and determine both claims together.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment applies to section 4(<i>c</i>) of the Bill and follows representations from the Irish Haemophilia Society. It is common practice in the High Court to join claims and hear them as one where similar circumstances apply to both. This procedure serves to save duplication, delay and costs. The Bill, as initiated, contained a provision to ensure that claimants who were co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV or dependants of co-infected persons who intended to make a claim following the commencement of the Act would make one claim only in respect of both conditions.</P>
    <P>The Irish Haemophilia Society has told me that in some cases because of the complexity of the issues involved it would be preferable that the tribunal would hear the hepatitis C claims separately from the HIV claims. In view of this, I am moving this amendment which will allow the tribunal to decide whether or not it would be appropriate to hear the claims separately. This amendment will ensure that the same rules will apply to claimants who intend to make claims in respect of both hepatitis C and HIV following the commencement of the Act, as will apply under section 4(<i>c</i>)(<i>d</i>) of the Bill to those who have already made a claim of hepatitis C but have not had that claim determined and intend to make a HIV claim following the commencement date.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 8, paragraph (<i>b</i>), lines 56 and 57, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 56, down to and including &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 57, and in page 9, lines 1 and 2, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;who&rdquo; in line 1, down to and including &ldquo;where HIV&rdquo; in line 2, and substitute &ldquo;paragraph (<i>e</i>) or (<i>j</i>) of section 4(1) is the child, spouse or parent of the person who died (&lsquo;the deceased') as a result of having contracted Hepatitis C or HIV, or where Hepatitis C or HIV&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment applies to section 5(<i>b</i>)(3B)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill, as initiated, following representations from the Irish Haemophilia Society, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive. The Bill, as initiated, provides that certain dependants, children and spouses of those HIV infected persons who have died as a result of their HIV infection could make a claim to the compensation tribunal in respect of the loss of society of the deceased, including the loss of the care, companionship and affection of the deceased. Following representations from the society I am extending these claims to apply to the parents of those HIV persons who have died. In addition, following representations from Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, I am extending the provision to the children, spouses and parents of those hepatitis C infected persons who have died. I indicated that last night in my Second Stage speech and this is the amendment which covers the issue of loss of society.<Col N="618" /></P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 seem to be covered by the Minister's amendment. I am not quite sure that amendment No. 11 is covered by it. I might just dwell on this for a moment. The Minister's amendment inserts &ldquo;the child, spouse or parent of the person who died (&lsquo;the deceased') as a result of having contracted Hepatitis C or HIV, or where Hepatitis C or HIV&rdquo;, whereas the amendment in the my name and that of Deputy McManus reads &ldquo;where Hepatitis C was a significant contributory factor to the cause of death, the Tribunal may make an award to that dependant in respect of loss of society of the deceased including the loss of the care, companionship and affection of the deceased as a result of the death&rdquo;. Are the broad proposals in our amendment encompassed by the Minister's amendment or does his amendment reduce in any way the effect of the amendment we are proposing?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph (<i>b</i>), lines 19 to 23, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;Tribunal&ndash;&rdquo; in line 19, down to and including &ldquo;(ii) may&rdquo; in line 23 and substitute &ldquo;Tribunal may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which applies to section 5(<i>b</i>)(3D) of the Bill, results from representations from the Irish Haemophilia Society. The section, as initiated, provided that the tribunal would be enabled, but not obliged, to consider any previous award made to a claimant when determining the additional compensation due. The intention here was to ensure there is no duplication of compensation in respect of the same heads of damages and this is in line with the principles of tort law as followed in the High Court. However, we have taken legal advice on the matter and I am satisfied that section 5(1) of the principal Act, which provides that the awards made by the tribunal shall be made on the same basis as awards of the High Court calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort, will achieve the objective intended in the original section and dispenses with the necessity to include it in the amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that there was little doubt that if it is a matter to be dealt with in the High Court, the personal injuries action in that court would proceed on a similar basis &ndash; that is to say that the court would take into account previous awards of compensation where the second infection has aggravated the loss and damage already <Col N="619" /> caused by the first. It would be only where the independent and different tortfeasors caused separate the distinct injuries that the courts would not have regard to the earlier awards. As the principles form a clearly established part of the existing law governing the award of damages in personal injuries, I consider that sections 5(3D)(<i>a</i>)(i) and 5(3D)(<i>b</i>)(i) are unnecessary. It is a matter for the tribunal and ultimately the High Court to determine the issues.</P>

It certainly accepted that the principle of the law of tort would still prevail, but it was concerned about the way this Bill was framed in terms of other previous payments. I welcome the fact that the Minister is proposing to change the Bill. I understand that the Irish Haemophilia Society accepts that this proposal improves the Bill.</P>

      <P>On section 8, the Minister undertook to send me a note about the fund. I think the same thing applies to section 7, which amends section 10 of the 1987 Act. In respect of the fund, I asked the Minister on Second Stage if he would send me a note on the matter. He said he would, but I have not received it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will send it. I will put the note on the record of the House. It might cover issues that Deputy McManus raised last evening as well. First, I will address the concerns raised by Deputy McManus in respect of the funding of compensation awards. I want to reassure the Deputies that funding for tribunal awards is provided for under the 1997 Act. This funding is ring-fenced in my Department's Vote each year. In compliance with section 10 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, a special account has been set up from which the tribunals awards are paid and its administrative costs are met.</P>
      <P>Subhead G2 of the health Vote encompasses payments to this special account in respect of the general awards and administrative costs of the tribunal, while subhead G3 provides for payments into the reparation fund established under section 11 of the 1997 Act.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, expenditure under these subheads is essentially demand-led. This expenditure is not discretionary. Awards of the tribunal and of the High Court on appeal or statutory entitlements must and will be paid.</P>

      <P>I am happy to let this Bill pass without dividing the House. I do not think making legislation in this way is proper constitutionally. I hope we have not given a hostage to fortune. I hope that, in the legislation we are passing, we are doing what we intend to do and that the Bill does not contain provisions that will give rise <Col N="622" /> to any doubt at a later date. We are heading into a general election and there will not be an opportunity to raise this matter in the House for some time so I hope the Bill addresses the concerns we raised.</P>
      <P>I record my appreciation of the work done by Transfusion Positive, Positive Action and the Irish Haemophilia Society. The latter has been very active in terms of keeping in touch and I admire the professionalism with which its members handled their task. If any of them have any free time, I have a constituency campaign to organise in Dublin South Central and I would welcome that sort of professionalism.</P>
      <P>This is a good day's work and it shows that participative and representative democracy can work hand in glove. I hope that what we have done here today goes a long way towards amending the wrongs that were done in the past and that it is the commencement of a new beginning for those who have suffered for too long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to support the passing of the Bill. The circumstances in which the Bill is to be enacted are so distressing and disturbing that there is consensus among all the parties that justice must be done for these unfortunate people. Since I entered politics I cannot think of any other set of experiences that have been so disturbing to me and to many others than listening to the testimony given to the Lindsay tribunal. I hope the lessons have been learned and that we can say that some good has come out of this terrible series of events that blighted so many people's lives and ended the lives of many others. I am glad the Minister has accepted that there was inherent discrimination in the Bill. The changes we have made now will ensure that there will not be discrimination among different groups, which is a good development.</P>
      <P>We all wanted to reach the point where we could deliver a fair compensation scheme to these people but this is not the way to bring legislation through the House. I am deeply uncomfortable about the fact that I have participated in bringing legislation through the House which was not carefully considered and on which I have not had time to reflect or get proper legal opinion. I compare this experience to the experience in relation to a shorter Bill to introduce a constitutional amendment on abortion which required, unnecessarily as it turned out, much energy and commitment from the Government to convince the people to change the Constitution. In this case we are trying to ensure that the needs of a vulnerable group of people who were literally poisoned by the State are met, yet we are unable to give this Bill the consideration it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will stand up and defend the Government's position, as all Ministers do, but it would be appropriate for him to admit that this is not best practice. We are always talking about best practice for others but let us talk about best practice for ourselves. It is not best practice to find amendments fluttering into our pigeon holes <Col N="623" /> five or ten minutes before we begin Committee Stage of a Bill. I am uncomfortable about that procedure and I hope that everything will turn out right on the night. In my experience there is no guarantee that even the most finely crafted legislation does not contain hidden flaws. In this case, not only is it not finely crafted but we have not had a chance to examine how well or otherwise the parliamentary counsel have done their work.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have participated in the passage of this Bill through the House but I am not at all happy with the way we have carried out that process, and I hope it does not happen again.</P>

As Deputies McManus and Mitchell said, all of us were affected by what transpired at that tribunal and by the testimony of those who gave evidence to it. There were complex legal issues surrounding that decision and the Bill, and we entered into discussion with the Irish Haemophilia Society in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents a substantial scheme in terms of compensation. It breaks new legal ground and, by its very nature, one can see the difficulties that arose in advance of it.

Once we got agreement on the scheme, we moved mountains to get the legislation published and passed through the House. I always said I would not impose a scheme on those involved and on the society in particular, that this was not a take it or leave it situation and that I would seek consensus on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Irish Haemophilia Society for its contribution to the scheme and to the discussions that took place. Its members have experience of the issues that people here or outside this House do not have, and that experience was very valuable. I also thank Transfusion Positive and Positive Action whose members contacted us yester<Col N="624" /> day and whom we met quickly following that contact. They identified their concerns to us and we moved on those concerns with the agreement of the House.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the point that we would have liked more time but this is a substantial scheme by any standards which breaks significant new ground because of the unique set of circumstances that gave rise to the need for it and the amendment of the principal Act of 1997. In that context, I pay tribute to my officials in the Department of Health and Children who have worked consistently in recent weeks to get the Bill ready. I thank also the officials in the Attorney General's office who were very helpful and co-operative, particularly on the legal issues which required certain teasing out given that this legislation was breaking new ground.</P>
    <P>I thank the Opposition spokespersons for their co-operation. I acknowledge and understand the difficulties they have had with the Bill but I am pleased that they facilitated its passage through the House.</P>

    <Title>Communications Regulation Bill, 2002  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I apologise that my officials have not arrived yet with the scripts but we thought this debate was to begin at 3.15 p.m. I am very pleased to be able to introduce the Communications Regulation Bill, 2002, to this House. I thank the Deputies, especially Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy O'Shea &ndash; I am sure he does not know either that we are debating this now &ndash; for accommodating this important legislation following its successful passage through the Seanad. The main purposes of the Bill are to create a commission for communications regulation, to dissolve the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and transfer its functions to the commission, to strengthen the powers available to ensure that regulatory decisions are complied with and to provide for the improved management of public road openings for the purpose of laying telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going into the details of the Bill, I will give some background to the reasons for its introduction. The regulation of the communications sector involves a number of important tasks. A key role is to facilitate competition among operators but in a way that protects the public interest generally and also the interests of individual consumers. Another key role is to ensure that obligations imposed on operators in the public interest, such as universal service obligations, are complied with and that quality of service is assured. A further task is to manage and facilitate effective use of scarce and valuable resources, <Col N="625" /> particularly the radio frequency spectrum. These tasks are important, not only because of the benefits they bring to consumers of communications services but also because of the wider importance of the communications sector to economic and social development as a whole. The communications sector has a major role in achieving the economic and social benefits that the information society will bring.</P>
    <P>The electronic communications sector has been experiencing a period of unprecedented change. During the 1990s, developments in technology, the Internet and telecommunications services, together with market liberalisation, enhanced the importance of the sector for economic and social development. The realisation that the sector was an indispensable building block for the development of the information society meant that it became an issue of public policy as well as a commercial opportunity. We have seen substantial investment in the sector. More recently we have seen a downturn in this investment and confidence in the commercial health of the sector has been severely dented. Despite this, realising the vision of the information society is a goal that we must pursue in the economic and social interests of the State.</P>
    <P>The electronic communications sector remains an important building block for the development of the information society. We need a communications sector which provides competitively-priced products and services to all consumers. This should be done in a way that enables the operators to obtain a reasonable return on their investment so that they can continue to invest in the sector. They must continue to find new ways of meeting the needs of consumers in a cost effective way. I referred earlier to the role regulation plays in facilitating competition. Where there is effective competition among operators the sector will become stronger. This means that a number of operators will be competing against each other to win customers and meet their needs and that customers will be able to switch from one operator to another when they find a lower price available or better quality on offer.</P>
    <P>The regulatory framework has an important role to play in making this happen. For example, operators need to have low barriers to entry to the market. They need the ability to get the facilities they need at wholesale level and at a reasonable price to offer services at retail level. However, the reality can be different. It is a feature of the electronic communications sector that operators need to obtain facilities from their major competitor to compete against that competitor. It is from that area that many of the ongoing rows, charges and counter-charges, cases and legal arguments spring.</P>
    <P>There is a natural tendency for the major competitor to protect its own competitive position. One of the key roles for regulation of the electronic communications sector is to ensure fair competition among the operators in these circumstances. One can understand how this rivalry <Col N="626" /> could come about &ndash; the main player in the market has seen its infrastructure build up over the years and it can find it difficult, despite European directives and instruments, to share in a competitive way with other people who wish to use that infrastructure so that, in turn, customers can get a better deal.</P>
    <P>Why do we still need such regulation over three years after the full liberalisation of the sector? There are still such substantial differences in market power between operators that competition could be inhibited if there were no regulatory framework in place. Some operators continue to be in a dominant market position. Abuse of that dominant position needs to be prevented. While competition law and the powers of the Competition Authority are there to address abuses of a dominant market position, these powers are normally only invoked after there has been a claim or evidence of an abuse. The regulatory framework that we have for the electronic communications sector complements competition law by preventing abuse from happening in the first place. This is a valuable tool in a sector such as communications where time is important. We all want to see the benefits of competition and the development of vibrant information society services sooner rather than later, and prevention rather than cure is the way to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Another reason we still need specific regulation of the communications sector is to protect the interests of users. We have moved relatively quickly from a monopoly to full liberalisation and competition. In the monopoly era the counterpart to the exclusive privilege of providing telecommunications services was the obligation to meet the reasonable needs of all users in the country, wherever located, at an affordable price. A concern that may be expressed is that new operators may take customers from the former monopoly operator in low cost areas, leaving the former monopoly operator to supply customers in the high cost areas. A related concern is that in trying to address these threats the former monopoly operator could raise prices charged to vulnerable consumers who would not be able to find an alternative supplier at a lower price. However, it is the function of the regulatory framework to protect consumer interests in this area and this role continues, notwithstanding privatisation and liberalisation, and will continue.</P>
    <P>The task of regulating the communications sector currently lies with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. This post was created under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996. The functions of regulating the telecommunications sector and broadcasting transmission systems and managing the radio frequency spectrum were assigned to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Etain Doyle, and her office with effect from 30 June 1997. She has been there as long as I have been Minister and she may be there longer, depending on what the electorate says. The functions of the office now encompass three areas: regulation of the <Col N="627" /> electronic communications sector, encompassing both telecommunications and broadcasting transmission systems; regulation of the postal sector; and management of the radio frequency spectrum. The nature of these tasks is changing and they are in many respects becoming more complex.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that the past five years in which the director and her office have been carrying out her functions have not been challenging. I pay tribute to the director and her staff for their achievements in meeting the various challenges they have encountered over that period. Among the challenges they have faced were the need to put in place all the necessary measures to enable the successful implementation of the full liberalisation of the telecommunications sector from 1 December 1998, following my decision to bring forward the ending of the derogation on full liberalisation from 1 January 2000 to 1 December 1998. Among the necessary measures were a licensing framework for new operators and establishment of the rights and obligations governing interconnection between Eircom's telecommunications network and the facilities of other operators.</P>
    <P>In addition, the director established new licensing frameworks governing the transmission of television programmes by cable, MMDS and deflector systems and, in September 2000, took over functions in relation to the postal sector, in particular the supervision of the universal service obligation of An Post, including quality of service and tariffs.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the reasons we are proposing changes to structure for the regulation of the communications sector. With a number of regulatory bodies having been established to oversee activity in the energy, aviation transport and telecommunications sectors, I initiated a public consultation process on the governance and accountability of these bodies. In the main, that arose on foot of the many debates we had, when the select committee dealt with the Estimates each year, about the fact that there appeared to be a lack of accountability in the operations of Etain Doyle's office. This was not of Ms Doyle's doing. It arose by virtue of the fact that under the 1996 Act she was not obliged to act in an accountable manner. Members will recall that there was somewhat of a fracas at the time and she very nobly agreed &ndash; she was under no obligation to do so &ndash; to appear before the relevant committee. Since then proper reporting mechanisms have been in place.</P>
    <P>There was also frequent informal debates about how we shifted from a position where the Minister was responsible &ndash; the Dáil has ultimate responsibility &ndash; to one where the powers were transferred to the regulator. We wondered if we were replacing a democratic process with a non-elective way of doing things where no one would have responsibility. The debate on this matter was always interesting and, having discussed it with my colleagues in Europe, I do not believe <Col N="628" /> that any country has resolved it in a completely harmonious fashion. It would probably not be possible to do so.</P>
    <P>The one thing of which I was sure on entering office was that the independence of the regulator would need to be protected. There could, therefore, be no stepping over the line. I was determined that this would be the case in all three areas: communications, energy and aviation. I do not believe in interfering in the work of regulators and I have not done so. If I may say so, with a little immodesty, it is somewhat of a credit to me and to our democratic system that we have quickly got to grips with the regulatory system. However, there is a need to shape that system to ensure the duties and rights of the Oireachtas and those of the regulator are clearly laid down.</P>
    <P>The consultation process to which I referred earlier resulted in the publication of a policy paper in March 2000 entitled Governance and Accountability in the Regulatory Process: Policy Proposals. The paper, which is in line with the Government's commitment to regulatory reform, contains policy proposals forming the basis of my policy on the regulatory framework for the economic sectors coming within my ambit. Among the issues which I considered, taking into account the comments received in the public consultation, are the composition of regulatory authorities, the terms and conditions governing their appointment, their period of office, decision-making processes and financial and functional accountability of regulatory authorities to the Oireachtas, the Minister and the public. The Bill provides for the implementation of proposals contained in the policy document to which I refer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the composition of regulatory authorities, I considered the relative merits and drawbacks of an individual regulator and regulatory board and decided that, as a general rule, a regulatory authority should comprise three members. As stated in the governance and accountability policy document, many of the decisions to be made by a regulatory authority are significant, both for those involved in the regulated industries and for the economy as a whole. This is particularly the case in relation to the communications sector where there has been a substantial growth in the regulatory workload, and the nature of the tasks and rulings which have to be implemented have become increasingly complex and qualitative. The existing legislative framework for telecommunications, which is based on European law, was primarily designed to manage the transition from monopoly to competition and was, therefore, focused on the creation of a competitive market and the rights of new entrants.</P>
    <P>The market is changing with ever-increasing speed in terms of market developments, in particular the convergence between telecommunications, broadcasting and IT sectors, evolution in technology and changes in user demand. The balancing of different interests, not only among industry players and between the industry and <Col N="629" /> consumers but also between the short-term and long-term economic and social interests of the State, often requires that difficult judgment calls have to be made. A three-person commission would be in a better position to bear the burden of making such decisions than an individual. This is no reflection on the excellent and most competent performance of Etain Doyle as director. I again acknowledge her achievements in the post and I welcome the fact that the Bill will enable her to complete her second term of office, bringing the benefit of her experience to the commission.</P>
    <P>In respect of accountability, the transfer of regulatory functions from Ministers to independent statutory bodies requires that there be clear accountability mechanisms, without compromising, in any way, their functional independence. In relation to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, a number of provisions to ensure appropriate accountability are in place, either in the existing legislation or through practice. However, the Bill proposes to formally put in place appropriate accountability mechanisms without, as I have said, compromising the functional independence of the commission.</P>
    <P>Apart from reforming the organisational structure for the regulation of communications, the Bill provides for the reform of the framework governing access to public roads for the construction of telecommunications networks. The growth of the electronic communications sector in recent years is one of the great success stories of the economy. However, if there has been a downside it has been that the laying of new electronic communications infrastructure has required an unprecedented volume of road openings. Everyone is familiar with this problem, which has put an added strain on traffic in towns and cities. The Bill seeks to ensure that there will be minimum disruption to the public and the environment in the build-out of electronic communications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, local authorities will be given increased powers to co-ordinate and control road openings by telecommunications companies. The new commission will be able to bring about agreements on the sharing of electronic communications infrastructure and impose conditions on sharing agreements. The sharing of electronic communications infrastructure will reduce the need for companies to continually open roads and lay their networks, and make it easier for both new and existing companies to install such infrastructure. This will I hope speed up the delivery of state-of-the-art electronic communications services which are essential for the development of the information society.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill will create a sound economic and regulatory framework within which the commission will work. In framing the legislation and in line with the requirements for introducing new statutory measures, my Department carried out public consultation on the proposals and has had substantial <Col N="630" /> discussions, meetings and seminars with relevant Departments, interested parties and the public.</P>
    <P>The Bill is separated into five main parts. Part 1 contains standard provisions covering the Short Title, interpretations, the laying of orders and regulations before both Houses etc. Part 2 deals with the establishment of the commission for communications regulation. Part 3 details the enforcement provisions applicable to the new commission. Part 4 deals with transitional provisions arising from the transformation of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation into the commission. Part 5 deals with road works.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the commission in carrying out its functions are set out in section 12. This is a new provision, setting out in legislation the key principles to guide the commission in its activities.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is another important provision, enabling the Minister to issue policy directions to the commission. This provision extends the scope of an existing power in the 1996 Act in relation to the radio frequency spectrum to enable policy directions to be issued also in relation to the electronic communications sector and the postal sector. In order not to compromise the functional independence of the commission, this power to issue directions is limited to issues of policy and must not relate to individual undertakings or persons. The section specifies that a direction may relate to the methods by which licences to use the radio frequency spectrum may be allocated. In addition, the Minister must publish the proposed direction not less than three weeks in advance of its issue and consider representations received.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 to 30 provide for the resources and revenues of the commission. The Minister may make advances to the commission and the commission may also borrow money subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance. The main provision in relation to funding is the commission's power to impose a levy on the regulated entities, namely, electronic communications providers and providers of postal services. A new provision enables early refund to the Exchequer of surplus income where, for example, highly valuable licences have been awarded.</P>
    <P>Part 3, sections 40 to 47, inclusive, deals with the enforcement powers of the new commission. The Bill contains two provisions in particular, which will substantially enhance the enforcement of regulatory decisions compared with the current position. One of these new provisions is based on provisions contained in the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001, and provides for the imposition of a fine of &euro;1,000 in cases where the commission has reasonable ground for believing that a person has committed an offence under the provisions of a European directive. Where the person fails to pay the fine, the commission may proceed with prosecuting the offence in the courts where, I presume, the fines will be much greater.</P>
    <P>The other new enforcement measure is section 46 which provides for prosecution on indictment <Col N="631" /> for breaches of licence conditions, with a maximum fine of &euro;4 million or 10% of the operator's turnover, whichever is the greater. This represents a substantial increase in the maximum penalty for a breach of a licence condition, which currently amounts to &euro;1,900.</P>
    <P>I am confident these provisions, which have given rise to vocal complaints, represent a significantly enhanced enforcement mechanism which will enable the new commission to enforce its regulatory decisions in today's rapidly evolving communications sector.</P>
    <P>Part 5, sections 53 to 61, inclusive, provide for the reform of the legislative framework governing the opening of public roads by telecommunications operators. In particular, section 54 provides that operators will be required to obtain the consent of local authorities which are responsible for roads in their areas, before opening public roads to lay telecommunications networks. I am satisfied the Bill will seek to ensure that road authorities will be able to properly control access to public highways by telecommunications operators, without unduly inhibiting the installation of telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage greater sharing of facilities among operators and thereby avoid unnecessary disruption, section 58 enables the new commission to bring about agreements on the sharing of electronic communications infrastructure and to impose conditions in sharing agreements. Currently, the director may only intervene in sharing negotiations at the request of one of the parties. The Bill now enables network operators to inform the commission of any negotiations on infrastructure they enter into and empowers the commission to intervene if agreement is not reached.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the communications sector is an important contributor to our objective of being at the vanguard of the information society and electronic commerce. In order to ensure we have an efficient and effective communications sector we need to have a regulatory framework for the sector which will maximise effective competition in the shortest possible timeframe. The Bill will set out a clear accountability framework for the new body in relation to Government, the Oireachtas, industry and the public. The framework for consents by road authorities set out in the Bill should provide for clarity and fairness as well as a consistent approach.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said to Deputy O'Shea just before entering the Chamber. I am sure we will have a robust debate when we come to Committee Stage. It has not been my approach to curtail the debating time allocated to Bills, particularly with regard to the preparation and discussion of amendments. I am very conscious that, in the best interests of ensuring that this very necessary reform is passed, the Labour and Fine Gael Parties have made spokespersons available when the rest of the Chamber appears to be out on the <Col N="632" /> highways and byways and I thank the Deputies present.</P>

        <b>: </b>I have been pressing for the publication of the Communications Regulation Bill for a considerable period. I regret that the publication of the Bill, which is extremely important legislation, has been delayed until the dying days of this Administration. While I appreciate the Minister's statement, I reiterate the comments I made on the Order of Business that a Bill of this importance deserves far more deliberation than we can give it in this House and that it is wrong that we are expected to take Second Stage, Committee Stage, Report Stage and Fifth Stage in just a few hours.</P>
      <P>Initially, when the schedule for this week was drafted, the Bill was to be debated all day because other people wished to contribute on it. However, as the Minister said, they are now tramping the high roads and by-roads on a different mission aimed at getting re-elected to the House in four or five weeks' time.</P>
      <P>The heads of the Bill should have been published and the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport should have held hearings with the various interest groups involved in the communications industry in order to enable them to make observations and present a critical analysis regarding what the legislation should contain. The final draft of the Bill would then be better from the point of view of informed input by the various sectors of the communications industry and other interested parties, including consumer interests.</P>

        <b>: </b>The Minister stated there was a public consultation process. I am not aware of how public, intensive or expansive that process was, but my fax is clogged with e-mails from various smaller interested parties who feel they were not consulted.</P>
      <P>The Bill attempts to do three things, namely, create a commission for communications regulation, increase penalties for breach of certain offences and provide for the improved management of public road openings for the purpose of laying telecommunications infrastructure. This is not an earth shattering agenda and one could argue that the Minister has missed or is avoiding the opportunity to legislate on other issues of more immediate interest to the telecommunications sector. The Government is legislating to increase bureaucracy and make it more difficult for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to get on with its job. The ODTR will get little new real power under this Bill other than minor changes in relation to enforcement. Instead of facilitating speedy decisions, the proposed new compliance rules are meek and meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" />The Government appears to have forgotten that European Union telecommunications Ministers have reached agreement on a new package of measures which will increase competition further. With Ireland ranked a poor 27th of 30 developed countries on key types of broadband access, there is nothing in this legislation to facilitate extending broadband throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have tabled amendments on many issues in order to strengthen the Bill. I am tempted to call on the Government to consider withdrawing it because it needs to be comprehensively reviewed. As I said previously, all the players involved in the telecommunications and postal services sector should have their views listened to and not ignored by the Minister and her Department. The Government preaches the merits of an inclusive approach but fails to put these principles into practice when important legislation is mooted.</P>
    <P>In considering my comments, I ask the Minister to bear in mind the Government's recent consultation document, Towards Better Regulation. If our civil servants applied the principles and practices in this legislation, the Bill would never have made it to the Oireachtas in its present form. For example, the OECD noted in its report, Regulatory Reform In Ireland, that the justification for detailed sectoral regulatory intervention might diminish over time. Towards Better Regulation raises critical questions on page 52 about the ODTR and other regulators, for example, it is argued that strategic policy decisions need to be taken about handling customer complaints in regulated industries, about the accountability of regulators to the Oireachtas and about providing additional powers to the regulators. Why then is the Government championing the cause of better regulation, while the Minister for Public Enterprise is pressing ahead with a Bill obviously oblivious to the good counsel of the OECD which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have publicly supported?</P>

        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>If the Minister supports Government policy, as she says she does, why has a regulatory impact analysis not been prepared on the Bill? If a regulatory analysis was carried out on the Bill, it would probably score two out of ten. Again referring to OECD best practice, we would have had a statement of the views of all interested parties to hand and the response of the Department to their representations. The Minister would have had to table a paper on the alternatives to the detailed prescriptive provisions in the Bill. We would also expect to have a report on how the legislation will be enforced and what problems may be anticipated in achieving compliance. If an RIA was prepared, we would also know the cost of implementing the legislation and the additional resources required by the Department, the DPP and the ODTR. Can the Minister <Col N="634" /> set out the cost compliance burden of the legislation?</P>
      <P>The OECD correctly identified weaknesses in Ireland's capacity to produce high quality legislation. The Government's report notes that these weaknesses include the fact that there is still a command and control attitude in relation to regulating behaviour. The Bill is clear evidence of bad legislation which defies the basic principles of better regulation allegedly supported by the Government. I would like the Minister to explain to the House how her Bill co-exists with Government policy and the OECD's recommendations for better regulation. I would have thought the Minister would have introduced amendments on Committee Stage and would have carried out radical surgery on the Bill. The Bill needs accident and emergency attention and it should not be left on the Government trolley. What is needed is a revitalised and relevant Bill, not one which is jaundiced and overly reliant on prescriptive medicine.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad the Minister attached much emphasis to policy directives. She alluded to them again today. As the entire Government strategy on telecommunications and postal liberalisation derives from EU directives, can the Minister clarify what additional policy directives she has in mind? Unless the Minister can clarify her intentions, operators might be forgiven for assuming she will take decisions in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.</P>
      <P>The operators would be forgiven if they thought the Bill encouraged them to influence the ODTR by persuading the sponsoring Minister to issue appropriate guidance. Instead of facilitating market certainty the Bill seeks to provide a parallel regulatory regime which all concerned will no doubt seek to influence and circumvent. I am also puzzled by the fact the Minister can, in addition to the power to issue policy directives, block radio spectrum regulations made by the ODTR. Why is it necessary to have both the authority to consent to these regulations and to give policy directives on the same subject? If the Minister's aim is to speed up the making of licence schemes, she is doing the exact opposite. The Minister's successor in the Department should be encouraged to read &ldquo;The Better Regulation Report&rdquo; before policy directives are issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to probe the Minister regarding her views on the draft EU directive which will further liberalise the internal market for postal services. How will this directive impact on An Post and what are the implications of the directive for the ODTR? The Bill needs to be amended in order that the objectives of the ODTR can be expanded. I propose an amendment to that effect in section 12 to promote competition in the postal sector. In the Seanad the Minister relied on the argument that An Post is responsible for the efficient running of the postal service. However, the track record of public utilities is not good in terms of efficiency. It is a key regulatory function to promote efficiency so that <Col N="635" /> the public gets good services on time and at reasonable prices. The ODTR, for example, caused Eircom to sharpen its act on a range of issues. The public expects the same for An Post. We should remember that utility costs are input costs for all other businesses. It is critical for the well being of the economy and for jobs that utilities are run as efficiently as possible. The issue for the Government is whether the ODTR will have the same significant influence on the postal sector as it has on the telecommunications sector.</P>
    <P>While the legislation has some potential to provide the ODTR with the necessary legal powers of enforcement to protect the rights of consumers and to provide the regulatory backdrop against which openness, accountability and competition can prevail within the telecommunications market, one of the main aspects of the Bill which undoubtedly causes concern is enforcement &ndash; in other words, the powers of the regulator to force the telecommunications operators to comply with the terms and conditions of their licence. Earlier versions of the Bill attempted to give the regulator some additional powers to compel companies to obey their licence obligations, which was a specific recommendation of the OECD in a report on Ireland published in April 2001. However, these powers have been considerably reduced in the Bill and unfortunately as a result only limited changes are made to the present regime. The Bill still relies on the ultimate threat of criminal enforcement. The ODTR can take cases and the maximum fine is enshrined in the Bill. More serious prosecutions can only be taken by the DPP. However, the DPP has indicated that the office has limited resources to take on a prosecution on behalf of the regulator. That means we face a real and imminent problem.</P>
    <P>Limited resources have also been the experience of the Competition Authority. As a result, whether the maximum fine is defined as 10% of turnover, as in earlier drafts of the Bill, or the new fine in the Bill which is calculated in some cases at less than 10% of turnover for an operator like Eircom, the possibility of a high fine being enforced remains theoretical. One of the biggest problems in dealing with the big service providers is that of intransigence, obfuscation and delay. How often have we seen Eircom thwart the directions of the regulator by refusing point blank to accept her decisions and challenging her rulings in the courts? Because of delays in the preparation of cases, defending cases and the courts backlog, the challenge to the ODTR is not heard for several months. The result is that the <i>status quo</i> remains.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what will happen with this Bill. It will still take months to prepare a case and a further considerable period of time to get the case before the courts for a definitive judgment. When one considers the additional time that will elapse before an appeal, it is obvious that the powers vested by the legislation are inadequate. There is also the possibility that it will be open to the culp<Col N="636" /> able delaying operator to comply before the case reaches court. It would be better if the regulator was in a position to put the effort required by the court case into pursuing operators on an inch by inch basis, thereby achieving the same result in a faster time. The only other enforcement provision is the power to bring an operator before the court to comply with its licence. Unfortunately, that adds little to the regulator's current powers and, given the delays in litigation, it is not a practical solution to urgent issues.</P>
    <P>This Bill pales into insignificance when one considers the situation in other countries. Those countries allow the regulator to impose fines, but there is no similar provision in this Bill. I understand that one of the reasons advanced for the failure to vest the power to impose fines in the regulator is because of possible constitutional doubts about the role of administrative bodies. However, there is a considerable body of legal opinion which states that there is no constitutional impediment to giving the regulator the power to fine, as this is required under EU law. I understand this legal advice was actually provided to the Minister's Department by the Telecommunications Users' Group last July. Other administrative bodies are allowed to request a payment as a condition for not proceeding with a prosecution.</P>
    <P>This particular power is granted to bodies including the Director of Company Enforcement by section 109 of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001. These are very clear precedents which should enable the ODTR to impose fines. One must therefore ask what is the legal difficulty in vesting such a power in the regulator and why, therefore, it has been omitted from the Bill currently before the House.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the issue of judicial review. The paper on governance and accountability in the regulatory process published by the Department of Public Enterprise recommends that cases against the regulator be taken by means of judicial review. The Supreme Court judgment in the Orange case also supports the approach of using judicial review in the context of specialist regulatory bodies. If this option were chosen, given the inevitable delay in bringing proceedings before the courts, it would put in place a relatively quick and well defined process which should apply to the ODTR in the measure we are now debating.</P>
    <P>The Competition Bill, 2001, clause 23(4), shifts the burden of proof from the Competition Authority. Similar provisions such as these should have been enshrined in this Bill to give considerably more certainty to the regulator and to other parties so that important decisions relating to the awarding of licences could not be held up by frivolous, vexatious or tactical litigation. I am at a loss to know why it should be easier to sue the Office of the Regulator than to challenge bodies such as An Bord Pleanála or the Competition Authority. I would like the Minister to address this particular issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" />One imperative should be that the Communications Regulation Bill should clearly and categorically state that decisions of the regulator should stand until the court decides otherwise. While this provision does apply to some decisions such as those about licences, it does not apply to all issues. This is a further defect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be entirely negative. The telecommunications industry has waited almost six years for this new legislation. There is certainly a need for greater transparency in our regulatory structure and the policy directions which guide regulatory implementation. The legislation is needed to pave the way for the transposition of the new electronic communications directives which were adopted by the European Council of Ministers just last month. I welcome, in particular, the establishment of a three-person commission. This is a more sensible structure to deal with diverse markets and regulatory issues in this sector and it removes the burden of responsibility from one individual.</P>
    <P>Regarding infrastructure, the situation for operators regarding road openings is further clarified. However, the objective of ensuring technological neutrality has been removed from the final version of the Bill and I ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to outline the reason for such a removal. Surely, it is a fundamental objective of regulation in an era of convergence to ensure a level playing field. The EU package of electronic communications directives also reflects this approach.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the issue of charges and the high cost of Internet access in this country. Consumers, both commercial and domestic, are at a huge disadvantage from the point of view of Internet access by comparison with their counterparts throughout the rest of the world. When it comes to Internet access, Ireland is the only country of which I am aware where access charges are levied by way of charges per minute. All other countries operate a flat rate monthly charge with unlimited access. The following costs for Internet access in other European countries put starkly into perspective just how disadvantaged consumers are in this country. The flat rate for the UK is &euro;21 per month; in Spain it is &euro;17 per month; in France it is &euro;15 for 50 hours; in the Netherlands it is &euro;119 per month on an ISDN line; and in Portugal it is &euro;29 per month.</P>
    <P>The Internet access charge per minute operated in this country is hugely prohibitive. The Minister and her Department have failed to prevail on Internet providers to introduce the same flat rate monthly charge that operates in every other jurisdiction. One must be fair to Esat which some time ago introduced a flat rate &ldquo;Esat Surf No Limit&rdquo; scheme, but the company had to abandon it because it had to pay Eircom for the service on a per minute basis. It was quite obvious that it was not viable in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister's recent announcement in relation to the roll-out of broadband on a three-tier basis is welcome. However, because of the <Col N="638" /> per minute charge and the failure to introduce a monthly flat rate charge it will be of very limited value to either domestic or small business customers. Broadband will be significantly faster from the point of view of downloading than the current downloading by ISDN. There is no broadband in this country at present except Eircom market broadband, but what Eircom is providing is ISDN which is only 130% faster than a home line. As a result, people will not surf the Internet because they simply cannot wait for up to 30 minutes to download at a rate of 15p per three minutes.</P>
    <P>If one is setting up a business, for example, it costs approximately &euro;3,000 to run an Internet advertisement. However, if one does not have a catchment of users staying on-line, one's business simply will not get going and one will not have a catchment of interested customers if the per minute charge remains in place. Therefore, business is at a huge disadvantage, small businesses are being stifled and huge opportunities are being lost to create new jobs. The cost to business of availing of broadband will be approximately &euro;2,000 per month. How can any small business afford to pay &euro;24,000 per annum just to avail of broadband?</P>
    <P>Essentially, the Minister's proposal will be of significant advantage to large businesses but of little benefit to small businesses, the establishment of new small businesses and domestic consumers. The reason that fast downloading is so important is obvious. Websites and pages are getting larger and larger. Therefore, if we want to enable people to have more Internet access, they must be enabled to download quickly and not have to wait up to 30 minutes to find what they want on-screen.</P>
    <P>The plans outlined by the Minister are also found wanting in that they will not bring broadband to local exchanges. The result is that it will not get out to the small consumer, which should be the ultimate objective, because the ordinary telephone lines do not have to be upgraded. Essentially, there will be a direct feed into large companies. It is a pity the Department has not prevailed on Eircom to connect to local exchanges. This cannot now be done because Eircom has been fully privatised and is, therefore, beyond the control of the Minister and her Department. A way must be found to make these fibres available to small users. There is huge employment potential if broadband is available to the small business sector. This is vital in every way. It is vital from the point of view of sustaining population, providing high levels of education and enabling high earners to live in remote areas. If people in remote areas of the west have access to broadband they can then have direct communication links with any part of the world.</P>
    <P>I have an observation in relation to section 59 of the Bill which deals with the felling of trees. I have examined this section and there may be a constitutional issue in relation to the rights of private property owners. The ESB is a State util<Col N="639" /> ity and has powers to enter private land but Eircom is no longer in public ownership and I doubt if a private company has the right of access to private property as proposed in this Bill. The provisions in sections 59 and 60 could be subject to legal challenge and could well be deemed unconstitutional. We will be a lot wiser when these sections are tested in another forum.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm an seans a bheith agam labhairt sa díospóireacht ar an mBille tábhachtach seo, an Bille um Rialáil Cumarsáide, 2002. Tá sé ráite agam cheana go bhfuil mé toilteanach cabhrú leis an mBille seo a chur tríd an Dáil chomh tapaidh agus is féidir ach tá gnéithe áirithe den mBille ag déanamh buartha dom. Cuirfidh mé an bhuairt sin os comhair an Aire le linn na díospóireachta.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important Bill. I am favourably disposed to facilitating its early passage. Nonetheless, there are aspects to the Bill which concern me and I ask the Minister to respond to these concerns.</P>
      <P>The final objective of regulation is to provide fair and open competition so that the consumer can avail of the optimum range of services at the most competitive prices. The Minister's proposed amendment to delete section 35 appears to be at variance with the fundamentals of regulation. Section 35 deals with co-operation between the Commission for Communications Regulation and the Competition Authority. The section deals with three main areas. The Commission for Communications Regulation and the Competition Authority may, where either body considers it appropriate, defer to the other body in respect of consideration of any matter which is regulated by both the commission and the Competition Authority.</P>
      <P>The Commission for Communications Regulation and the Competition Authority shall consult with the other body before taking any decision or action in relation to the communication network operations or any category thereof which may reasonably be regarded as involving action which the other body may also be entitled to take and shall take account of any opinion expressed by the other body on the matter. The Commission for Communications Regulation and the Competition Authority may share in confidence any information received by one of them from the other body for the purposes of this section and the other body shall, subject to any requirement of law, protect the confidentiality of that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Forfás report entitled Broadband Investment in Ireland &ndash; Review of Progress and Key Policy Requirement states in its summary of key policy requirements that creating regulatory certainty is the key to attracting the required broadband investment from operators. It states that the passage of the Communications Regulation Bill in early 2002 is critical to this and should be <Col N="640" /> amended to clarify the relationship between the proposed commission and the Competition Authority. It seems incredible that the Minister inserted such a section and now proposes to take it out, albeit that section 35 is still woolly and lacks clarity in regard to this vital relationship. Surely regulatory certainty requires more than one body deferring to the other when any matter is regulated by both? One body should consult with the other before taking any decision or action in relation to communications network operators or any category thereof which may reasonably be regarded as involving action which the other body may also be entitled to take and shall take account of any opinion expressed by the other body on the matter. This provision is not categorical and would lead to confusion.</P>
    <P>The matter of sharing confidential information seems in this era of transparency and accountability to be a rather dubious proposal. While I understand that the section is to be deleted in favour of the provisions of the recent Competition Bill, does the Minister propose to leave this vital area unresolved with the undoubted adverse consequences to very necessary investment by broadband investors? </P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's assurances on this issue. This question is not just in relation to the commission and the Competition Authority, it can also arise in the area of broadcasting. The issue of where the responsibilities and rights of the Competition Authority end and the responsibilities and rights of the other body begin requires clarification. I find it extraordinary that this is being deleted from the Bill&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the Competition Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I believe that neither solution is the best one for the areas which exist on the margins and where there could be real conflict as to which agency is responsible.</P>
      <P>The second issue raised in the Forfás report is the matter of creating regulatory certainty and increased fines for non-compliance or breach of licence conditions. It is very necessary that the regime of increased fines is such that will enable fines to be imposed quickly so that any competitive advantage to the perpetrator can be removed. Under the provisions of this Bill a summary offence under this Act, other than under section 54(2) which deals with the opening of public roads for the establishment of underground electronic communications infrastructure, may be prosecuted by the proposed Commission for Communications Regulation. It is my understanding that an offence on indictment must be referred to the DPP and the DPP has indicated that the office has very limited resources to take a prosecution on behalf of the regulator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand this has also been the experience of the Competition Authority. Where the prosecution of an offence on indictment may not be <Col N="641" /> dealt with for years, this is justice denied to compliant operators and, ultimately, consumers. It can result in compliant operators going to the wall, thereby contributing to excessively dominant positions in the marketplace. Has the Minister any proposals to ensure the prosecution of offences on indictment under the provisions of the Bill, when passed, can be expedited? If there are no such proposals, there is a huge deficit in regard to regulation certainty, which is so necessary to attract much needed investment.</P>
    <P>One of today's newspapers reported that the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has drawn attention to this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the issue in order that I can be clear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>An offence on indictment has to be referred to the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true in regard to any Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we are dealing with a specific issue and justice can be denied to compliant operators if there is a long delay. I have been given information suggesting some files referred by the Competition Authority to the DPP's office can remain there for three or four years. I am concerned that it will take a long time before large operators come to court and fines are imposed. Their competitive advantage due to non-compliance would be a very serious factor to smaller compliant operators. There needs to be a mechanism whereby offences on indictment can be dealt with more rapidly. This legislation will be useless if there are long delays before cases get to court.</P>
      <P>The third key element to regulation certainty according to the Forfás report is to empower the regulator to introduce a flat rate interconnection package to enable competitive flat rate Internet access. This issue is probably the most central from the consumer's point of view. The case of carers or persons with a disability in the home has been presented to me. The people concerned are tied to the home in many cases and consequently represent a group which can benefit greatly from spending much time on-line.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom being on-line all the time can cost some &euro;40 per month on a fixed charge. In this country a person wishing to be on-line all the time would need to pay in the region of &euro;750. Obviously, this is intolerable in terms of the equal access of European citizens to be on-line all the time. This differential of 49 to one in the cost of being on-line all the time affects not only carers and persons with a disability, but also has to be an enormous factor in discouraging those who have yet to avail of Internet access. It contributes hugely to something that should be avoided at all costs, that is, the development of a division in society between the information rich and the information poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" />I quote from the Government's newly launched information society action plan: &ldquo;inclusion to ensure that our development as an information society is inclusive and builds on the potential of ICTs to address issues of disadvantage and inclusion&rdquo;. By failing to provide for flat rate access to the Internet the Minister is, in effect, opting for a policy of non-inclusion. Deputy Higgins has tabled an amendment on Committee Stage in this regard and I have tabled one on Report Stage. The hopes and aspirations of all those who look to the day when competition in the Irish market will encourage telecoms operators to offer a flat rate service are not matched by the failure of the Minister to provide additional powers for the regulator to mandate operators to offer flat rate services. The Minister is flying in the face of the urgings of the State's own industrial policy agency, Forfás.</P>
    <P>Competition is now quickly dropping away at the consumer and micro business end of the market. Last week BT announced it was planning to pull its Irish subsidiary, Esat, out of the consumer and small business markets. The question arises as to who will drive competition in order that Eircom will make flat rate offerings when Esat has left the marketplace. The Minister should consider the consequences of her action in this central and vital area for carers, the disabled in the home, those seeking second chance education on-line and many others. This is the continuation of a policy of exclusion rather than inclusion regarding the information society.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quoted as saying the ODTR needed to be expanded because of the huge burden of work. I do not doubt that this is the case, but have some observations. Why has the Minister opted for the dissolution of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation? This office could have been expanded by supplying additional staff as necessary. Does it necessarily follow that three commissioners will operate more efficiently or effectively than one Director of Telecommunications Regulation? Either a director or three commissioners will delegate tasks but retain overall responsibility for carrying out statutory functions. Is there not an inherent danger that a group of three may prove to be more indecisive than one person in overall control? I favour the slimmer model at executive level. In spite what the Minister said, on what basis does she justify her confidence in the commissioner model?</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about convergence. The idea of convergence was more prevalent a few years ago, but has since receded somewhat. This refers to the convergence of broadband, the Internet and telephony. People talked about having one instrument that would serve as television set and telephone as well as providing Internet access. This brings me back to a problem similar to the lines of demarcation between the proposed Commission on Communications Regulation and the Competition Authority. Some of the responsibility for convergence rests with the <Col N="643" /> Department of Public Enterprise, which has been delegated to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. However, responsibility for broadcasting rests with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. We will not have a one-stop-shop approach to convergence.</P>
    <P>Through the new commission, the Minister for Public Enterprise is moving ahead to deal with two aspects of convergence, the Internet and telephony. However, responsibility for the broadcasting aspect rests elsewhere. This is not effective or efficient. This is an issue to which both Ministers should address themselves to come up with a complete package. Responsibility for convergence should rest in one place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill regarding road openings. However, there are problems that cannot be dealt with by one Department. For instance, roads are opened up for the provision of gas supplies, electricity, water, sewerage and cable television, but an overall authority is required to deal with this problem comprehensively and in a co-ordinated way. In new housing estates, one duct should be provided through which a variety of cables can be inserted. While the present situation is unsatisfactory, a step forward has been taken by placing responsibility on telecommunications companies to seek the consent of local authorities. I compliment the Minister on that move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I understand that other utilities will be using the legislation as a framework for their contacts with local authorities. I fully agree with the Deputy that this is the most bothersome part of providing new utilities. My Department, together with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, is laying out the provision of a single duct system. There has been agreement on that so it would not require legislation. It is a matter of consolidation. I apologise for interrupting but it was for information purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information and I am glad to see that progress is being made on that important issue. Another issue that has gone off the boil is that of third generation licences. It seems that the various telecommunications operators do not have the same enthusiasm for such licences as they did a couple of years ago. I am not sure where that matter stands at present and perhaps the Minister will provide us with some information when she replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister previously published a Bill concerning shared infrastructure but the legislation was withdrawn. She is approaching the subject here in a somewhat different manner. I am not satisfied with what is contained in the Bill because while there will be consultations between both companies, the commission may intervene if agreement is not reached. Intervention is all very well but it does not allow for direction to be given <Col N="644" /> by the commission and there is no indication that the commission may arbitrate. Consultation has not resulted in much happening during the time it has gone on. There is a need to strengthen this provision.</P>
    <P>We all come across cases in our constituencies where, for instance, an application may be made for a new mast. The argument may be made that if such facilities were shared there would be no need for a second mast. There is an indisputable case, in terms of prudence and good sense, for one mast to be shared by two operators. If the operator who owns the mast is being obstructive and unhelpful to a properly licensed operator who has a valid case for extending the service, there should be some means of concluding the matter. It is an area of great aggravation, not alone for telecommunications companies but also for the public. I would like to see something more definite included in the Bill concerning this point, if it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>The postal service and the radio network are among the areas that now rest within the ambit of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. I wish to begin with the telephony sector. When the office of the ODTR was established, the State was still an operator in the telecommunications sector, but privatisation took place under the Minister's stewardship. The State is neither an operator nor a regulator in that area now. Given the strategic importance of the telecommunications network, not just economically but also socially, is there not a case for keeping that part of the regulation within the State framework? The State is no longer an operator so there is no conflict of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I see the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of this important area should be more answerable to the Oireachtas than will be the case under the provisions of the Bill when enacted. That point struck me as the debate continued and I would like to hear the Minister's observations on it when she sums up.</P>
      <P>The postal sector was drawn to my attention by one of my colleagues, Deputy Stagg, who tabled a parliamentary question on the licensing of couriers to ensure the safety of their mail. I was surprised by the Minister's reply which effectively said that this type of activity is not subject to the national regulatory authority. I am talking about courier services in the State. The liberalisation of that sector, including weight limits, means that the regulation of postal services will diminish in the context of the commission's establishment. For all that, however, this issue needs to be addressed. European agreements are in place to ensure competition within the context of a regulated body, such as An Post in this case. However, Deputy Stagg tabled the original question about the safety of mail, of which we should all take cognisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" />The most important issue I have raised in this debate is the introduction of a flat rate for Internet access and the arguments in favour of it are irrefutable. I have expressed concerns about the conflicting, rich and poor aspects of the information society that are developing in society. Those matters are of grave concern to the Labour Party and I am sure they are also of concern to the Minister. When I worked as a teacher I can remember seeing how articulate and literate children were who came from homes where books, magazine and newspapers were available. In the interim, there has been an expansion in the volume of audio, video, Internet and other IT material available in public libraries whose links with schools have been of great benefit to children. To a large extent, however, this represents a replacement of the reading activities that went on in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If children do not have access to reading material in the home they will be at a disadvantage. One of the positive aspects of digital terrestrial broadcasting is that it would enable RTE to provide limited access to the Internet. That is part of a solution, but digital terrestrial television is now on the back burner and I fear it will be a long time before there is any development in that regard. My point is that if children are disadvantaged in this way from the very beginning, they will not make up the lost ground when they get older. I have already alluded to the second chance education aspect. Many are now upskilling through various courses, but there is still a particular role which the Internet fulfils. It allows people to add to their knowledge and access a great deal of material without having to purchase books. This can supplement and enrich the courses being provided and give people the opportunity of making good the loss which occurred earlier in their lives.</P>
      <P>Everybody will acknowledge the valuable role of carers, many of whom have little or no financial provision made for them. A person looking after a disabled person or a senior citizen will have opportunities at various times of day or night to avail of the Internet. Those in that situation should be helped in every way possible as should disabled people or others who would benefit. Those suffering from a particular illness should have the opportunity to go on-line and, perhaps, receive relevant information on their illness. I am disappointed there is no provision to allow for the provision of flat rate access and, even at this late stage, ask the Minister to consider changing the Bill in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Shea and Jim Higgins for their interesting contributions to the debate on the Bill. Deputy Higgins asked how many responded to the public consultation process. There were some 220 respondents. I was <Col N="646" /> very pleased with the response. There were several meetings with representative bodies, including IBEC, the Internet consumers' group and various others. I had about 25 meetings in all. There was also a seminar jointly organised by IBEC and my Department involving many of the key players. There was a huge consultative process.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and I met representatives of the OECD about one year ago. They reflected on my policy document of the year 2000 mentioned in their report and public statements at the time as being thoughtful and refreshing. They used some of it in the context of what they were putting forward.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to the matter of responsibility for convergence which is provided for in section 12(6) of the Bill. The licensing of couriers and the safety of mail entrusted to them is not really a matter for the Bill. Licences are issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. While it is an issue, it is not one which comes within the responsibility of my Department.</P>
      <P>Both Deputy Higgins and Deputy O'Shea referred to an apparently widespread impression of delays in the office of the DPP, who says he has limited resources. Any crime which is indictable is referred to him. Breaches of a serious nature should be indictable. Most firms wish to conduct their business in a proper manner and avoid any breach of the law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the regulatory impact of the Bill. I have already mentioned the consultations we had with the OECD, whose recommendations are being implemented through the Bill. With regard to delays in bringing prosecutions, the Bill represents a substantial improvement on the current situation.</P>
      <P>The reason for the deletion of section 35 is that the Competition Authority Bill, which also included this provision, was enacted last week and it would not be appropriate to have it duplicated in this Bill. However, the provision for co-operation will remain.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the lopping of trees and access to land, the Attorney General has approved the Bill and not raised any constitutional issues in that regard. As Deputies are aware, any Act can be challenged.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reference to Ireland's strengths, the OECD referred to our emphasis on market openness, awareness of the need for continuing regulatory reform, responsiveness and flexibility, transparency of regulatory decision making and extensive use of public consultation. It picked these out as our strengths in the regulatory regime. It was in that context it praised our 2000 document on which the Bill is based. I share the concern expressed by Deputies that there would be inequity in Ireland in terms of Internet accessibility, which would lead to what has been termed a &ldquo;digital divide&rdquo;, which is a catch phrase that has developed, especially in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the new learning. Young people are wonderful with Internet access. They have no <Col N="647" /> fears and inhibitions and accept that they should, as a matter of right, be able to use the Internet and get information. Schools have an excellent array of educational aids in the information technology area. Huge sums of money have been made available, some of it sponsored by companies and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The same considerations apply to second chance education covering those who, for one reason or another, were unable to avail of a structured and formal education. They are able to be masters of the world. Knowledge is power and armed with information and knowledge, people are the equal of others. The old barriers of class and education can be quickly put to one side if people have the potential to use information technology, which is easily learnt, and then grow with it and gain and access information from all over the world. I constantly meet people whose lives have been hugely enriched by this revolution.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the CÁIT initiative. Approximately £4 million has been allocated under it last year and this year. Grants totalling between approximately &euro;60,000 and &euro;150,000 were allocated to groups throughout the country last year and again this year. They cover access to women's groups, early school leavers, those in areas of disadvantage and handicapped people. I met a carer's group that submitted an application. The Leas-Ceann Comhairle is aware of a very positive group that applied in his constituency. An outside body assesses submissions. These groups have spread knowledge of the Internet and the means by which it can be used.</P>
    <P>The CÁIT initiative has been very successful. It reminds me of the community employment projects, with which I was involved when I was a Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs. They also reached out and did good for the community. Like the home school liaison scheme introduced in 1990, the initiative has had a huge effect on education.</P>
    <P>I hope we can reach a compromise that will help in the provision of broadband facilities. We cannot compel people to provide them at a flat rate but I have in mind a compromise proposal which, I hope, will incorporate elements of what is being suggested by the Deputies on the other side of the House. They could form part of an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

Section 8 deals with the dissolution of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation while section 9 deals with the transfer of functions. Section 9 fails to make reference to the officers of the ODTR. The reference is to the officers of the Minister. This does not appear to provide for continuity in the scenario presented, the transfer of functions from the Minister to the ODTR in the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 and transfer of those functions to the commission. For the sake of continuity, one would expect to see a reference to officers of the ODTR and-or the Minister becoming officers of the Commission for Communications Regulation and-or the Minister. Furthermore, there is no definition of &ldquo;officers&rdquo; although a distinction is made later in the Bill between officers, staff and consultants. That appears to be an omission.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), lines 1 to 4, to delete paragraph (<i>e</i>).</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete paragraph (<i>e</i>) which states: &ldquo;to ensure compliance, as appropriate, by persons in relation to the placing on the market of communications equipment and the placing on the market and putting into service of radio equipment&rdquo;. Nowhere in existing EU telecommunications legislation do the directives vest national regulatory authorities with such power. If the power in section 10(<i>e</i>) of the Bill is exercised by the communications commission in respect of the existing Irish market for communications and radio equipment imported from member states, it will be a breach by Ireland of its legal obligations in Community law under Article 28 of the EEC treaty.</P>
      <P>The wording for this function appears to have been lifted from the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, without too much consideration having been given to the EU angle. It is a breach of Article 28. In the Laurentiu decision in the Supreme Court, Keane C.J. cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of the 1926 Act. Several commentators believe that if it were challenged, it would be found to be unconstitutional. The role of the communications commission should be limited to prosecuting and prohibiting the unlawful use of spectrum by users of the equipment, but the actual importation of the equipment itself would seem to cut across Article 28 of the EEC treaty, that is, the free movement of goods and persons.</P>

      <P>I listened to the argument advanced by my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins. Reading the section an issue occurs to me regarding health and safety factors relating to communications equipment which we all meet in our constituencies. Will the Minister clarify whether this subsection in the section on the functions of the new commission has relevance to health and safety factors related to the telecommunications <Col N="652" /> or communications equipment? I hope that this in some way refers to standards being implemented so that there is no doubt that conditions laid down are in line with World Health Organisation standards or whatever is necessary in that area to ensure public health and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer Deputy O'Shea first, I do not know if it overtly has any such relevance. On health and safety, the Deputy is correct that this relates to standards but not to the details. The Deputy is asking if the commission goes into the details of health and safety standards in any production of information technology equipment and if it underpins it, authorises it or has authority over it. I very much doubt that it would have authority or power to validate matters such as that but health and safety standards are referred to the regulator and the commission in many cases.</P>
      <P>The debate on health, particularly with regard to masts, equipment and how people regard those matters, is ongoing and lively. I do not have the answers to it and it appears that the Department of Health and Children does not have them either. That Department quotes the World Health Organisation on the relevant levels.</P>
      <P>No doubt radiation is a topic of great interest to people but I cannot give a guarantee on that matter. The current commission goes by WHO standards on levels of radiation and all the standards which are trotted out as being part and parcel of the safety environment for provision of such equipment and the new commission on regulation will also go by them, yet again and again anecdotal evidence is brought to the attention of Members of the House. There is then the inherent conflict in having 600 or 700 gathered in a huge community hall demanding that there not be a mast within a particular area, but with mobile telephones going off constantly throughout the meeting. Does one want modern technology and, if so, can the regulator, and the planning authorities in the case of the erection of masts, ensure that they are not near houses and schools? Often this is difficult to achieve.</P>
      <P>If we do not encourage and bring in such modern technological usage, can we march forward as a nation? However, there are strong health worries about a production such as this. Both Etain Doyle and the new commission would have responsibility in that regard, but not in saying categorically that such an instrument or provision is entirely safe because I do not know who could say that.</P>
      <P>To turn to Deputy Higgins's amendment, it seeks to delete paragraph (<i>e</i>), which states: &ldquo;to ensure compliance, as appropriate, by persons in relation to the placing on the market of communications equipment and the placing on the market and putting into service of radio equipment.&rdquo; The Deputy wondered, in light of the Laurentiu decision, if this would be unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12(1)(<i>e</i>) clarifies that the commission will have the functions conferred on the director <Col N="653" /> under the European Communities Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Regulations, 201 &ndash; S.I. No. 241 of 2001. Therefore the removal of this provision, as put forward by the Deputy, will not change the <i>status quo</i> as the commission will have the functions under the statutory instrument in any event. The Deputy said that because this is in the Bill, it would be a new function, but it is only a clarification of the function which the regulator has anyway and which the commission will have &ndash; the regulator has that function under a statutory instrument introduced last year.</P>

The Deputy is saying that there is a conflict in regard to the issue of the free movement of goods and there is a previous recommendation in the High Court or the Supreme Court, but I am informed that the removal of this provision will not change the <i>status quo.</i> I expect that we made such provision to clarify the <i>status quo,</i> to give it the underpinning of law as distinct from the underpinning of a statutory instrument.</P>

The functions of the commission shall be &ldquo;to ensure compliance, as appropriate, by persons in relation to the placing on the market of communications equipment and the placing on the market and putting into service of radio equipment.&rdquo;  With what will it ensure compliance? It states &ldquo;compliance, as appropriate,&rdquo; but it does not state with what it will ensure compliance. It is a general statement in terms of placing equipment on the market or putting equipment into service. It talks about compliance but does not clarify with what one will be complying &ndash; it just states &ldquo;as appropriate&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were WHO standards in which people put their faith in this area, the commission would adhere to those standards. There would also be standards of invention, of the production of such equipment. I imagine the commission would have to adhere to technical standards, WHO standards and ISO standards of <Col N="654" /> production, with which more and more companies are asked to comply. These are the various standards which would be appropriate in different connections. That is all I can offer the Deputy from my knowledge.</P>
      <P>There are various EU compliance measures on companies operating and producing goods in the European market and they are growing in complexity all the time. There would have to be adherence to all those various standards of excellence, where appropriate, in regard to particular goods or products. One could not prescribe the standards to which every single product would adhere but there are appropriate European standards of equipment.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to labour the point. I understand that the health aspects are dealt with through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and that Forbairt is the body which does the investigation in that regard.</P>
      <P>I want to ascertain if &ldquo;compliance, as appropriate&rdquo; would refer to whatever health and safety standards apply as per guidelines in other Departments, as well as EU standards, which the Minister mentioned. Is it the Minister's view that &ldquo;as appropriate&rdquo; applies to standards of any Government Department or agency that apply to this sort of equipment, and that it is a catch-all for the standard? I am not being critical of the Minister in this matter, but that is a little bit slipshod in regard to the various sorts of standards and guidelines that exist across a wide range of bodies. Maybe something like this should give rise to a statutory instrument or some other method of clarification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, this follows statutory instruments of various Departments and various European directives which lay out standards of compliance and adherence. In the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment there could be 20 standards, to which it should adhere. There could be WHO standards and others in the Department of Health and Children to which it should adhere. The range of products used in the making of such a product would give rise to many other supplementary types of adherence. It would not be apposite to list all that in a line such as the one to which we are referring. &ldquo;Appropriate&rdquo; means appropriate to any of the relevant Departments implementing the various directives in all of their phases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasingly, there is a high range of quality standards to which companies making products, if they hope to sell them, must adhere. The Deputy knows that the firms who get the ISO regard it as a badge of honour. It is a very regular practice for companies, as they carry out their work, develop their products or services and implement them, to seek it and go through a rigorous audit to do so and to keep it. To list everything would be very difficult. I accept Deputy O'Shea's point <Col N="655" /> in this regard, but changes and additions are made almost by the minute.</P>

      <P>When I took up my current position, Dr. Tom McManus, a very fine person to whom the Deputy might have spoken and who deals with many matters, was very interested and remains very interested in the health outcome of technology and the use of technological equipment. One job of the Department of Health and Children is to monitor health risks. Throughout the UK, Europe and the world, one will find people drawing attention to electricity poles and high-tension wires. They will say wires should be under ground, not over ground, and that such things are injurious to health. One comes into one's kitchen in the morning and hears one's refrigerator and cooker humming and wonders whether there should be such a hum. I do not know if anybody can give a definitive statement as to whether one's microwave, hairdryer, cooker or whatever is emitting signals suggesting that something is wrong. However, is one going to do without one's electric cooker? Is one going to do without one's hairdryer &ndash; I suppose one could do without that all right &ndash; or is one going to do without other equipment that one has come to depend on?</P>
      <P>Equally, are we going to give up our mobile phones? We all seem to love them. Yet, we wonder about masts and give out when we try to change from an 086 prefix to an 087 prefix and back to an 086 prefix and cannot get coverage in many areas. One cannot have coverage without masts. Are masts injurious to health? That is the eternal question. Do we take four steps backwards and say we will do away with all those things? Where would that end? I get dozens of letters from people who are genuinely worried about the health risk of all these appliances and modern technological aids. Do we want to go back to the time caveman? I have no answer to the question.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), line 36, to delete &ldquo;a&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an efficient and competitive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If this amendment were made subsection (1)(<i>c</i>) would read &ldquo;to promote the development of the postal sector and in particular the availability of a universal postal service within, to and from the State at an affordable price for the benefit of all users.&rdquo; On Second Stage I alluded to the need for An Post to become more competitive. I tabled this amendment because we must promote competition in the postal sector and set down clear objectives for the commission. During Question Time before the Easter recess, I raised the issue of the consequences for An Post of the proposed European Union liberalisation directive. An Post would need to sharpen up its act in terms of being efficient and competitive.</P>
      <P>In terms of efficiency, major problems still exist with the delivery of mail. Despite the direct rail link, it can take up to three days for a letter to get from my office here to my constituency office in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, which is only 123 miles away. There are problems with sorting offices, transit and so on, despite the fact that SDS is an improvement on the previous position. God be with the days when we had the &ldquo;thrupenny&rdquo; stamp which guaranteed that a letter posted in any part of the country would reach its destination within 12 to 14 hours. The objective of the amendment is that the service should be efficient and competitive.</P>

      <P>If I post a letter in Dublin to Athlone, 70 miles away, before 10 a.m. on a Wednesday, it will not get there until midday on Friday. I often address a letter to myself to see how long it takes to be delivered. I know An Post and its employees are doing their best, but the length of time it takes to deliver letters is extraordinary. I do not know what Deputy O'Shea can tell us about the length of time it takes letters to get from Dublin to Waterford.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete, at subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), line 36, &ldquo;a&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an efficient and competitive&rdquo;. The regulator got her powers in regard to the postal sector under a European directive for the development of the internal market of community postal services and the improvement of quality of service &ndash; statutory instrument 130 of 2000 applies. Neither the EU directive nor the statutory instrument gives the regulator the power to monitor efficiency. The directive refers to the provision of a universal service, to which we all aspire, and the wording of section 12(1)(<i>c</i>) reflects the intent of that directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extending the objectives of the commission to promote the development of an efficient postal sector is not envisaged by the directive or by the statutory instrument. The main focus of the direc<Col N="658" /> tive is on fair competition and quality of service. Efficiency is an internal matter for the management of the company. If we were to regulate efficiency it would involve much more detailed intervention in the operations of a company.</P>
    <P>The regulator, who is now the appointed postal regulator as well as the telecommunications regulator, has made major interventions in policy within the postal sector. She is in command of pricing and has made a decision on a price increase for postal services. In terms of handling her brief on postal matters, she has, understandably and correctly from her point of view, sharpened the relationship between herself and An Post, as evidenced by the excellent chief executive of An Post, John Hynes, who is not afraid to put himself into the public arena. He has interchanges with the regulator who can afford to be equally sharp, as befits her job. The way the regulator interprets the directive will surely lead to a better service because she insists on quality of service. When the three of us met recently at the opening of the new postal facility on the Naas Road, we had a good discussion about that.</P>
    <P>On the onset of competition in the postal market &ndash; I gave an answer in the Dáil about this to Deputy O'Shea &ndash; we agreed a measure some months ago in Brussels. We are in the first phase now, leading on to the second phase in 2006, with the final phase in 2007 or 2008. No country has sought a derogation. Some countries wanted the measure introduced more rapidly while others had the opposite view, but in the end it was agreed by common consent.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that competition is being introduced as per the agreement in Brussels. Another Government might decide to introduce it more quickly, although there will not be a derogation because we all agreed to the timeframe. Some countries have gone far ahead of what we all agreed in Brussels. What we are doing is in line with what was agreed in Brussels, namely, a gradual liberalisation of the postal market. The stages of that liberalisation, as laid out in the directive, will take place between now and 2009.</P>
    <P>The regulator is adhering to the directions in the directive giving her responsibility for the operation of the postal market. She will ensure, for instance, that my letters from Dublin to Athlone will arrive within a precise period, as will those sent by Deputies Higgins and O'Shea to Ballyhaunis and Waterford. This is similar to me coming in here and asking why the No. 11 bus to UCD was late yesterday morning. We could not possibly go into precise details, but the regulator's broad remit in dealing with the postal sector will ensure a sharper carrying out of duties and an improved quality of service. She has already locked horns with An Post about quality of service, which is what we are all talking about here.</P>
    <P>All of these matters have implications for staff and the way they conduct business and there is no doubt they will be subject to the commission's regulations. I agree with what Deputy Higgins <Col N="659" /> said. We all want a more efficient service and I am sure that is what An Post wants. It knows it will eventually have to face full-blooded competition. The universal service is agreed to by all so I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's amendment because the application of such a provision could have an untoward effect on the gradual liberalisation in which we are engaged. Planned and proper liberalisation will lead in time to a much more competitive, efficient and better service.</P>

        <b>: </b>We recently debated the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Bill, 2001, and prior to that we had the Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998. In both of those Bills we encountered words such as &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; and &ldquo;competitive&rdquo;. Here a similar liberalisation is taking place in the postal service. Why should we not accept the same level of efficiency and competition as we do in the gas and electricity sectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point. I remember that for the electricity Bill &ndash; Deputy Jacob was responsible for the gas Bill &ndash; these things were much more sharply defined. By 2005, all countries are to have full competition in the electricity sector and we are at 40% market opening. We are not as advanced in terms of postal liberalisation. Interestingly, every single country in Europe regards the postal service as a very strong domestic issue. In the UK, because Consignia seems to want to rush ahead of the planned gradual liberalisation, there will be 30,000 redundancies within the next two months, which it is hoped will be voluntary, although I do not know whether they will be. I am all for electricity and gas being opened up much more sharply but An Post has its universal service obligations. If one receives electricity one receives it no matter whose electricity comes through the conduit &ndash; it does not really matter in the end. However, if one is in a remote area of County Kerry waiting for the postman one is very glad to see him. He or she delivers the post and that is the universal service obligation. It is a much more important issue domestically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" />The usage of the words &ldquo;the development of the internal market&rdquo; reflects the intent of the directive and the improvement of quality. The main focus of the directive is fair competition and quality of service. The quality of service reflects efficiency in itself but the precise application of efficiency is an internal matter for the management of the company. When competition is gradually introduced, if a company is not efficient it will not survive.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) to promote the use of the internet at affordable prices.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment gets to the nub of the issue raised by Deputy O'Shea and me, the promotion of the use of the Internet at affordable prices. We have been inundated with suggestions, proposals and ideas from various interested groups, both providers and customers, and this is the issue that has triggered the biggest response from the public. Our e-mail in-boxes and fax machines are literally jammed with faxes and e-mails suggesting that this issue needs sorting out. Leaving aside economic considerations, the heart of this issue is equity. Deputy O'Shea gave the global figure for the price of connecting to the Internet for a month and I gave the cost comparisons with other countries. We are talking about a huge obstacle to access to information which affects the establishment and development of new businesses and the opening up of huge market opportunities. We are talking about an obstacle which is leading to the restriction of access for rural areas.</P>
      <P>If one has a proper flat-rate, broadband service one can live anywhere in the country with the same ability to access one's business or whatever sources of information one requires. We are not just talking about EU countries. For example, in Iran it costs &euro;35 to connect to the Internet for a month; in Russia, &euro;38; in the USA, &euro;34; and in Ireland, thousands of euro. We are doing irreparable damage to ourselves by not tackling this issue. Has anybody &ndash; the Minister or somebody in her Department &ndash; sat down with the service providers to try to work out a deal similar to that which applies in Britain, France, Iran or Russia? If it can be done in those countries it can surely be done here. I know it is private companies which are involved, but they depend on the Government and on local authorities to facilitate them. It is an issue that must be tackled and that is the reason for this amendment. To promote the use of the Internet at affordable prices is a desirable, fundamental and necessary objective.</P>

      <P>I will not go over old ground nor repeat any of Deputy Higgins's arguments. I want to put on the record, however, my summary of key points. I have mentioned the Forfás report <Col N="661" /> on broadband investment in Ireland, but it bears mentioning again. It clearly states that creating regulatory certainty is the key to attracting the required broadband investment from operators. It also says that the passage of the Communications (Regulation) Bill in early 2002 is critical to this. It is important to empower the regulator to introduce a flat-rate interconnection package to enable competitive flat-rate Internet access. I have gone through the social arguments.</P>

      <P>I take the point. It is about empowering the regulator, which in this context is the new commission, to introduce a flat-rate interconnection package to enable competitive flat-rate Internet access. As Deputy Higgins pointed out, this is important on two fronts. The social considerations are hugely important to me but small businesses must also be taken into consideration. Bigger business will be able to make good deals with operators. The need for this amendment is twofold: it is important for small businesses and for all the categories we mentioned earlier. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in those points and in answer to Deputy Higgins, we are tired of sitting down with the operators and asking them to do as he suggests. An amazing event took place this week &ndash; nobody knew apart from us that this Bill was to reach the floor of the House today. The feeling among the various companies was that it would never reach the floor of the House before the Dáil was dissolved. We have still not divined the Taoiseach's intentions in respect of the latter, but it was believed that the Bill would not be introduced with the result that everyone sat back comfortably. However, as today's newspapers show, many things happened yesterday. DSL is now ready to be rolled out and the regulator has settled her differences with the companies. The current position is that the companies love the regulator, she loves them and they love me. We reached a plateau of sweetness and harmony together on the day before the Bill was introduced because no one believed it would be brought before the Houses. They all rushed to show how good, kind and wonderful they are when, in reality, they have been tearing their hair out in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to other countries which have far better services and Internet access. <Col N="662" /> These were provided, in the main, when companies were flush &ndash; many have since gone out of business &ndash; when there was an entirely different regime and when the outlook for the telecommunications industry was extremely optimistic. We were way behind these countries in terms of development. When we entered this area, the fortunes of the technology companies had already taken a nosedive. However, they are beginning to reassert themselves. We will be providing a sum of &euro;165 million in three phases over a three year period &ndash; I thank Deputies Jim Higgins and O'Shea for their kind comments in that regard &ndash; for the urban metropolitan fibre optic network hubs that will be created in conjunction with the local authorities most of which have been remarkable in terms of acceding to meeting us halfway on this proposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins's amendment proposes that we insert a new paragraph which would read &ldquo;to promote the use of the internet at affordable prices.&rdquo;  We are bringing forward an alternative to that proposal. It is remarkable that, in all the years I have been guiding through legislation in the Houses, amendments brought forward by Opposition Members can never be accepted as drafted and must be tweaked by the parliamentary counsel. We are proposing the insertion into section 12(2)(<i>c</i>) of a new subparagraph (v) which will read &ldquo;encouraging access to the Internet at reasonable cost to users.&rdquo; The commission's function in relation to Internet access is also included in section 10(1)(<i>a</i>). Obligations in respect of Internet access on operators are contained in regulations implementing EU law. There is great affinity between Deputy Higgins's amendment and my alternative. I would be glad if he would accept that my amendment reflects the spirit of the amendment in his name.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes giving the commission powers to require operators to provide other operators with bitstream services and flat-rate interconnection services. This proposal is addressed in the new EU electronic communications regulatory package adopted recently. The appropriate powers will be given to the regulatory commission when the directives are transposed into Irish law this year. If we were to deal with this matter now, the Deputy's proposal would be insufficient.</P>
      <P>There are many complex aspects that would have to be addressed if we were to deal with the proposal. These include the type of operators to which the obligation would apply &ndash; under EU rules, the policy would be to only impose the main regulatory obligations on operators with significant market power &ndash; to define the markets and all sorts of other matters. These issues would have to be addressed if this obligation were to be proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is proposing that the commission would require &ldquo;an operator to provide other operators with bitstream services and flat-rate interconnection services and set prices for these services.&rdquo; The amendment elaborates somewhat on what I said on Second Stage, namely, that the difficulties arising are where the incumbent will be forced to provide access to existing facilities. The Deputy's proposal is addressed in the new EU electronic communications regulatory package adopted recently and powers, not just the two to which the amendment refers but many others, will be given to the regulatory commission. The package deals with the types of network access that are to be allowed, the way in which charges for the service can be calculated, the powers of the commission to amend the terms and conditions, etc. What the Deputy is bringing forward in the shape of a very fine amendment will be adopted within the next six to eight months under the EU electronic communications regulatory <Col N="664" /> package.

        <b>: </b>That is correct. When the current incumbent at the head of the ODTR left the country or was unable to fulfil her function she vested her powers in a person who was also a consultant. While this person has now left the ODTR, the decision was obviously wrong because it left open the possibility of the independence of the ODTR being compromised. The person chosen should be an officer of the commission rather than a member of the staff, as these can be consultants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely understand the Deputy's point because it relates to a case which was in the public arena about six or nine months. Section 17 states: &ldquo;The Commission shall, where there is not more than one Commissioner appointed under <i>section 15,</i> designate a member of its staff as a deputy member of the Commission (&ldquo;deputy commissioner&rdquo;) who shall assume and carry out with the authority of the Commission all of the functions of the Commission in the absence of the Commissioner&rdquo;. This section requires the commission to designate a member of its staff as a deputy member of the commission to assume the authority of the commission where there is not more than one commissioner. The Deputy's point is that the person in question should be an officer rather than a member of the staff. However, &ldquo;staff&rdquo; implies permanency whereas &ldquo;consultancy&rdquo; does not. I understand that the case to which the Deputy refers involved a temporary consultant who was operating as a member of staff.</P>

    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána should stick to their job. I believe in the old saying, &ldquo;one person, one shop&rdquo;, and the same applies in this case. If one is in an office which is making key commercial decisions, there should not be a provision to allow him or her to have a partnership in a company or to be a nominee. He or she must leave the meeting as he or she must not seek to influence it. The operation and staff should be at arm's length from it. I am not only talking about someone leaving a meeting or not seeking to influence a decision, the person should not be within an ass's roar of the operation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point means that any undesirable leanings would have to be observed at the interview stage or during the appointment process. Every day in the business pages of every newspaper we find cases where employees, sometimes at a high level, stand accused of matters which do not follow the laws of interviews. Our proposals may be overly zealous, but I do not make any apology for being overly cautious or seeking to discern and deal with anything which might later develop if, for some unfathomable reason, the incumbent becomes greedy and seeks pecuniary aid. I am only talking about exceptional cases. It is better to be overly zealous when dealing with it if it happens rather than asking afterwards the reason statutory means were not provided to deal with the transgression. Otherwise, the employer, that is, the Minister or the Government, could be open to litigation by the employee if attempts are made to remove him or her. He or she will want to know on what grounds they are being removed. There could be cases of unlawful dismissal and all types of allegations. We have come across issues in the Department in the five years I have been there. I am not talking about the civil servants, but about the companies with which we must deal. Who could have known what was going to happen in one State company last year? We do not know the outcome of that situation. People change and move. I do not make any apology for being overly zealous in that regard.</P>

However, if information is given confidentially but is needed in the enactment of the duties of the other body, it is proper that it is passed on. That is the nature of confidentiality and the usage of information as would be necessary under the proposed legislation. This section of the Bill, which is now surplus, provided for co-operation between the Commission for Communications Regulation and the Competition Authority. This provision has been overtaken by events, particularly the recent enactment of the Competition Act which was signed into law and allows for and builds upon the measures there.

        <b>: </b>The Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, is the sponsoring legislation here. Section 38 states that regulations shall not be made by the commission under that Act other than with the consent of the Minister. In the Supreme Court case, the Laurentiu decision, Mr. Justice Keane cast serious doubt over the constitutionality of the 1926 Act. I know that the Minister said that anything can be challenged, but the general feeling is that the judge's observations should be taken very seriously. There is a major question as to the constitutionality of the 1926 Act. I do not know whether the Attorney General has advised to this effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>This section provides that regulations should not be made by the commission under section 6 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, other than with the consent of the Minister. Section 6 enabled the Minister to make regulations with regard to licences granted under that Act, including their form and the manner in which such licences may be suspended or revoked etc. This power was transferred to the ODTR under the 1996 Act and it is proposed to now pass it on to the commission following the 1996 Act and this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government took this amendment, the commission would be empowered to introduce secondary legislation and this is a function of the Minister of the day. It is not appropriate to transfer such legislative powers to an unelected executive body such as the commission. The compilation, production and enactment of legislation should be within the remit of the Oireachtas and <Col N="671" /> the Minister of the day. This would take that away from the Minister.</P>

      <P>With regard to enforcement, I want to raise the issue of offences on indictment as against summary offences. Is there any mechanism that could be put in place to expedite prosecutions under indictment. I am not suggesting that we seek to influence the DPP's independent office but because of the delays in that office, the new fines, including those of 10% of turnover, are self-defeating if there are gaps of years between the offence and the matter coming before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to tell the DPP to adopt a mechanism nor is it in the remit of my office to tell the DPP how to run his. I take the Deputy's point that where we go to the trouble of having huge fines to act as a deterrent, the effect of that will be lost if the imposition of those fines takes a long time. Yet, indictable offences reach all sections of life. When a certain amount of money is reached, offences become indictable offences. It is not my job to work out an initiative on how the DPP should deal with that smartly. I am not saying that the DPP is not smart and hope that I do not get a letter about this. However, he is independent in the execution of his duties and I cannot make further observations on that matter.</P>

However, if a special new section was set up within that office to deal with this area, there could be a way around this. I understand that this is not within the Minister's remit and that she cannot deal with it, but this issue is serious enough in terms of the <Col N="672" /> development of the sector that something like that could be proposed to Government.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>the steps he proposes to take to prevent the illegal labelling of untraceable Argentinean and Brazilian beef as Irish beef for use in the catering trade; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplies of beef from non-EU countries, including Argentina or Brazil, may enter the EU and be sold legally anywhere on the EU market. This beef can be imported into the EU on payment of EU tariffs or under certain agreed preferential quotas operated under the WTO. A condition of entry to the EU is that the beef must meet all EU veterinary and hygiene standards. Although Ireland exports more than 90% of its beef production, quantities of third country beef have been imported into Ireland under these arrangements. These imports have been largely used for further processing, the bulk of which is then re-exported. A small quantity of imported beef is also used in the catering trade.</P>
      <P>EU regulations on beef labelling require operators involved in the marketing of beef to label their beef with a reference number to permit traceability to the animal or group of animals from which the beef was derived, details of the slaughterhouse and the de-boning hall and details of the origin of the animal. With regard to beef imported into the EU, for which not all of this information is available, operators marketing that beef are required, at a minimum, to label its origin as non-EC and to indicate the country of slaughter.</P>
      <P>While these regulations require that beef sold to the catering trade must be labelled so as to provide the caterer with the necessary information to assure traceability there is, however, no obligation under these regulations for caterers themselves to forward that information to their customers. In the absence of such an obligation, Bord Bia has introduced its Féile Bia initiative, which I fully support, where participating restaurants, hotels, etc, agree to indicate the source of the food they serve so that all consumers, whether they purchase beef in retail or catering establishments, are fully aware of the origin of the product. I believe that this initiative deserves the fullest possible participation. While I am not aware of any instances where third country imported beef has been illegally labelled as Irish, it is clear that there is sufficient quantity of top quality Irish beef available to fully supply the Irish catering sector.</P>

He was not available to attend the joint committee yesterday. I know he has duties elsewhere, but it is clear that, at the end of this term, <Col N="676" /> the Minister has little regard for his obligations to the House.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that an estimated 13 million portions of beef consumed in Irish catering establishments per annum come here from third countries? Is he aware there are serious allegations that a number of importers are re-labelling imported beef as Irish beef and making it available to the catering trade? Does the Minister agree that the measures currently in place for the treatment, labelling and description of third country beef coming into the EU are appallingly inadequate and that there is no guarantee, for example, that we are not importing into this country beef from parts of Argentina where foot and mouth disease is endemic and beef from parts of Brazil where nobody knows what feedstuff is being used and which may include hormones?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of allegations being made in the trade, but proving them is more difficult. I am aware that some people are reprocessing, but that is mainly for the purposes of sending it out of the country again. I would not be totally happy with the obligations under the world trade agreements about the labelling of beef coming in or its traceability. Irish caterers have a duty to support home industry, particularly when we have to export so much of our beef and the quality of Irish beef is now so good that they should be proud to take part in the Féile Bia. I have heard allegations that some restaurants, which support that initiative, use other beef. Bord Bia has been asked to investigate that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If these allegations are true, does the Minister agree that the Féile Bia initiative is being undermined? Can the Minister outline the inspection and control procedures that are applied in the case of third country beef that is imported here for processing and is then re-exported? Is the Minister confident that all the beef that is imported for re-processing is exported again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Bord Bia is investigating the matter because it is important that Irish beef does not become associated with the taste of foreign beef.

      <P>I expect the statutory appeals office to be in operation next month. Planning for the necessary staffing, accommodation and other resources is now well advanced and extensive discussions have been held with the staff associations and unions involved. The Civil Service Commission interdepartmental competition for the appointment of the director of the office was advertised in February 2002 and the selection process is nearing completion. The selection process for the appeals officers has been initiated and can be progressed further once the director of the office has been appointed.

      <P>Some of us have better memories than others. It was enacted in July 2001. There were many difficulties in setting up the office. At the time it was expected it would be built on the model of the social welfare appeals office. However, two problems arose. One problem related to staff to address the foot and mouth crisis, which was still going on last autumn even though everyone seems to have forgotten it now. The other issue related to the fact that when it was investigated it became apparent that unlike the case of the social welfare appeals office, technical staff would be needed, including agricultural science graduates, etc, to deal with appeals. That took longer to resolve than was anticipated. There were industrial relations issues, etc, that needed to be addressed to get this right. That is now progressing. In the meantime the existing appeals mechanism is operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Did some of these difficulties, delays and industrial relations issues arise because a decision was taken, as detailed in the Act, to recruit staff from the existing Civil Service? Does the Minister agree that had the advice of this side of the House been taken and we had provided for the employment of people from outside the Civil Service, many of these delays could have been avoided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is so. There were difficulties within the Department due to pressures of work. Regardless of the recruitment process, it takes time. The foot and mouth disease crisis put much pressure on the work of the management services division in the Department. In addition, there was considerable staff movement in the Department last year, which created its own difficulties. I do not think the Deputy's <Col N="679" /> suggestion would have made any material difference to the speed at which this could be done. The Deputy will be happy to note that this matter is now moving apace, premises have been located and the director will be appointed before the end of the month. I can definitely say that the election will not take place before the end of the month so the director will be in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated on numerous occasions in the House and elsewhere that on-farm inspections under the national beef assurance scheme and the dairy herd certification scheme should be carried out at the time of the annual herd test or at a mutually convenient time for the farmer and the testing veterinary surgeon.</P>
      <P>As regards the beef assurance scheme, detailed discussions have taken place over a four-year period with Veterinary Ireland and its predecessor organisation and the farming bodies concerning the arrangements for inspection of farms. A protocol for the conduct of inspections has been agreed both with Veterinary Ireland and the farming representative bodies. There is also universal acceptance that farm inspections should be carried out by the testing veterinary surgeon at the time of the annual herd test. There remains some resistance to the implementation of this scheme because of the supposed costs involved.</P>
      <P>In this respect, the legislation passed by the Oireachtas establishing the scheme states unambiguously that any costs incurred in securing a certificate of approval are the responsibility of the applicant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, &euro;43 million has been invested by the taxpayer in developing the cattle identification and tracing system which will underpin the beef assurance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national beef assurance scheme has been designed to assist the marketing of Irish beef by demonstrating strict implementation of high standards right through the production chain. It provides additional assurances to consumers of Irish beef and a marketing edge for our beef exports in the highly competitive and ever more discerning consumer markets in Europe. Ireland produces 500,000 tonnes of beef every year and the best return for farmers can only be gained if this prod<Col N="680" /> uct can be marketed in the higher value market segments, especially in the UK and continental Europe. To do so, the product must maintain a high level of consumer acceptance and confidence, particularly against a background of a sector recovering from serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the attitude of Veterinary Ireland which has continuously extolled the virtues of assurance schemes while at the same time undermining the implementation of the national beef assurance scheme. I call upon Veterinary Ireland to lend its support at this stage to the delivery of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the dairy herd certification scheme, the position is that a round of farm inspections was carried out in 2000 to meet the requirements of the scheme. I understand that inspections were generally undertaken at the time of the annual herd test. There is no reason similar arrangements should not apply in respect of the inspections scheduled to be undertaken this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister one would think the country is rife with agreement. If such agreement exists, however, why is there a problem now? Why have inspections not taken place in large parts of the country? Will the Minister confirm that the undertaking given in the PPF that this would proceed without any cost to farmers has been broken by the terms of the legislation? The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development reneged on a commitment on this matter, which was given to the House by the previous Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The 2001 foot and mouth disease crisis, both here and in other EU member states, has resulted in a clearer appreciation of the potential for frequent and unregulated animal movements to spread diseases. The critical importance of full traceability has also been highlighted, not just in the context of consumer protection but also to facilitate the tracking of animal movements and contacts in the event that a disease outbreak occurs.</P>
      <P>As I have said on a number of occasions, there are certain aspects of Irish agricultural life that may not be the same again. While certain activities and practices may have been regarded as traditional, it does not necessarily follow that they are consistent with current and prospective requirements in relation to animal health, disease prevention, traceability and other key concerns.</P>
      <P>The BSE and, latterly, FMD experiences and animal disease outbreaks in other EU member states have highlighted the need to critically question and, where necessary, alter traditional approaches to various aspects of the livestock trade in the interests of ensuring that the sector can have a secure and viable future. Traditional fairs and markets can be no more exempt from this necessary reappraisal than any other feature of the livestock trade.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the sale by auction of livestock must be conducted only in a licensed mart premises, as provided for under the Livestock Marts Act, 1967, as amended.</P>

      <P>I am extremely sorry that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is not here this evening. In March 2001 he gave a commitment when the legislation was going through the House. At that time I specifically asked the Minister whether a dealer from the west who bought calves in the south and brought them back to Mountbellew, Athenry or Ballinasloe would be allowed to sell them under the strict regime that was then laid down. The Minister's exact reply was as follows: &ldquo;Agents in my own part of the country are an important feature of small farming and I see no reason why they would not be allowed to do their traditional business, provided that it met the requirements of the legislation we are putting through&rdquo;. This is an about-turn. One would have thought that the Minister of State, above all people, would at least be pro-rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no scientific evidence that can prove one way or the other that bringing calves from <Col N="683" /> the south poses a risk. Such dealing is a necessary trade, although it is not carried out to the same degree as it used to be. It is terribly important for the west, as the Minister of State should know because he is looking after a western constituency. What are the precise disease implications under those conditions for registered dealers whose premises are licensed and who comply with all the requirements? What is to prevent them from selling calves as they always did? Will the Minister of State answer that question for the information of farmers?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development</askee>
      <Quest>the number of farmers who have withdrawn from the REP scheme; the numbers currently joined up; his views on this decrease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11902/02]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>When the first REP scheme closed to new entrants at the end of 1999, there were some 45,500 active participants. Some comments on the level of participation in the new scheme seem to be based on the mistaken assumption that the figure of 45,500 at the end of 1999 formed a base from which REPS should continue to grow. In reality, however, farmers join REPS for a five-year term and over 27,000 farmers have come to the end of their contracts since December 1999. Some 18,000 farmers are still in the first scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the new REP scheme was launched in November 2000, my Department has already received almost 19,000 applications and most of these are already in payment. I understand that another 7,000 applications are at the planning stage and have not yet reached my Department. Last year, the first full year of the new scheme, saw the highest number of applications ever received and processed in any year since REPS was first launched in 1994. Applications received by the end of this year are expected to overtake that record level again.</P>
      <P>Of the farmers in the first REPS who came to the end of their contracts since 1999, the information available to me indicates that between 80% and 85% nationally have already applied for the new scheme or are in the course of applying for it. Since the new REPS, though identical in most respects to the first one, is legally a separate measure, farmers who participated in the first scheme and wish to continue in REPS must submit a new REPS plan and a new application. This work has to be done by planners approved by my Department, of which there are 750, of whom only 635 have had plans approved under the new scheme to date. Consequently, the level of demand for the new scheme is giving rise to backlogs at the planning stage.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the level of uptake for the new scheme, which also includes a proportion of farmers who were not in the first one. There are a number of possible reasons that a comparatively small proportion of the farmers who participated in the first REPS are not applying for the new one. Many, because of age or other considerations, will not want to take on a further five-year undertaking. Others have undischarged financial liabilities from the first scheme and will be eligible to rejoin once they have discharged these. A number will be deterred by the cost of having plans prepared, while others will have decided on economic and other grounds to revert to more intensive farming methods than REPS will allow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Why have farmers withdrawn from the scheme? It is because they were driven to distraction by the level of bureaucracy involved? If there was a weed out of place, a big &ldquo;X&rdquo; was marked on the form. It was the most <Col N="686" /> bureaucratically administered scheme I have ever encountered. Is that not the real reason there has been a drop-off in the level of participation by farmers? The Minister of State cannot disguise the figures, no matter how he presents them, including the overlap of 18,000. Will he agree there is a slow-down in payment for those farmers who got through to REPS 2? Also, the level of payment is totally inadequate in relation to the level of bureaucracy involved. What is the position with regard to the 2,500 farmers who have submitted forms and what work has been done with regard to processing those forms over the past two weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not wish to quibble with the wording of the question, the issue is not that people are dropping out of REPS but simply that they are coming to the end of REPS 1. The statistics indicate that some 80% to 85% are rejoining and an approximately equivalent number of people who have not been in REPS are now joining. On the basis of applications currently in the pipeline, the number of participants looks like levelling off at 45,000. This raises a number of issues to which I have alluded in the publication of the commonage framework plans. At the end of that document I said quite clearly that, in the context of the mid term review of the rural development programme, the REP scheme had to be reviewed in various respects, including the issues which Deputy Penrose has mentioned, such as simplification of the scheme, the penalty regime and rates of payment. All those aspects are in the public domain, in the documents we have published and on the website in relation to the commonage framework plans. I accept that all of those issues are inhibiting factors. I am not sure whether the 70,000 target was realistic and I have my doubts about it. The farmers' organisations appeared to concur with me in that belief.</P>
      <P>The level of bureaucracy and paperwork is an inhibiting factor. We, in the Department, are looking at this to see what can be done to simplify it. Marginal land farmers, who have very low stocking rates and, therefore, whose pollution levels are zero and always was, are definitely turned off to a large extent, especially the older ones. I have directed my attention towards this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the limit on the scheme was £5,000 in 1994 and that it is now £4,750? Is he also aware that the cost of applying was approximately £400 to £500 in 1994 and that it is now £1,000? It means that, ten years later, farmers are getting much less. Does he not accept that this, and the level of bureaucracy, is grinding the scheme to a halt? Does he also accept that the administrators are failing to deliver?</P>

      <P>The payment has been static since 1994, but I have publicly signalled that I am addressing the issue. I am also addressing the <Col N="687" /> amount of paperwork involved. It is easy to blame administrators, but the reality is that every amount of money we pay must not only satisfy the auditors here but also EU auditors, who interpret these rules very strictly.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the fallen animal scheme, the rendering of all fallen animals delivered to approved plants and the disposal of the resultant meat and bone meal are subsidised by my Department. This arrangement, which includes sheep, was put in place at the same time as a subsidised collection service was set up for fallen bovines. While the collection from farms of fallen bovines is subsidised at fixed rates per collected animal, this aspect of the scheme does not extend to animals other than bovines.</P>
      <P>The fact that a comprehensive collection scheme for bovines at reasonable charges per animal collected is now in place, and the fact that non-bovines delivered to approved rendering plants do not incur a charge allows for the collection of sheep from farms at a reasonable charge. The option is also open to producers to deliver fallen sheep to registered knackeries where a nominal charge is imposed for taking the carcass to the rendering plant.</P>
      <P>In order to further facilitate farmers specifically in relation to the disposal of fallen sheep, my Department is currently examining the possibility of introducing a number of collection points at specified locations in order that the options available to sheep farmers are increased. All in all, I am satisfied that the scheme, as introduced by me last year at an annual cost of &euro;25 million, is working well and providing a good service for farmers.</P>

      <P>The matter is being fully considered, based on the number of animals that fall every year and the main areas in which they fall. Mountain sheep would be the most at risk. The collection points should be placed within reasonable distances of the mountain farmers in those regions. The number of collection points has to be decided. Every farmer is capable of bringing a dead animal to a collection point, especially sheep. They may not be able to bring a cow because it would have to be hauled onto a trailer.

What it means is that they pay different prices to different suppliers, depending on whether those suppliers <Col N="690" /> buy their seeds, fertilisers and agri-chemicals from the eventual purchaser of the grain. Is the Minister not worried that at least four of our major food processors are now engaged in this practice? Is he aware that in some cases the final grain buyers are telling producers that if they do not buy their seeds, fertilisers and agri-chemicals from them, they can find another customer for the grain? Does he not agree that this is a grossly unfair, anti-competitive practice which should be outlawed under EU law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The grain trade does not consult or notify the Department about price arrangements for grain purchases from farmers. That is a matter for negotiation between the farmer and the buyer. The IFA would also be strongly involved in that. Glanbia recently told its farmer suppliers that from this year a premium price will be paid to farmers who contract to purchase inputs from the co-operative to the value of &euro;50 for each tonne of grain purchased. A lower price will be paid to farmers who do not enter into those contracts. It is understood that Dairygold will operate a similar system. This has given rise to complaints from farmers that they will be forced to pay prices for their inputs which may not be competitive and that they may have to buy more inputs than they need. We understand there are also complaints from other suppliers of inputs because of the business they will lose.</P>
      <P>There are no rules in the Common Agricultural Policy for the regulation of grain purchasing and trading on the free market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the practice he has described can certainly require farmers to buy inputs at uncompetitive prices? By using that phrase he has accepted that this tiering is an anti-competitive practice organised by monopoly buyers to secure more advantage from weak sellers. It is, therefore, uncompetitive, exploitative and contrary to the intention of EU competition law. The Government's refusal to accept the Fine Gael amendment to the recent competition Bill is just another example of how little it cares about the position of farmers in the context of competition in the market.</P>

      <P>There is great strength to be found in groups coming together, as smaller co-operatives have done. Groups of farmers who produce grain can come together and provide their own storage. The Department has given substantial grants to a number of areas this year for storage of grain to ensure farmers can be independent in that way. They can hold their grain over a long period and they can come together in different groups. I am aware of individual farmers who have come together and formed strong groups. They are in a better position to negotiate because they not only have the quality but also the quantity to supply.</P>

Will he explain how his comments and his praise of farmers grouping in this way sit with the declarations of the Competition Authority early last year in the case of milk producers in Donegal and later in the case of beet producers in Carlow and other counties to the effect that there was a serious legal doubt over the ability of farmers to organise to negotiate prices? Will there be a rethink of the mistaken attitude taken by the Government to the application of competition law to agriculture?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in view of the continuing Israeli military operation in the Palestinian territories, which is reported to have led to the deaths of several hundred Palestinians, indeed, a massacre in Jenin, and a major humanitarian crisis as a result of the occupation and destruction of civilian infrastructure, his plans for Ireland, through the UN and the EU, to promote new initiatives that would bring an end to the Israeli occupation and the suicide bombings by Palestinian groups, especially having regard to the reported failure of the Powell mission to make progress and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has another engagement at this time and I hope the House will accept my efforts to stand in on this important matter.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Middle East remains a cause of grave concern. It has grown steadily worse in recent weeks and the reports now emerging from the Jenin refugee camp are harrowing in the extreme. The truth of what happened in Jenin must be established. The withdrawal of Israeli forces from Jenin and the announcement by the Israeli Prime Minister that further withdrawals will be made in the next few days may give some hope of a respite. In our view, there should be an immediate and total withdrawal from all the Palestinian administered areas. It must be clear to all that neither side can achieve its aims through violence. The only solution will be achieved by negotiation and will have to take account of the legitimate interests of both parties. Peace cannot be imposed, either by the stronger party or from outside. Any such attempt is doomed to failure.</P>
      <P>The recent visit to the region of the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, did not achieve the results we had hoped for. Nevertheless it represents a very serious engagement by the US Administration in the search for peace. It is clear that American engagement at that level is an indispensable condition for success. The US continues to be actively engaged on the ground with the parties. We shall continue to support the efforts of the US Government and those of the other members of the international quartet, that is, Russia, the EU and the UN. The statement by the members of the quartet after their meeting in Madrid at the start of Secretary Powell's mission on 10 April set out clearly the shared views of the international community as to the way forward towards resolution of this conflict.</P>
      <P>The Israeli Government should withdraw its forces without further delay, while the Palestinian Authority must make a 100% effort to end terrorism, particularly suicide bombings. It is essential to recommence negotiations leading to a resolution of all outstanding issues and a permanent solution which will allow the Palestinians a viable, democratic and fully independent state and allow Israel to live securely within internationally recognised borders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives are under consideration, including the idea of an international conference. I should say, of course, that no party can dictate who may or may not attend such a conference or insist on other unrealistic conditions being met before a conference is held. It is clear that the parties require the support of the international community to move towards a final settlement. The members of the quartet and peace minded states in the region would be logi<Col N="694" /> cal participants in the conference. Any conference must aim at a comprehensive and permanent solution and have a clear plan how to get there.</P>
    <P>Further international assistance is available to the parties in the form of monitors. It has long been the view of Ireland and our EU partners that an independent third party mechanism could be of benefit to both parties. The Government has decided that Ireland will make personnel available for such a monitoring mechanism if its establishment is endorsed by the UN.</P>
    <P>The Government has also responded to the emergency appeal from the UN agency charged with the welfare of Palestinian refugees by allocating an additional &euro;700,000 to its emergency programmes to provide shelter and health care to those most affected by the conflict. Other assistance from Ireland Aid to the Palestinians this year will amount to about &euro;4 million.</P>
    <P>On Monday of next week the Minister for Foreign Affairs will attend a meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in Valencia where he will again make our views known to both Israel and the Palestinians and consult with other interested states. The question of the Middle East is under discussion in the UN Security Council today and Ireland is actively engaged with members of the Council and other relevant delegations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister of State some very direct questions? At the meeting in Valencia will Ireland seek the cancellation of the European Union-Israel association agreement? Is it the Government's position that an immediate United Nations led investigation into the abuses at the refugee camp at Jenin should be facilitated forthwith and in that regard, what is the Government's position on the refusal by the Israeli Authorities to allow Professor Pounder, the only qualified forensic scientist in the area at present, access to the camp at Jenin to assess the manner in which people were massacred? Will he state whether the Government has expressed an opinion to the Israeli Authorities on their refusal to allow a visit, led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to the area? What is the Government's intention? Will these matters be raised at the Valencia meeting and will we get a statement on them from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen?</P>

      <P>I also asked what they are going to do at next week's meeting. I asked very specific questions. Will the Minister come out of that meeting without an independent investigation teams looking at the manner in which children and women were put to death and, furthermore, in which the infrastructure was bulldozed with half-buried bodies in it? Ireland and Europe are looking on at the European Union issuing fiddly statements while at the same time not supporting a UN investigation team and not addressing the 40% trade which the European Union has with Israel. That is the question and that is what I want answered.</P>

I had the experience and the honour of addressing the Euro-Med conference about a year ago. Given the Irish experience, what we have seen happening so far in the Middle East and the potential for really serious, major conflict to take off, will the Minister, at the conference to which my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, referred, take initiatives that will help concentrate the minds of both parties involved to use all the information at their disposal, both from the EU and UN, to bring about a cessation of the violence so at least some rationale will emerge by which wiser counsel will prevail and which will enable the crisis to be brought under control before it is too late?</P>

      <P>Deputy Durkan's point was well made, and I reiterate it. In all the fora in which the Government is involved, through the EU and UN, every effort is being made by the Government to ensure that a resolution in the Middle East is brought about in the context of the Israelis and Palestinians.</P>
      <P>We have stated publicly that violent conflict between both countries will not achieve an outcome. The only things that will lead to a positive resolution are dialogue, a cessation of all violence and a withdrawal by the Israelis from the Palestinian administered areas. Equally, there must be an end to the acts of terrorism on the part of the other side, particularly suicide bombings.</P>
      <P>This country has been to the forefront in all the fora in past weeks. I have just confirmed for Deputy Michael D. Higgins that the Government has been in direct contact with the Israeli Government to seek access for Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner.</P>

      <P>With regard to the EU influence, the experience of Srebrenica some years ago and the reluctance of the EU to take any initiative, will the Minister assure the House that there will be no repetition and that the EU, <i>en bloc,</i> will <Col N="698" /> not stand idly by and allow hostilities to continue with obvious consequences? Will the Minister assure us that he will take an initiative which will help to concentrate the minds of those involved and which will focus public attention on the central issue, namely a cessation of violence to allow peace initiatives to take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a more powerful quartet in the world engaged in this matter than the four bodies of which I spoke &ndash; the US Government, Russia, the EU and the UN. It issued a statement after its meeting on 10 April in Madrid which was unified with regard to what was happening between Israel and Palestine. The Irish Government, which is very much part and parcel of it, was very much supportive of that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy knows that it is not possible for some incredible or otherwise unilateral action to be taken by Ireland. We act in consort with our partners at the highest possible level. The quartet is a powerful combination of the international community working together in a very direct way with regard to what it has asked both Israel and Palestine to do. I have been explicit with regard to that in the House this evening. That is the way forward to end the present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address a few points made by the Minister of State. When the quartet, by which we mean the EU, the United States, Russia and the UN, met in Madrid, it was in expectation of there being a shift from military strategy towards diplomacy. Given that Havier Solana and the Presidency of the EU were refused access to Chairman Arafat, does the Minister of State not agree that was a humiliation for the European Union? I used the word &ldquo;humiliation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My next point is very specific. The purpose of the professor of forensic medicine at Dundee University, Professor Derrick Pounder, seeking access to the Jenin camp is that the bodies might be released to their families to be buried, that we might know the circumstances of the killings and the numbers. Of course, there is a need for humanitarian law. Are the Minster and the Government satisfied that the comprehensive breach of international law and the Geneva Convention &ndash; the fourth convention in relation to civilians &ndash; by the Israeli authorities is a serious cancellation of the guarantees given in the association agreement Israel had with the EU? </P>
      <P>My interest in this is very simple. How long does Ireland propose to go on accepting the breaches of international law in respect of all of these matters? For example, in reply to my argument the Minister of State said nobody was asking Ireland to do something unilaterally. We are simply asking the Minster of State to bring a message from this House to the meeting that will take place in Valencia. We want Ireland's presence on the Security Council to be shown publicly to be working in favour of international law by condemning its breaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" />We want an unequivocal statement at the Valencia meeting that there has been a breach of international law. How can anyone justify Israel's refusal to give access, for example, to the humanitarian agencies and ambulances to bring relief to people and the refusal to allow access to dead bodies for several days? How can that be acceptable? This is not a matter for quiet diplomacy. What people want is visible public action and statements on these breaches of international law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that as far as the Irish Government is concerned, our Minister for Foreign Affairs will be putting forward all of our views at the meeting in Valencia regarding all the matters the Deputy has raised. That goes without saying. I thought that I had made that absolutely clear in what I said earlier.</P>
      <P>With regard to the visit the Deputy mentioned by Havier Solana, as partners in the EU of course we would want to support decisions to gain access. It may not be helpful for me to stand here and say if it was a &ldquo;humiliation&rdquo;. It was certainly a great disappointment. One can strike a subjective view and go further if one wants. However, my point is that I do not want to negate in any way those future roles. The EU must show that it is a powerful institution operating in harmony with its members to get this message across. Of that there is no doubt.</P>
      <P>If there is another proposal for an international conference, we will support it. I take the Deputy's point on the expectations when the quartet met. As he knows, the statement was made in support of the mission that the Secretary of State for the United States was undertaking at the time by going to the Middle East. That has not been as successful as everybody hoped at the time. However, that is not to say that we must not work towards a resolution. I know the Deputy subscribes to that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement says several times in several paragraphs that we remain supportive of the new US initiative. The new US initiative has failed. What people who support the right of the Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace are asking for is an observable, separate EU initiative. This, unfortunately, is getting buried because the general perception is that the United States, for example, allowed much of what I described to take place for about two weeks before announcing that the Powell visit was going ahead. This is what independent observers are telling me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>To continue that theme, does the Minister of State accept that it appears the quartet, which is probably the most influential in the world, has failed and that that gives <i>carte blanche</i> to the ongoing conflict?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, that is the reality because there has not been a cessation of violence. Will the Minister accept that if the current violence continues, rather than living together the people in the region will die together? The rest of the world can no longer simply look on and wring their hands. If they have influence they should use it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs must use his considerable influence in the European Union and, through the United Nations and with the Americans, bring about a cessation of violence. It should be possible to do that in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>First, to answer Deputy Higgins's question, as I speak the UN Security Council is meeting to discuss these matters &ndash; I am not sure if it has yet concluded. Direct action is being taken as we speak. Second, Secretary of State Powell said that while he is disappointed with progress to date, he will continue his current efforts. Those of us in this country know that when we run up against failure, we do not give up, and that is the position of the Government. Deputy Durkan is not in dispute with me, nor is Deputy Higgins who has made his points well, and they can be assured that we will use whatever influence is available to us through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Department. We are playing a full role in all the fora available to us to end the violence in the Middle East, which is appalling the world. It is of no benefit to me to start apportioning blame. We want both sides in this conflict to cease violence. We want the Israelis to withdraw from the Palestinian administered areas and we want the Palestinians to stop suicide bombings. It would be a major step if we could achieve those two objectives. We have said that publicly and I repeated it tonight on behalf of the Minister. We continue to do that even as we speak through our ambassador at the UN today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks for us all when he says he wants the suicide bombings to end. The reason we want the Israelis to operate within international law is that their actions currently will not stop the suicide bombings but will ensure their continuance.</P>
      <P>I have noticed the decline in status of the Geneva Convention in our diplomatic statements and the scant references to international law. What assurances can the Minister of State give the House that international law and the Geneva Convention are being respected in relation to the siege of Bethlehem, for example, the right of those under siege to get food, water and medicines? We are required, as a Parliament, to address the issue but what transcends all of us are the principles of international law. How long do we intend to look on and see international law, not just UN resolutions, being flagrantly violated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has suggested a UN presence in the region but that has <Col N="701" /> been rejected. Access to President Arafat is rejected. The siege at Bethlehem continues and the international legal side of that is in tatters. Will the Government issue a statement that has to the forefront an international legal dimension and in particular reference to the Geneva Convention? Will that be contained in the statement following the Irish participation in the meeting in Valencia?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point but as far as the Irish Government is concerned, there is no question of setting aside either the Geneva Convention or any aspect of international law. That must be the bedrock on which we move forward and there can be no circumstances in which the Government would look at it in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right when he says that matters have occurred in the past two weeks that warrant serious investigation but the priority of all of us at this stage is to stop the violence. We must see an end to the current murder and mayhem. That is the focus but it in no way negates the Government's adherence to international law and the Geneva Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that all efforts to bring about a climate whereby some negotiation can take place appear to have failed, has the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and in conjunction with the EU and the UN, focused on a fall-back position which might be adhered to in the event of an initiative not coming forward which would bring about a cessation of violence in the short-term, having particular regard to previous experience in the Middle East, particularly in relation to refugee camps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Secretary of State Powell's return to the United States, he said he remains committed to this process. I should have said that he has left a very high level team behind him, much higher than was present before he got to the region. In that regard, serious engagement is continuing at the highest levels. We all wish that greater progress had been made and that the negotiations in the past few days would have produced an immediate resolution, but we know from experience here that is not the end of the process. The world cannot give up on this issue at international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer the second part of the Deputy's question, it is not a case of having a plan A or B. Every possible effort is being made through whatever forum is available to this country. Ireland has acted directly in speaking to the Israeli Government and getting access for the High Commissioner, Mary Robinson. We are acting directly with our EU partners. We are on the Security Council. We are at the forefront of all <Col N="702" /> these matters. It is an evolving process but the end game must be to end the violence immediately. That is the approach of the international community as well as Ireland and we will support whatever measures, through whatever forum, to ensure that happens.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter on the Adjournment. At midnight last night, I telephoned parents' representatives and board of management members of Aghamore national school, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, to let them know that I intended to raise the appalling conditions at the school on the Adjournment this evening. The parents were still at the school. They had just ripped up some floorboards and discovered yet more dead rats. For weeks, the stench of dead rats has been unbearable. The moment one opens the school front door the smell is noticeable. As a result, the board of man<Col N="703" /> agement had no option but to close the school this week.</P>
      <P>Until now, the rats were located behind the skirting boards. Last night's excavations delivered rodent carcases from under the floor and the excavations continue today. It now appears that the school will have to close for at least another week. What an appalling indictment of the Government.</P>
      <P>The school is 101 years old. It consists of three classrooms and a narrow hall. It has no indoor recreational area, very limited outdoor space for playing, no cloakroom, no staff room, no general purpose room and very limited toilet facilities. Shoes and coats are piled high in the narrow hallway. In this day and age, this is disgraceful. Last November I handed to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, a well put-together dossier of photographs showing the cramped and spartan conditions and the holes bored by the rats through the timber floors and skirting boards. It contained a series of letters from a cross-section of the pupils in the various classes begging, pleading and imploring the Minister to approve a new school building, but the Minister turned a deaf ear. He did not have the courtesy to reply or to acknowledge even one of the letters. The children of Aghamore have been left to languish in such unhygienic conditions that they have been told by their teachers not to let their packed lunches touch the desks for fear of contracting the deadly Weil's disease which is spread by rats.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that the Minister has not come into the House today because he has given clear assurances to the parents. On 8 February last the Minister visited Mayo and met a deputation from the school. He promised them that he would have the Department's planners out to inspect the school within two weeks. There are four suitable sites and there was to be a public private partnership. Yet nine weeks later the planners have not arrived. All the while the children of Aghamore have been suffering in accommodation that would not be tolerated in a Third World country. There is a seething anger in the Aghamore community. The people feel totally betrayed by the Minister. They see that £4 million is being squandered on a useless spire in the centre of Dublin and that £1 billion is being spent on a national stadium to satisfy the Taoiseach's ego. They see new schools in other areas replacing old schools not a fraction as dilapidated or unhygienic as their school. The irony is that this is a rural school whose pupil numbers are increasing and the projections are good. They are not prepared to wait and they should not be expected to wait. They want sanction for a new building and they want it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current <Col N="704" /> position regarding Aghamore national school, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo. At present, the school has a staffing level of one principal and two mainstream class teachers. The school also has a shared remedial and a shared Breaking the Cycle co-ordinator, neither of whom is based in the school. The enrolment at 30 September 2001 was 75 pupils. The school's facilities consist of three classrooms with sanitary facilities. The Department of Education and Science has received an application from the management authorities of the school for grant assistance towards the provision of improved accommodation. The Department will give detailed consideration to the application for improved accommodation from the authorities of the above school as soon as possible under the Government's expanded building programme.</P>
      <P>In the meantime there is clearly a need to ensure that any health and safety issues, including vermin infestation at the school, are attended to. In that regard the management authorities of Aghamore national school should continue to use funds from the minor works grant scheme for minor works to the school. If the cost of works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the scheme, the Department is willing to consider an application for grant aid towards such works. Since 1997 Aghamore national school has received &euro;23,322.54 under the scheme. I assure the Deputy that the Department of Education and Science is committed to providing improved accommodation for Aghamore national school and that the case will be kept under review. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity of raising this issue and I thank the Minister of State for coming in to respond. The scheme I refer to, unlike its predecessors, is fully funded by the Government and the taxpayer. Because of this it is imperative that this scheme, or indeed any scheme, is operated fairly and transparently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the replies to my parliamentary questions on this issue this afternoon, an injustice has been perpetrated on at least one applicant to this scheme. The applicant to whom I refer has operated a large scale family-run potato production business in Fingal for the past 15 years. In recent years the family has invested over £350,000 from its own savings and borrowings to upgrade facilities so that it can remain competitive and successful. The problem is that the family has no refrigerated storage facilities of its own, which puts it at a competitive disadvantage, especially as it is required to rent storage space from competitors who have received grand aid from the Department for investment in storage facilities and who do not produce anything like <Col N="705" /> the amount of potatoes produced by this company.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted by departmental officials that in terms of production, packaging and marketing this successful company is at the top of the scale of professional growers in this country. The application to the Department for funding of over $10,000 was professionally prepared and submitted in full and on time. The Department and indeed the selection committee dealing with the applications had no questions or queries about the application. The same cannot be said of the other applicants &ndash; with one exception, all the applicants were required to provide additional detailed information. The exception was the applicant to whom I refer &ndash; one of the 25 had all the information in detail and the others did not. Four of the 25 applicants who received funding under this scheme had also received it under previous schemes. One of these had received &euro;650,000 out of the &euro;2.1 million available at that time.</P>
    <P>At all stages this applicant met the main requirement of the scheme &ndash; he was applying for a grant towards the provision of storage facilities. There has to be a mistake here. The scheme was directed at the construction of new storage facilities and the installation of storage-related equipment. This application is tailor-made for the scheme and meets all its criteria. I would like the Minister to explain why a scheme operated within his Department seems to reward the same people with grant aid time and again. As I mentioned here this afternoon, four applicants received money in the past for the facilities the scheme is there to provide, but other producers do not seem to get a look-in. A grave injustice has been perpetrated in this case. I ask the Minister to see that this person's application is reviewed. If the applicant cannot provide these important storage facilities in the future he will possibly lose his house.</P>
    <P>In the context of the information made available this afternoon, other questions must be asked. I am asking for nothing but equal treatment for all applicants. I am convinced that this efficient, hardworking farmer has been unjustly treated and the consequences of this will be serious for the family involved. As a Dáil Deputy, if I did not highlight this case on the floor of the House I would be neglecting my responsibility. I am not prepared to turn a blind eye to injustice. I ask the Minister, who is known to be compassionate, to review the case of this applicant and see whether he can be accommodated. He deserves to be because of what he is producing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to the recent allocation of funding made under the capital grant scheme operated by my Department for the marketing and processing of agricultural products. This particular scheme applies to projects at or near farm level in the horticulture, potato, eggs, grain and livestock marketing and processing sectors. My Department is responsible for <Col N="706" /> that part of this measure which does not fall within the remit of the development agencies or alternatively is not covered by the Department's on-farm schemes.</P>
      <P>The amount available for disbursement by my Department for the potato sector in the recent call for proposals was &euro;2.1 million and the amount committed to date is &euro;1.796 million. Eligibility alone does not confer an entitlement to grant aid and all applications are required to undergo a competitive assessment and selection process. Of course, all projects must also comply fully with the provision of the EU guidelines for state aid in the agriculture sector and certain other conditions. To attract funding, projects must comply with certain provisions and must demonstrate financial viability.</P>
      <P>A total of 28 applications were received from the potato sector, all of which were evaluated by reference to viability, target markets, their sectoral and regional impacts, particularly at primary producer level, and the extent to which they would improve the saleability of the primary product. Two of the applications were found to be ineligible while a third was subsequently withdrawn, leaving a total of 25 to be considered. Between them, the 25 applications in the potato sector had a grant aid requirement of almost &euro;10 million while the funding available amounted to &euro;2.1 million. Following the assessment process, six projects involving grant aid of &euro;1.796 million were recommended and approved by my Department. The unallocated balance of approximately &euro;308,000 will be allocated shortly.</P>
      <P>The funding allocated to the potato sector will allow it to continue to grow and improve its facilities. This sector also attracted significant levels of grant aid under the FEOGA marketing and processing schemes in the two previous funding rounds covering the periods 1989-99. A total of &euro;21.08 million in national and FEOGA funds was paid out in respect of 70 projects. The FEOGA grants paid to the sector represents 7.63% of grants paid across all sectors under the two funding rounds.</P>
      <P>In addition to awards under the FEOGA funded schemes, funding was also provided to the sector under the on-farm investment schemes. Over &euro;8.89 million was paid out in respect of 450 projects under two funding rounds covering the periods 1991-93 and 1994-99. Under the regional operational programmes of the NDP 2000-06, a total allocation of &euro;5.5 million is available for the scheme of investment aid for the potato sector. Under this scheme, only projects involving total eligible costs in excess of &euro;10,000 and less than &euro;150,000 are considered.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there are disappointed clients. I can only reiterate that my Department made its selections in a fair and equitable manner. The funding available necessarily restricted the number of projects selected. There will be further calls for proposals over the lifetime of the NDP with the next call due in 2003.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to emphasise the importance of the scale and quality of the services provided by the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God at St. Raphael's, Celbridge, County Kildare, and those provided at a number of similar institutions, such as Islandbridge, throughout the country. There is no need to enumerate the various efforts invested in the provision of those services. I refer here to the efforts made on a voluntary basis by the parents and friends of St. Raphael's, the local community and the management and staff of St. Raphael's to put in place a service that is more urgently required with the passage of time. Everyone recognises that and, in fact, Her Excellency, the President of Ireland, and the Taoiseach both visited St. Raphael's in the past year in recognition of the efforts made there. Imagine, therefore, the disappointment, surprise and hurt on the part of those involved at St. Raphael's when it recently transpired that its budget for the current year has been reduced, in effective terms, to the extent of approximately &euro;2.9 million.</P>
      <P>We have lived with the Celtic tiger economy for the past number of years. We are informed that we have one of the most successful economies in the western hemisphere and that Ireland is one of the 20 wealthiest nations in the world. In my opinion the management, staff, parents and the children and adults involved at St. Raphael's would not be surprised if its allocation for the current year was made commensurate with the economic factors to which I refer. However, that is not the case. It is sad and disappointing that St. Raphael's budget has been reduced at this point.</P>
      <P>It is also sad that it appears that a great deal of effort has been put into providing services in various areas to meet the demands of various competing interests. What demand is greater than that of those who are not in a position to fight their own cause? What demand is greater than that of those who are assisting that cause on a voluntary basis? What need is greater than that of the children at St. Raphael's, Islandbridge and the other institutions which are obliged to depend on outside resources and the goodwill of fundraisers who operate on a voluntary basis? These people ultimately rely on the health services &ndash; the Department of Health and Children, the Minister and the relevant health board &ndash; to provide them with the necessary resources to carry out their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, the authorities at St. Raphael's will be obliged to consider curtailing existing services and not proceeding with proposed new services. The combination of these two will reduce the value and quality of the necessary services, either those in existence or those that are proposed. A letter was sent to the chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority pointing out that <Col N="708" /> there was a shortfall of approximately &euro;2.9 million in the 2002 budget which, effectively, is a reduction of 5.6%. There are four factors involved. There is a shortfall in the amounts provided for some approved pay awards. In other words, a pay award was approved but no provision was made for it. No amounts have been provided for some pay awards, particularly those for psychologists, despite all we have heard in the House about the urgent need for psychologists in schools and institutions. Certain costs incurred in 2001 on an ongoing basis have been treated as once-off costs only and no provision has been made in the 2002 allocation for these costs. Specific pressures on the non-pay budget, for example, insurance, energy and VAT increases, have not been recognised. There is no need for me to outline that the matters of insurance, energy and VAT are fundamental when taken into account in terms of the operation of the services at St. Raphael's. Insurance costs have become an increased burden in recent times. Notwithstanding the reply that has been prepared for the Minister of State, I ask him to implore the Minister for Health and Children to put in place the necessary resources to enable St. Raphael's to continue to provide existing services and to enhance, as was originally envisaged for the current year, what it has to offer by providing new services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue.</P>
      <P>This Government has made a significant level of additional funding available for services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism in recent years. By the end of this year, we will have provided additional revenue and capital funding amounting to nearly &euro;312 million. Within the overall revenue funding which has been provided, specific amounts have been allocated to meet identified needs in existing services and for new service developments.</P>
      <P>On foot of the changing profile of those who have been in services for many years, there is a need to review issues such as staffing levels and skill mix. For example, an increased need for additional night cover has arisen in many agencies because of the more dependent profile of the residents due to old age, illness or behavioural issues. An ongoing review process has been under way for a number of years with the health boards and voluntary agencies, with funding allocated annually in recent years to meet these identified needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant additional funding has also been allocated for the development of new services. Between 1997 and the end of this year approximately 1,700 new residential, 470 respite and 3,000 day places will have been provided. There has also been a significant enhancement of the health related support services for children with an intellectual disability or autism and the <Col N="709" /> specialist support services. Any funding for either new services or existing needs which may be made available to the health boards or the Eastern Regional Health Authority in any given year is specifically identified in the letter of determination. This funding is agreed by the Government and must be used for the purpose set out in the letter of determination. I assure the Deputy that the question of developments in respect of which funding has been provided and which have been agreed with the Department as part of a board or the authority's service plans being frozen or seriously curtailed will not arise.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of funding for organisations providing services for people with an intellectual disability or autism in the eastern region is a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The Minister understands the authority is in ongoing discussions with the St. John of God Order and other voluntary agencies in regard to its 2002 budget and he has asked the authority to keep him informed in relation to the outcome of those discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter. I raised the issue of the funding for the new community hospital in Tuam several times before in the House and on each occasion the answer was more evasive than the previous one. I hope this does not happen again tonight.</P>
      <P>A well attended public meeting in Tuam last week heard angry calls for urgent action to be taken to get the padlocks off the gates and the hospital opened. Something sinister is going on and it appears the Government is trying to hoodwink the people of Tuam and north Galway on the issue. When the Department of Health and Children funded the purchase of the existing site, it was expected that great urgency would be displayed in getting specifications, sketch plans and other details in place in order that the type, size, shape and main functions of the new hospital would be outlined in great detail and agreed between the Department and the health boards. I do not believe that indepth discussions have taken place.</P>
      <P>The fact is the procedures outlined have still not been implemented because the Western Health Board does not have a penny to pay for the specifications and sketch plans. Only recently, while under pressure in Ballinasloe, the Minister told a delegation from Tuam that he did not even have available the &euro;1 million required to do the initial specifications. He said, however, that he &ldquo;would try to find it&rdquo;. Even more curious is the fact that for &euro;6 million major work could be carried out which would allow part of the hospital to open to the public. However, there is no sign of money or a guarantee from where it will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" />As the project is not under the auspices of the national development plan, we must wait for all other projects to be funded first. If the Government was sincere in its intentions towards Tuam hospital, the money would be earmarked. It is remarkable what can be done when there is cash on the table. One needs only consider what happened with the national aquatic centre and the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i> project where money was made available in an instant.</P>
    <P>Even more curious still is the direction given, I presume by the Minister for Health and Children, to instruct officials of the Western Health Board to display the so-called artist's impression of the new hospital, even before it has been agreed what the hospital will do, when it will open, what activities it will have and, more importantly, from where the funding will come. This was a publicity stunt to keep the people of Tuam happy. If this is the case, it has certainly backfired.</P>
    <P>The Minister must produce a better answer tonight. It is imperative that the hospital opens quickly. Given some of the signals which have been emanating from both the health board and the Department of Health and Children in recent times, unless something spectacular is done to get upfront funding, the hospital may not open in the next four or five years. In fact, if the opening is delayed long enough, the strategists in both the Department of Health and Children and the health board may find a very good reason for never opening it.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that I ask the Minister to state from where the money will be earmarked to allow the hospital to open and when this will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this important issue. The provision of health services in Tuam and throughout County Galway is a matter, in the first instance, for the Western Health Board. The board has identified the need for a community hospital in Tuam. The needs assessment on which the current proposal is based relates to the population of 31,609 in the immediate catchment area, which includes Tuam and Glenamaddy. Within that population 4,432 persons, or 14%, are more than 65 years of age and in some areas this group extends to 18% of the population. Of those over 65 years, 1,059 live alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for a community hospital in Tuam is primarily underpinned by national policy which recommends such a service for every 30,000 population. The policy is being reinforced by the provision of new and upgrading of existing community nursing units and the designation of district hospitals to mirror that model of service. Generally speaking, community hospitals are not intended to have an institutional character, but rather a smaller, more homely care environment serving local communities with both out-patient and in-patient services. The case for a community <Col N="711" /> hospital in Tuam is further strengthened by the inevitable increase in population because of the town's key location as a satellite town of Galway.</P>
    <P>The needs assessment refers to the requirement for a 60 bed community hospital comprising a mix of up to 30 beds for continuing and long stay care, with the remaining 30 beds made up of direct access beds, including rehabilitation-convalescent, respite and palliative care beds. In line with what is generally provided in the board's institutions, the Tuam hospital will have a very significant multi-disciplinary mix of staff, including medical, nursing, nursing support, paramedical as well as other complementary therapists. Coupled with this, the board envisages that the hospital would be at the hub of a comprehensive outreach service providing home care programmes, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, home nursing, home help as well as other flexible packages of care. These specialist care services would, of course, be supported by social services such as community welfare and home advisory programmes.</P>
    <P>An important dimension of the Tuam community hospital would be its linkage with acute services mainly in Galway, but also in Castlebar <Col N="712" /> and Roscommon. This arrangement would enable patients to be discharged early for convalescence and would ensure that they would be only away from their families and communities for the minimum period. There would also be a close linkage with private nursing homes so as to give every resident in need of long stay care a choice as regards placement. The community hospital would open the way for the development of consultant led out-patient clinics from Galway regional hospitals and tele-imaging X-ray services could be developed.</P>
    <P>The board has established an overall management group for the development of the various services on the site. A planning group for the community hospital and the proposed day care centre has been established and has been requested to prepare the planning brief and bring the project to design stage. When this process has been completed the project will be referred to the Department of Health and Children for approval to invite tenders. At this stage it is not possible to give a precise date for the commencement of construction work at the site.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 23 April 2002.</P>

      <P>Most poultry slaughtered in Ireland is slaughtered in premises approved by the EU under the control of officials from my Department. Procedures include daily supervision of plant hygiene and ante and post mortem inspections. All poultry carcases are inspected following slaughter and those deemed unfit are condemned and removed from the food chain. A small amount of Irish poultry is processed in premises under the control of local authorities. The control of poultry production plants by my Department is carried out under contract to, and is subject to audit by, the FSAI. It is also subject to audit by the EU Commission Food and Veterinary Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poultry meat samples are collected in slaughtering plants as part of a national monitoring programme and officially tested for residues and pathogens. The national salmonella monitoring programme involves sampling, testing, hygiene controls and the destruction of infected breeding <Col N="714" /> flocks of domestic fowl where necessary. The tests provide further assurance of the quality and safety of Irish poultry products. Poultry products imported from other EU member states are subject to the same EU hygiene and safety standards that apply to Irish products. As regards products imported from non-EU countries, processing facilities in these countries must also meet EU standards and the EU Commission carries out inspections to ensure this is the case.</P>

      <P>At the request of the CJD advisory committee, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and my Department conducted a feasibility study of a targeted cull of older cattle in the context of providing additional consumer protection. The animal age groups at greatest risk of developing clinical signs of BSE were identified on the basis of currently available epidemiological information. The data were used to develop scenarios that would illustrate the range, effectiveness and efficiency of a proposed culling programme. A number of scenarios were considered including the removal of all animals born before 1998, which would require the culling of 2.07 million cattle and the removal of all animals born before 1996, which would require the culling of 1.15 million cattle. While the study did not consider the cost of a cull, at an estimated overall cost of &euro;800 per animal the total costs of the culls would be approximately &euro;1.6 billion and &euro;920 million respectively.</P>
      <P>Following on from the study, the FSAI concluded that if the Irish risk reduction measures in place to eliminate exposure of consumers to the BSE agent, including the testing of all animals over 30 months after slaughter, are fully adhered to there is no scientific basis for proposing a targeted cull of animals over an agreed age in terms of additional consumer protection. This conclusion was accepted by the CJD advisory committee. It is worth noting that despite the vastly increased levels of active surveillance, the age profile of confirmed cases has been improving since 2000. This indicates that the enhanced controls introduced in this country in 1996 are working, and that the disease should begin to work its way out of the national herd as older animals leave the system.</P>

Each farmer with commonage will be required to apply the destocking formula at individual farm level and notify my Department of the quota that must be suppressed or indeed given back for the 2003 ewe premium year. My Department will write shortly to each of the farmers involved to explain what must be done and I have instructed my officials to make every effort to simplify the procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rapid growth in employment in the past ten years has been dispersed throughout the country. While employment statistics comparing urban and rural areas are unavailable, the CSO quarterly national household survey provides information on a regional basis. Employment has risen by 48% since 1991, with an increase of 39% in the BMW region and 51% in the southern and eastern region. In 2000-01, employment growth was higher in the BMW region at 3.7% compared to 2.4% elsewhere. The strong regional spread of employment growth reflects the success of many agencies in attracting new businesses and creating employment in rural areas, as well as people's eagerness to reside in such areas. Employment <Col N="720" /> growth is reflected in the 1999-2000 CSO household budget survey, which shows a substantial increase in gross incomes across all household categories: farm, non-farm, rural and urban. The gross income of farm households increased by 40% to &euro;33,111 since the previous survey in 1994-95. Of particular note was an almost twofold increase in off-farm income among farm households. The income of other rural households rose by 50% to &euro;28,670 and urban households' gross income rose by 56% to &euro;37,661.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All rural areas have not benefited to the same extent, however. The Government committed in the PPF to establish a targeted investment programme in urban and rural disadvantaged areas. The rural strand of the programme, known as CLÁR (Ceantair Laga Árd-Riachtanais), was launched in October 2001. It is designed to tackle the problems of depopulation, decline and lack of services in the most disadvantaged rural areas. The 16 areas selected for the programme are those which have suffered the greatest population decline since 1926, with the exception of the Cooley Peninsula which has been included based on the serious difficulties caused there by foot <Col N="721" /> and mouth disease. The average population loss in these areas is 50% and 284,000 people will benefit from the programme. CLÁR's aim is to front-load NDP spending in the selected areas. An extra dedicated budget of &euro;12.7 million per annum has been allocated to ensure the programme's success in 2002 and 2003. Priority investments, as identified by the communities which will be eligible for funding will cover infrastructure, social and community services.</P>
    <P>To date measures relating to non-national roads, local improvement scheme roads, group water schemes, small public water schemes, major and minor health projects, urban and village enhancement schemes, bilingual signage schemes, top-up funding under the sport capital grants schemes and specific funding for the islands in CLÁR areas have been put in place. These measures have been agreed with the lead Departments or State agencies, as appropriate. Other funding proposals are being discussed with the relevant Departments or State agencies and it is hoped to be in a position to make an announcement on the roll-out of these programmes very shortly.</P>

      <P>One of the goals of the North-South Ministerial Council is the development of closer co-operation and joint strategies for the improvement of animal health on both sides of the border. Substantial progress has already been made in achieving this aim. At a meeting this week, the council considered and endorsed a report from the animal health steering group on co-operation on animal health issues between the Administrations. The report included updates on progress in developing closer co-operation and joint strategies for the improvement of animal health on both sides of the Border, notably with regard to internal animal movement controls, portal controls and bio-security measures on farms and agriculture related premises. I am pleased to report that a common approach has been adopted by both Administrations in relation to internal movement controls on animals and that substantial progress has been made in aligning controls applied to imports of animals and animal products by both Administrations at all points of entry into the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, joint initiatives have been taken aimed at raising the level of awareness among flock owners concerning scrapie, promoting common codes of good practice for those involved in agriculture and related industries and developing co-operation in other specific areas, including the eradication of TB, brucellosis and TSEs. In <Col N="722" /> essence, the foundations have been set for the development of an all-island animal health strategy. There is agreement in the council that a co-ordinated and complementary approach to the issue of portal controls should be further developed and maintained and the council has requested the various working groups to continue their assignments to develop closer co-operation and/or joint strategies for the improvement of animal health on both sides of the Border by 31 December 2002.</P>

      <P>A total of 128 cases of BSE have been confirmed to date. Of these, 45 cases occurred in February and 30 cases occurred in March. The following table outlines details of the counties and numbers involved.</P>
      <P>The number of confirmed cases of BSE has increased recently arising from the introduction of active surveillance conducted on fallen and casualty animals and other animals being slaughtered. Since 1 July 2001, all cattle over 30 months of age slaughtered for human consumption and all casualty and fallen animals over 24 months of age must be tested for BSE using the so-called &ldquo;rapid test&rdquo;, approved by the scientific steering committee of the European Commission. The majority of the additional cases were confirmed in fallen animals which were not intended for the human food chain.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that despite the vastly increased levels of active surveillance, BSE has not been confirmed in an animal born after October 1996. This indicates that the enhanced controls introduced in 1996 are working, and that the disease should begin to work its way out of the national herd as older animals leave the system.</P>

      <P>Detailed discussions concerning the arrangements for inspection of farms under the national beef assurance scheme have taken place over a four year period with Veterinary Ireland and its predecessor organisation. A protocol for the conduct of inspections has been agreed with Veterinary Ireland and farming representative bodies. There is universal acceptance that farm inspections should be carried out by the testing veterinary surgeon at the time of the annual herd test. There remains some resistance to the implementation of this scheme because of the supposed costs involved. In this respect, the legislation passed by the Oireachtas establishing the scheme states unambiguously that any costs incurred in securing a certificate of approval are the responsibility of the applicant. <Col N="724" /> In any event, &euro;43 million has been invested by the taxpayer in developing the cattle identification and tracing system which will underpin the beef assurance scheme.</P>
      <P>The national beef assurance scheme has been designed to assist the marketing of Irish beef by demonstrating strict implementation of high standards throughout the production chain. It provides additional assurances to consumers of Irish beef and a marketing edge for beef exports in the highly competitive and discerning European consumer markets. Ireland produces 500,000 tonnes of beef each year and the best return for farmers can be gained if the product is marketed in higher value market segments, especially the UK and continental Europe. To do so, the product must maintain a high level of consumer acceptance and confidence, particularly against a background of a sector recovering from serious difficulty. I am disappointed with Veterinary Ireland's attitude, as the organisation has continually extolled the virtues of assurance schemes while undermining the implementation of the national beef assurance scheme. I would call upon it to lend its support to the delivery of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Many measures introduced during the foot and mouth disease crisis have been discontinued, as there have been no cases of the disease in the United Kingdom since 30 September 2001. The EU has lifted all foot and mouth disease related restrictions on trade in animals and animal products from the UK and the world animal health body OIE has restored the United Kingdom's foot and mouth disease-free status. A number of measures have been retained, however, in the interests of protecting Ireland's animal health status. These include full intra-community trade and certification rules applying to trade with Northern Ireland in animals of susceptible species; restrictions on the frequency of internal livestock movements in the <Col N="725" /> interests of slowing down animal movement in order to reduce the risk of the spread of disease and enhanced controls at points of access to the State, such as ports and airports, by persons travelling from outside the island of Ireland. Disinfection measures at ports are currently under review and a range of other measures such as sheep tagging, registration of dealers, controls on sheep shearing and artificial insemination and a ban on swill remain as permanent features.</P>
      <P>Close liaison is maintained with authorities in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. Protection of the animal health status of the island of Ireland is a particular concern of the North-South Ministerial Council, the most recent meeting of which was held on 15 April. In this regard, and as jointly mandated by the North's Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Bríd Rodgers and I, an active programme of work across a range of headings and involving officials from my Department and its counterpart in Belfast is now under way. This will result in an unprecedented degree of cross-Border co-operation on animal health issues, to the benefit of all involved in agriculture in both parts of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Intensive efforts last year, culminating in a technical visit to Ireland by the Egyptian chief veterinary officer, achieved the reopening of the Egyptian market to Irish beef imports last October. Since then, the necessary requirements, including veterinary health certification, to permit the trade to resume have been agreed. The current price for Irish beef <Col N="726" /> obtaining in the UK market, strong price competition from non-EU suppliers to Egypt and weaknesses in the Egyptian economy make it difficult for Irish exporters to trade in the Egyptian market. As a result, no beef exports to Egypt have taken place during the period to which the Deputy refers. I understand that a shipment of beef to Egypt is being organised by a major exporter who, in accordance with Egyptian requirements, has requested a team of Egyptian veterinary inspectors to oversee the preparation of the consignment. Naturally, I hope this initial shipment will generate significant further business in this important market.</P>

    <P>Bord Bia's core aim is to increase sales of Irish food and drink in domestic and international <Col N="727" /> markets. This is the guiding principle for all of its programmes and activities, which are specifically tailored to the needs of the marketplace. It works closely with producers, processors and its customers in the retail and food service sectors to implement a wide range of activities in target markets. Examples of activities specifically geared towards the retail food and restaurant sector include the Féile Bia programme which has been in operation since 2000 in co-operation with the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the Irish Hotels Federation. The programme has a direct link to the Bord Bia quality assurance schemes and membership thereof is a commitment by the catering trade to use quality assured products. The programme has proved very successful to date; more than 350 hotels and restaurants have participated, a figure which is anticipated to rise to more than 500 by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The second annual consumer foods and ingredients industry day was held in September 2001. Bord Bia presented its research on trends that will influence consumer behaviour to the end of the decade. The deli futures roadshow was launched in September to herald a series of retailer briefings in the run up to the speciality foods symposium in April 2002. The purpose of these briefings is to enhance producer and retailer associations. The second international speciality foods symposium, taking place in Kinsale this week, focuses on exploring the future of speciality foods in an international forum of producers, retailers and writers and has as its overall aim the development of the Irish speciality foods sector.</P>

These provisions require potato packages to display the variety and size range of the potatoes and the registration number of the packer; they do not require a declaration of country of origin. The EU Labelling Directive and its enabling legislation is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That legislation imposes certain requirements as regards general labelling of products, including potatoes.

      <P>The initial policy when the TB scheme was introduced in 1954 was to eradicate bovine TB from cattle herds and this still remains the objective. Significant progress was made in the earlier stages of the scheme but the progress has stalled, albeit at a relatively low level of the disease. However, given the experience of the past 30 years, there is a recognition that incidence of the disease in wildlife is a major impediment and further technological advances are needed to achieve further progress. Important short-term objectives are to ensure that the incidence of the disease is reduced to the minimum level attainable so markets, particularly export markets, are not jeopardised and there is no serious threat to human health.</P>
      <P>A package of measures was agreed in the context of the PPF with the objective of reducing the incidence of TB by 50% over the four years of the programme. The numbers of reactors being disclosed has been declining since 1999 and this downward trend continued in 2001. The 2001 number of TB reactor animals, at less than 34,000, represents a decrease of 15% and 24% respectively on the corresponding figures for 2000 and 1999. The combined gross expenditure at current cost of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes, launched in 1954 and 1966 respectively, was &euro;1.275 billion up to the end of 2001, excluding administration costs. It is impossible to break down the cost of each scheme as the majority of TB and brucellosis tests are undertaken simultaneously. In assessing expenditure on the TB eradication scheme, I refer to the results of a cost benefit study undertaken in 1991 covering the period from 1954 until the establishment of ERAD in 1988. According to the study, the total quantified benefits, not including human health benefits, were estimated to amount to 7% of total cattle and milk output in 1988. The minimum benefits of the scheme were estimated to have exceeded costs by 86% and the rate of return was calculated at 15.5%. The study suggested that the scheme was highly beneficial for the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I established an independent committee in June 1999 to prepare the agriculture and food industries for the challenges and opportunities that may emerge and to make recommendations on their development over the present decade. A report, Agri-Food 2010, was completed in March 2000 and a plan of action in August 2000 set out the Government's policy response to the committee's recommendations. The plan of action contains 197 specific action points aimed at achieving a dynamic agri-food sector. It envisages an agri-food sector that offers farm families attractive and sustainable livelihood options, thus ensuring the maintenance of the maximum number on the land, has the necessary strength to compete successfully within the EU and our main third country markets, values our rural environment as the basis of thriving rural communities and is focused on meeting consumer demands, particularly for the highest standards of food safety.</P>
      <P>Of the 197 specific action points outlined in the plan, 94% are complete or have seen substantial action taken. The main instrument for the delivery of the 2010 vision is the national development plan, which provides &euro;8.5 billion for rural areas between 2000 and 2006, including just under &euro;6.1 billion for agriculture, food and related rural development. I am satisfied that the necessary policy framework, underpinned by both national and EU funding, is in place, together with appropriate monitoring and review arrangements, to ensure the optimal development of the agriculture and food industries and rural areas. It was made clear in the 2010 plan of action that the Government is fully committed to the development of a core of full-time farmers, earning viable returns on labour and capital. Most recent data available from CSO estimate that there were 87,500 full-time farmers out of a total of 143,700 in 1999. This figure is based on the number of persons reporting farming as their sole occupation.</P>

      <P>The national development plan contains indicative public funding of &euro;358 million for a full range of support measures for the development of the food industry. The provisions have been designed specifically to enhance the industry's competitiveness and innovative capability while ensuring that development is underpinned by attention to food safety and consumer demands. My Department and the development agencies are administering the initiatives. Funding has been allocated for: capital investment, &euro;152 million; in-company research, &euro;36 million; institutional research, &euro;70 million; <Col N="730" /> marketing and promotion, &euro;61 million; and human resources development, &euro;39 million.</P>
      <P>All the measures are now operational and approvals and expenditure are broadly on target. Up to the end of 2001, almost &euro;71.73 million had been awarded under the various measures with awards of &euro;23 million being made under the capital investment and institutional research measures. The package which, on full implementation, is expected to help increase sales by &euro;2.6 billion by the end of 2006, represents a comprehensive response to the development needs of the industry as identified by the food industry development group and the agri-food committee. This comprehensive strategy for the development of the industry over the coming years places emphasis on added value, market orientation and competitiveness and will continue to build upon the integrated approach adopted under the food sub-programme 1994-99. I am confident these initiatives will assist the food industry to meet future opportunities and challenges and allow them to avail of the substantial growth opportunities that exist in this industry, both in the home and export markets.</P>

      <P>The future of a company is a matter for the company concerned and, where appropriate, the industrial develop<Col N="731" /> ment agencies and is not one in which I have a direct function. I am informed by Enterprise Ireland, the State agency of my Department with responsibility for indigenous industry, that a receiver was been appointed to the seafood processing company Red Sail Limited from 10 January 2002. The issue of securing a purchaser for the company's assets is in the hands of the receiver. Enterprise Ireland has had ongoing contact with the receiver and has provided him with details of potential investors in the company. In this regard, Enterprise Ireland has been advised that tender sale documents were issued to prospective buyers last week. The final date for receipt of offers is 2 May and it will take a further two weeks for offers to be considered by the receiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland believes the value added seafood sector offers significant industrial development opportunities and it is actively promoting and supporting growth in this sector. As part of its strategy for developing industry in County Louth, Enterprise Ireland has focused on the knowledge, information, communications and telecommunications sectors for development in the county and is making efforts to encourage the community to develop a suitable high-spec community enterprise centre in Drogheda to accommodate ICT based projects. For its part, IDA Ireland is actively promoting County Louth for foreign direct investment and is about to embark on the development of a new 63 acre business park in Drogheda to enhance the town's attractiveness for new business. The agency hopes to seek a developer to provide the first of a number <Col N="732" /> of marketable buildings in the park by the end of the year. In addition, IDA Ireland is about to seek planning permission for a number of factories and offices in Finnabair Business Park in Dundalk.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Since this issue arose at the Barcelona European Council, work has proceeded on drafting a declaration confirming that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is unaffected by the treaties. The draft declaration will be a matter for the incoming Government to consider, as will the progress of consultations in pursuit of it with our EU partners. These consultations would take place in the context of the welcome at the Barcelona European Council for the approach outlined by the Taoiseach, and the Council's willingness to contribute in every possible way to supporting the Government.</P>
      <P>As has been previously made clear, the declaration will form part of the Government's overall strategy of addressing the factors which lay behind the defeat of the Nice treaty referendum. Steps have also been taken to provide for better Oireachtas scrutiny of EU matters and, through the Forum on Europe, to have a national debate on &ldquo;issues relevant to Ireland's membership of an enlarging Union and to consider the range of topics arising in the context of the debate on the future of Europe&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach visited Brazil and Argentina between 17 and 24 July 2001. The main objective of the visits was to develop political and economic relations with the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and Argentina have maintained diplomatic relations for more than half a century. During his visit, the Taoiseach held meetings with the then President of Argentina, Dr. Fernando de la Rúa, the Mayor of Buenos Aires, Dr. Aníbal Ibarra, as well as the Vice-President of the <Col N="736" /> Supreme Court, Mr. Eduardo Moliné O'Connor. The Taoiseach made two key note addresses in Argentina: the first to members of the National Council for International Relations &ndash; CARI &ndash; in Buenos Aires, whom he addressed on the theme of partnership, embracing, <i>inter alia</i>, the Northern Ireland peace process and the second to a group of business leaders on Ireland's economic development. Enterprise Ireland and Bord Fáilte were closely involved in the visit.</P>
    <P>Argentina is also home to the largest community of Irish origin outside the English speaking world. Irish-Argentines have made an outstanding contribution to their adoptive country since the days of its struggle for independence. The Argentine navy was founded by Admiral William Brown from Foxford and, during his visit, the Taoiseach laid a wreath at a monument erected in his memory. It is estimated that there are some half a million Argentines of Irish origin, and there are numerous Irish-Argentine clubs and societies. The Taoiseach addressed a representative group at a reception in his honour at one of the several educational establishments in Buenos Aires under Irish auspices.</P>

      <P>On 17 January, I authorised my Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations for the purchase of three S92 medium range helicopters for search and rescue purposes. The negotiations were to include an option exercisable within three years by the Department for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport. The time frame proposed by Sikorsky would see the delivery of three search and rescue helicopters by the end of next year. Following my decision of 17 January, another companies involved in the competition, Eurocopter, instituted judicial review proceedings, contesting the decision to open negotiations with Sikorsky. The matter was up for mention in the High Court last Monday, 15 April, but was adjourned with the consent of all parties to Monday, 13 May. A comprehensive training package will be provided to cover the provision of the new helicopters. Interim arrangements which have to be made for helicopters are the subject of ongoing discussions between my <Col N="738" /> Department and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

    <P>Notional dairy cows are obtained by dividing a producer's milk quota in respect of a given calendar year by the national average yield per cow for that year, or by the recorded average milk yield per cow where the producer is in an official milk recording scheme. EU regulations governing the schemes specifically provide that animals applied on in excess of the individual's herdowners permitted stocking rate of two livestock units per hectare are deemed to be paid under the age category applied for. The application for special beef premium is stocking density exceeded and therefore the 11 animals applied for are deemed paid in the age category under which they are applied for. No payment can issue on this application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Based on the most recent statistics available, the United Kingdom, Russia, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Portugal and Cyprus are the top ten markets for Irish beef. It is my policy and that of the Government that everything possible should be done to ensure that Irish livestock and meat producers have unrestricted access to all our important markets worldwide and no effort is being spared to bring this about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, beef exports to European Union and third country markets were <Col N="740" /> adversely affected by the BSE crisis in late 2000. While no BSE related restrictions on Irish beef or beef products have been imposed by the EU Commission or any EU member states, loss of consumer confidence in beef led to reduced beef consumption in mainland Europe. While exports to continental markets fell substantially during that year, I am happy to say the decline has been offset by increased beef exports to the United Kingdom. Exports to this market in 2001 were about double the levels achieved in 2000 and the indications are that this level of trade will continue for the foreseeable future. That beef consumption in the EU is steadily recovering from the serious collapse which took place is due to a restoration of confidence in the product as a result of measures taken at EU level. The market support measures which were put in place to deal with the overhang of product on the market have also had a useful effect in helping to restore balance. All of this will help Ireland's efforts to regain our former levels of sales to the markets in question.</P>
    <P>Political, diplomatic and technical efforts are continuing to secure the reopening of important third country markets, most of which were closed following the BSE crisis last year. The Russian market for Irish beef, which was closed following the foot and mouth disease crisis, re-opened last year. Intensive efforts last year, culminating in a technical visit to Ireland by the Egyptian chief veterinary officer, achieved the reopening of the Egyptian market to Irish beef imports last October. Since then, the necessary requirements, including veterinary health certification, to permit the trade to resume have been agreed. The current price for Irish beef obtaining in the UK market, strong price competition from non-EU suppliers to Egypt and weaknesses in the Egyptian economy make it difficult for Irish exporters to trade in the Egyptian market. As a result, no beef exports to Egypt have taken place during the period to which the Deputy refers. I understand that a shipment of beef to Egypt is being organised by a major exporter who, in accordance with Egyptian requirements, has requested a team of Egyptian veterinary inspectors to oversee the preparation of the consignment. Naturally, I hope that this initial shipment will generate significant further business in this important market.</P>
    <P>My Department, along with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia, is working intensively to outline to the authorities in important third country markets the positive results of our handling of the BSE crisis and the food safety guarantees we can offer to consumers of Irish beef. Particular attention is focused on the Gulf region, which is a significant market for our beef. A senior veterinary official from my Department visited the region last year to brief the authorities there on our BSE problem. Our ambassador to Saudi Arabia has kept in close contact with the authorities in the region and countries have been invited to send technical delegations to Ireland to assess the quality of our beef production and the <Col N="741" /> efficacy of our BSE controls. Senior officials from my Department will be visiting the Gulf region next week to press our case. Similar invitations to send technical delegations have also issued to South Africa, Algeria, Indonesia and the Philippines. Intensive contact is being maintained with these countries with a view to advancing our case for re-opening the markets. I have visited South Africa and have offered to send high level teams from my Department to brief their counterparts in these markets if this is required at any time.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department. Changing lifestyles and increased disposable income are having an effect in increasing household expenditure on food and are driving a sustained expansion in the food service sector. This is borne out by the results of the CSO household budget survey for 2000, which shows that between 1995 and 2000 average weekly household expenditure on food increased by 31% while expenditure on meals away from home increased by approximately 150%.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 20 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. An advance payment issued on 17 December 2001 for 16 animals as at that time four animal tag numbers were under query. In processing the application for balance payment, it was found that the four animals were disposed of inside the six months retention period and only one animal was replaced in accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme. The herd owner was informed on the 22 March 2002 that three animals were being rejected from the application and a reduction penalty would be applied to the remaining eligible animals. On this basis, the full entitlement due is less than the amount of the advance already paid resulting in an overpayment. The person named has been informed that he can appeal his case by contacting the headage and premia appeals unit of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 to 69, inclusive, and No. 71.</P>
      <P>The capital grant scheme operated by my Department for the marketing and processing of agricultural products applies to projects at or near farm level in the horticulture, potato, eggs, grain and livestock marketing and processing sectors which do not fall within the remit of the development agencies or are not covered by the Department's on farm schemes. Because the funding under the scheme is limited, eligibility alone does not necessarily confer an entitlement to grant aid and generally applications are required to undergo a competitive assessment and selection process. The first call for applications under this scheme was made last year with a closing date of 14 September. In the potato sector the total number of applications received by that date was 28. Two of these were found to be ineligible while a third was subsequently withdrawn leaving a total of 25 applications to be considered.</P>
      <P>In cases where a project requires planning permission, it is not a condition of the scheme that this be obtained prior to submission of the application. Applicants are required to provide proof of lodgement of an application for planning permission and, of course, receipt of such permission is a prerequisite for the award of aid. Five of the projects referred to did not require planning permission and in the case of the remaining 20 the conditions which I have outlined were complied with fully. With one exception, all of the applicants were required to provide additional information for the purposes of clarifying various elements of their applications. In all cases it was considered that the initial and supplementary information provided was sufficient to facilitate assessment and evaluation of the applications without the need for on farm inspections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" />Between them, the 25 applications in the potato sector had a grant aid requirement of almost &euro;10 million, while the funding available amounted to &euro;2.1 million. The applications were evaluated by reference to viability, target markets, their sectoral and regional impacts, particularly at primary producer level, and the extent to which they would improve the saleability of the primary product. Following the assessment process six projects, involving grant aid of <Col N="754" />&euro;1,796,125, were recommended to me and I approved them. I expect to receive a further recommendation shortly regarding the unallocated balance of approximately &euro;308,000.</P>
    <P>Details of the six projects for which aid has been awarded, broken down by region, are set out in the following table 1. Four of the successful applicants received grant aid under previous funding rounds and full details of the projects and amounts involved are set out in table 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not undertaken any formal examination of the impact on rural development of objections to planning applications in rural areas. In so far as one-off rural housing is concerned, my views are already known. Government policy on rural development is set out in the white paper published in August 1999. As a result the Government is committed to ensuring the economic and social well being of rural communities and providing the conditions for a meaningful fulfilling life for all people living in rural areas. The aim is that there will be vibrant and sustainable communities able to enjoy a standard of living and quality of life which will make them attractive communities in which to live and work and where individuals and families will have a real choice as to whether to stay in, leave or move to, rural Ireland, whether in farming or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Rural communities should also be able to enjoy access to education, training and lifelong learning and an adequate level of social and other services and infrastructures. Their cultural identities, in particular the language, traditions, heritage and sense of community must be valued and retained. The national development plan is the vehicle on which the policies in the white paper are being progressed. This involves expenditure on a wide range of measures from agriculture to training and employment and infrastructure, including housing and health services, as well as the Leader programme on rural development. As further evidence of the Government's commitment to rural areas, I am currently implementing the CLÁR programme which aims to fast track NDP expenditure in the most disadvantaged rural communities. To underpin the success of the programme, I am allocating an additional &euro;12.7 million, both this year and next, towards the various measures. Those which I have announced to date cover non-national roads, LIS roads, group water schemes, small public water schemes, urban enhancement scheme, village enhancement scheme, bilingual signage scheme, and sports capital grant scheme. I will make further announcements in due course in relation to other proposals I am currently considering for inclusion in the CLÁR programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the assumption that the question relates to &ldquo;equity release&rdquo; plans which are arranged by financial institutions for elderly home owners who wish to <Col N="757" /> realise some of the value in their homes while continuing to remain in occupation, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no specific legislation governing such equity release arrangements. However, the general position regarding capital gains tax and income tax implications of such an arrangement is as follows.</P>
      <P>A typical example would be where a capital sum is obtained by a home owner through a mortgage arrangement with a financial institution. The institution grants a mortgage of, say, 25% of the value of the property which is then available to the home owner to deal with as he or she wishes. Under the arrangement, the interest falling due on the capital sum is payable by the home owner but rolled-up by the financial institution. On the death of the individual, the total amount outstanding, that is mortgage amount and accumulated interest, would be recouped by the financial institution from the estate of the individual through the charge on the property. In such circumstances, the capital payment received by the home owner is not liable to income tax or capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>Where a capital sum is received under an arrangement which would involve a change of ownership of the property, and where the home owner retains a right of residence, there is no income tax liability involved and no liability to capital gains tax in circumstances where the property had been the principal private residence of the individual during his or her period of ownership. Where under an equity release arrangement, regular income payments, as distinct from capital payments, are received by the home owner these income payments are liable to income tax in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Civil Service, for which I have direct responsibility, as in the public service generally, superannuation schemes are generally financed on a pay as you go basis and accordingly there is no fund and, hence, there are no employer contributions as such. The normal practice is that the moneys for paying the relevant pensioners are provided for each year in voted moneys, in the case of civil <Col N="758" /> servants, the Vote for Superannuation and Retired Allowances.</P>
      <P>As regards contributions, financing and funding in the wider public sector, including the commercial State-sponsored bodies, I am aware that a variety of arrangements apply. These are a matter in the first instance for the individual bodies concerned. As regards pension increases in the civil and public service, the position is that, prior to 1969, pensions in payment were increased from time to time on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. In the 1969 budget, the Minister for Finance announced his decision in principle to adopt pay parity and to move towards it over a number of years. In the 1984 budget, full parity, that is revision of pensions from the same date as the relevant pay increases, was introduced for general pay increases. In the 1986 budget, full parity was introduced for grade and special pay increases. In the wider public sector pension increases are a matter in the first instance for the authority directly controlling the pension scheme in question.</P>

      <P>The guidelines for the recruitment and selection of students for the nursing registration and diploma programme provides that meals will be available to students on a seven day per week basis without charge in designated health board and hospital restaurants. It is the responsibility of each health board to implement these guidelines within their functional area.

Therefore, there was funding in the health board or hospital base allocations to meet part of the costs of providing meals to the students on the nursing registration or diploma programmes. Prior to the commencement of the diploma programmes, the health boards and hospitals agreed to meet the remainder of the costs themselves.</P>
      <P>I understand from the South Eastern Health Board that nursing students are provided with free meals. They are provided with swipe cards for the canteen, allowing them to avail of the meals. The system is a checking system and does not inhibit the choice or quantity of food obtained by the students. The board believes this is the most efficient method of ensuring that student nurses receive the meals to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand some of the schools of nursing have entered into a local arrangement to provide a cash or voucher alternative to the provision of meals within their existing resources. My Department has no objection to such arrangements provided that the agreement of the nursing students and the relevant nursing unions is obtained. The South Eastern Health Board acknowledges that psychiatric student nurses in its area receive an allowance in lieu of free meals. This is due to the fact that these students do not have regular access <Col N="760" /> to canteen facilities within psychiatric hospitals by the nature of their training locations.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board was informed by the INO of its intention to proceed with student demonstrations at Waterford Regional Hospital on 12 February 2002. The board put together a substantial financial package to resolve the issue and made two offers to the students on 28 March 2002. The board regrets that both offers were not accepted, is now considering whether a revised offer can be made and is involved in ongoing discussions with the INO representative and the management in Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is administered by the health boards on behalf of my <Col N="761" /> Department. Current departmental policy states that DCA should be paid in respect of eligible children from the date of application up to the age of 16 years whose disability is so severe that they require constant care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant health board to decide whether a child qualifies for DCA.</P>
      <P>A national health board working group is currently examining all the disability related allowances and grants which come under the aegis of my Department, including domiciliary care allowance. As part of its work, the group is examining procedures which may require standardisation across all health boards. When the group has finalised its report, its recommendations will be considered in consultation with the Department of Finance and in the context of the many competing demands for resources within the health sector.</P>

      <P>Since mid-1997 more than &euro;171.45 million, £135 million, additional revenue funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of the child welfare and protection services. This has provided for a wide range of developments including alternative care services such as community and family support projects and preventive services, including the &ldquo;Edge&rdquo; project, a community based service in County Mayo which is specifically for young people who may otherwise require specialised residential care. The Government's commitment to tackling the problems of social exclusion in this area was underlined by the launch of the National Children's Strategy in November 2000 and the passing of the Children Act, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital investment of approximately &euro;38.09 million, £30 million, is being made available by this Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or foster care services. I have been informed by the health boards that the number of high support and special care places <Col N="764" /> and individual high support packages identified by health boards for children with special needs has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 94, of which 62 are currently occupied.

    <P>An additional 41 high support and special care places are planned. The eastern region high support facility, providing 24 places at Portrane, is nearing completion. The Midland Health Board, North Eastern Health Board, North Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus in Castleblaney. The Mid-Western Health Board will provide five special care places for adolescent boys on behalf of the Southern Region, that is the Mid-Western Health Board, Southern Health Board, and South Eastern Health Board, in a purpose built facility which is nearing completion. Places in these facilities are due to become available by mid-2002. In addition, my Department has been informed by the Western Health Board that it is currently considering the redesignation of one of its children's residential centres in Galway to accommodate children with behavioural problems and to facilitate engagement in therapeutic programmes of care. It is expected that six places will be available.</P>
    <P>While health boards have experienced some difficulties in recruiting suitably trained staff, pro<Col N="765" /> gress has been made in this area through recruitment abroad and the expansion of training courses. In particular, the South Western Area Health Board, which has operational responsibility for the Ballydowd special care unit, is involved in an ongoing intensive recruitment campaign to address staffing levels. As the Deputy will be aware, a new career and pay structure for child care workers was introduced last year which aims to ensure that more people are attracted into child care and that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level. The issue of special residential places will be kept under ongoing review by the Special Residential Services Board.</P>

      <P>I am aware of shortages of social workers in the child welfare and protection services at present which are impacting particularly in certain health boards. A number of important initiatives designed to improve recruitment and retention of social work personnel are currently under way, both at national and individual health board level, in order to alleviate staffing pressures. A national social work forum has been established to progress a number of key issues for the social work profession arising from the recommendations included in the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000. Major developments include the creation of a new grade of senior social work practitioner and the upgrading of single handed and certain specialised posts. A caseload management study is also being carried out by an independent consultant and this is expected to facilitate maximising the contribution of scarce social work skills and expertise within the health service at present. In relation to training, a further 51 training places will be provided in 2002, bringing the total number of training places to 188 this year, an increase of 82 over the level of provision two years ago. It is envisaged that a further 28 training places will be provided in 2003. A national network of practice placement co-ordinators is also planned to facilitate the provision of high quality practice placements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, particular difficulties arise in the ERHA area in filling posts working in city centre areas, areas of social and economic deprivation and those areas proximate to other health boards. A number of recruitment initiatives are under way in the ERHA area to address the high number of current vacancies including recruitment from overseas. In addition, the ERHA has adopted a proactive approach to the utilisation and deployment of social work staff by such measures as employing access workers to assist with access visits between chil<Col N="766" /> dren and families, deploying non-social work posts such as community child care workers, family support workers and administrative support where possible and establishing a management, staff, union group to review the role of social work personnel with a view to establishing what duties can be performed appropriately by other disciplines and how the social worker can be better assisted in delivering important services.</P>
    <P>Regional health boards are also engaged in a number of strategies to attenuate the impact of staff shortages in child welfare and protection services. These include organising regular recruitment campaigns, both in Ireland and abroad; putting in place structures that provide support and supervision for staff; and the development of appropriate staff training policies. I am continuing to keep arrangements regarding the adequacy of social work services in the child welfare and protection services under close review.</P>

      <P>The work of the expert group on the development of radiotherapy services is at an advanced stage and the provision of additional services for radiotherapy treatment will be considered in the context of its report. I have been advised that all health boards have been afforded the opportunity to meet with the group. Because of the importance and the complexity of the work, it is not possible to give an exact date for the report of the expert group but it is anticipated its work will be completed in the near future.</P>

      <P>Prioritising and provision of funding for drug misuse services is the responsibility of health boards. I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that no health board is at present providing funding to the drug rehabilitation centre referred to by the Deputy. I am aware that capital funding has been agreed in principle by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, subject <Col N="767" /> to certain conditions being met. These include the normal conditions attaching to this capital scheme, such as planning approval, where appropriate, certification that all technical requirements, such as safety, are met and all other relevant information is provided to the agency channelling the funding to the approved project. The Northern Area Health Board has been approached to act as the channel of funding in this instance. The national drug strategy team, in consultation with the health board, is drawing up the detailed conditions of funding.</P>

      <P>Under the ophthalmic schemes operated by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, adult medical card holders, which now includes all persons over the age of 70 years, are entitled to free eye sight testing and free prescription spectacles where these are found to be necessary. Practitioners who have a contract either with a health board or with the Eastern Regional Health Authority are paid in accordance with an agreed scale of charges. Currently, practitioners are paid a fee of &euro;18.86 in respect of a routine sight test and &euro;42.22 for either reading or distant vision spectacles and &euro;84.13 for bifocal spectacles. These spectacles are supplied from an approved range of frames. Where a medical card holder requires a medical eye examination or other prescription items, such as tints, prisms or spheres, these will also be provided free of charge under the schemes. If a medical card holder decides to waive their medical card entitlement and obtains any services from an optician in a private capacity, all costs incurred for such services, are a matter between the patient and the optician and are not funded under the terms of the schemes.</P>

      <P>My Department's circular letter, PD 3/94, dated 21 July 1994 to planning authorities dealt with planning aspects <Col N="769" /> relating to the use of proprietary waste water treatment systems, for the disposal of sewage from domestic dwellings. Proprietary sewage disposal systems are usually certified by the National Standards Authority of Ireland or Irish Agrément Board. Circular letter PD 3/94 indicated that proprietary treatment systems generally, and particularly those with Agrément certification, will, if operated and maintained properly, deliver effluents to a consistently high quality.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each planning authority to assess, on the merits of each individual case, whether or not a particular site is suitable for on-site disposal of effluent. Having decided in principle that a site is suitable for on-site disposal of effluent, it is a matter for the planning authority to attach the appropriate conditions to the relevant planning permission, having regard to the type of waste water treatment system under consideration, that is, septic tank proprietary system. As with planning conditions generally, follow-up action to ensure compliance with such a condition is a matter for each planning authority concerned.</P>

I do not consider that any action <Col N="773" /> by my Department would be appropriate in relation to the performance by the local authority of its functions in this case. The current procedures for local authority boundary alterations are set out in Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991, and associated regulations and require initiation by a local authority concerned. Before submitting a formal application to my Department, the proposing authority must invite submissions from the other local authority affected, and from the general public. Any order made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government altering the boundary of any county or city requires the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The licensing of a discharge to waters, together with general enforcement action for the protection and improvement of water quality, is a matter for the relevant local authority, in this case Clare County Council. These functions are performed by local authorities under the general supervision of the EPA. My Department has no supervisory role in relation to these matters and consequently would not be in a receipt of recent reports from companies in relation to their water borne discharges.</P>
      <P>I understand from Clare County Council that Aer Rianta has been asked by the council to connect certain discharges from Shannon Airport to the Shannon town system rather than to provide a separate system for the airport alone. Discussions are under way between the council and Shannon Development regarding the taking over by the council of the water and sewerage services in Shannon town. I also understand that, subject to the outcome of these discussions, the council hopes to be in a position in the near future to connect discharges from Shannon Airport to the sewage treatment facilities in Shannon town.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the early conclusion of these discussions, I have allocated funding in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme, 2002-2004, to allow upgrading works, with an estimated cost of &euro;8.88 million, on the Shannon town sewerage scheme. Clare County Council has submitted a revised brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare a preliminary report for this scheme and a decision will be made on it on receipt of further information, which has been requested from the county council.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was introduced to provide income support for less well-off students who were disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allows students to take up part-time work in the community and to receive payment for this work.</P>
      <P>While the level of projects on offer under the scheme has remained high over the past number of years, there has been a significant drop in student interest in the scheme. This is due to the wider availability of summer jobs and is a welcome trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" />The scheme was introduced to assist students in less well-off families at a time where the availability of alternative opportunities for students was much less than it is today and there would be no justification for widening eligibility for the scheme in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>To qualify for participation in the scheme, students must satisfy a means test which is similar to the means test which applies to applicants for unemployment assistance. This is appropriate in that the scheme is intended to replace unemployment assistance for those concerned.</P>
      <P>It is not possible, in the time available, to estimate the cost of changing the means test specifically for the students scheme as suggested. A total of &euro;3.8 million has been provided in the Estimates of my Department for the scheme this year.</P>

      <Quest>the reason no funds were made available for a new swimming pool at Dundrum family recreation centre in his recent announcement of grants for sports clubs; if his attention has been drawn to the dilapidated condition of the current facilities at the centre; if he will make funding available in 2002 as requested; and his views on whether a new swimming pool facility is badly needed for use by the local community and cannot be provided without State funding.</Quest>

      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract document, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</P>
      <P>The proposed swimming pool at the Dundrum family recreation centre is one of 46 applications on hands in the current swimming pool programme. These applications are at various stages of progress. A preliminary report has been submitted by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for the replacement of the pool in question. My Department has requested further information from the council in connection with this proposal. The application will be considered further on receipt of this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding which applications are to be funded under the programme, my Department gives consideration to such matters as the need for a swimming pool in an area; suitability of the proposed site; future viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues; construction and operating standards of existing facilities; a satisfactory financial plan; and the <Col N="783" /> need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds.</P>
    <P>The recent grant allocations referred to by the Deputy were made under the 2002 sports capital programme, which is a separate scheme to the local authority swimming pool programme under which the Dundrum pool proposal is being considered.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the accommodation provided for persons with dyslexia sitting the leaving certificate; the manner in which this accommodation is dealt with by the Central Applications Office in the context of offers for third level college places; and his views on the availability of accommodation at third level colleges for persons with dyslexia when undertaking examinations.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a scheme of reasonable accommodations for candidates with special needs at the certificate examinations. The range of reasonable accommodations in place includes the use of readers, scribes, tape-recorders and the use of computer technology in certain cases. It is also possible for a special needs candidate to be granted an exemption from the assessment of spelling and grammar in language subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When applying for a third level place a student can either apply through the standard or non-<Col N="784" /> standard entry routes. When a student pursues the standard entry route <i>via</i> the Central Applications Office they are invited to indicate on the application form if they have a difficulty with either a medical/physical condition/specific learning disability which they believe should be brought to the attention of the relevant higher education institution. When a student indicates that they have such a difficulty the CAO will contact the student for further details, which they will then supply to the institution concerned. In this regard, I understand that most colleges will consider applications from students with dyslexia seeking an exemption on a third language requirement.</P>
    <P>The non-standard route involves direct application by the student to the institution in question with individual assessment of each application. In some cases, forms of assessment other than the leaving certificate are used and applicants may be invited for an interview. The report of the commission on the points system supports these arrangements and recommends that each third level institution should set aside a number of places for students with physical and learning disabilities.</P>
    <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education sets out a comprehensive framework to increase participation in third level education by disadvantaged students, mature students and students with disabilities. The report makes a number of recommendations in relation to students with disabilities with the aim of ensuring a smooth transition from second level to third level. Implementation of these recommendations is under consideration within my Department in the context of available resources.</P>
    <P>The availability of accommodations for examinations at third level is a matter for each individual institution concerned. I understand that a range of supports may be available in institutions to support students with disabilities when they enrol in the institution including special examination facilities for candidates with specific learning difficulties. The Association for Higher Education Access and Disability, which receives funding from my Department through the Higher Education Authority, has issued a detailed guide for third level institutions regarding examination arrangements for students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The special fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by my Department, assists students who have special needs in attending third level institutions. The purpose of the fund is to provide grant assistance to students towards the cost of special equipment, including computers, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. Applications for assistance under the fund are forwarded to my Department at the beginning of the academic year. In 2001, allocations totalling &euro;2,619,470 were made to 809 students pursuing courses in the academic year 2001-02.</P>
    <P>Since 1996 the Higher Education Authority has <Col N="785" /> been providing funding under its targeted initiative scheme for a range of measures designed to facilitate students with disabilities. The amount allocated for such measures in 2001 was &euro;1.2 million. In the area of dyslexia, measures funded include learning support tutors, dyslexia support officers, orientation programmes for students with disabilities, provision of assistive software and student spelling support services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 136 and 152 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department held discussions with the representatives of the managerial authorities in the second level sector in order to ensure that schools would remain open when the ASTI directive to its members to withdraw from voluntary supervision and substitution duties took effect on the 4 March 2002. Contingency <Col N="786" /> arrangements were drawn up by the representative management groups, the Joint Managerial Body, the Irish Vocational Education Association and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools following detailed discussions with officials of my Department. As part of the contingency arrangements, my Department undertook to resource schools in order that they could employ staff to provide supervision and thereby remain open. In addition, my Department undertook to recoup the cost to the management authorities in advertising for, recruiting and training personnel to provide supervision services in schools on a temporary contractual basis and to operate a telephone help-line for schools. The sum of &euro;163,981 has been recouped to the JMB to offset the cost of providing these services to date.</P>
    <P>Supervisors who contracted for delivery of supervision services are being remunerated at a daily contract rate of &euro;68.56, based on a minimum of two hours' supervision. Where further supervision above these two hours is required, this is being remunerated at &euro;34.28 per additional hour. This is the equivalent to the hourly rate offered to teachers.</P>
    <P>For purposes of the contingency arrangements, payments have been made to schools by my Department, calculated on the basis of &euro;1,270 per whole time equivalent teacher post per annum. In addition, funding has also been provided to cover employers' PRSI and holiday pay. Under the contingency arrangements a payment amounting to 5% of supervision costs is being provided to schools to pay for additional support, including secretarial assistance. In aggregate, the sum disbursed to schools amounts to some &euro;12 million, which equates to 12 weeks calculated in accordance with the above formula. The contingency plan acknowledges that supplementary allocations may need to be made to some schools at a later stage if their approved outgoings are greater than the amount of the grant. Accordingly, the final costs are not available.</P>
    <P>The contingency plan, by its nature, is flexible and does not specify a pupil-supervisor ratio. As it is recognised that the number of supervisors required would vary from school to school depending on local circumstances including layout, both internal and external, it is considered that individual school management authorities are best placed to assess the level of cover and the number of persons required on an ongoing basis. Responsibility accordingly for the making of appointments is a matter for school authorities. Information concerning the number of supervisors recruited by schools in each county, the number of hours worked per supervisor and the average payment to each supervisor is not available to my Department.</P>

This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a <Col N="788" /> record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>

      <P>The school in question is a special school which caters for emotionally disturbed pupils of primary school going age. The staffing consists of a principal and six assistant teachers with the support of ten special needs assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term emotional disturbance includes pupils with behavioural and conduct disorders as well as those with emotional disturbance. These children <Col N="789" /> are treated by a psychiatrist or psychologist for conditions such as neurosis, childhood psychosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder.</P>
    <P>The development plan for the national educational psychological service agency envisages that at least six educational psychologists will be appointed to counties Carlow and Kilkenny. The current establishment is 1.5 psychologists. It is not possible at present to include the school attended by the named pupil in the list of those served by NEPS.</P>
    <P>However, I am fully aware of the concern being felt by schools and parents who require psychological support before NEPS can extend to include their areas. Last summer I therefore announced an initiative whereby funding is being made available to schools to purchase assessment services from suitably qualified private psychologists. This scheme is known as the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. Details of this scheme were circulated to all schools and are also available on my Department's website.</P>
    <P>The school mentioned by the Deputy may avail of this scheme and NEPS will bear the cost of the assessment.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme, operated by the local authorities under the aegis of my Department, offers financial support to eligible students attending approved third level courses. Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</P>
      <P>Under the nationality clause of the higher education grants scheme a candidate must hold EU nationality, have official refugee status or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State. Candidates must meet the nationality requirement of the scheme at the time of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme re-entering means entering as a mature student following a break of at least one year and having previously attended an undergraduate or postgraduate course approved for the purposes of the higher education grant schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department understands the student, to whom the Deputy refers, commenced her third level course in the 2001-2002 academic year but was not granted Irish citizenship until March 2002. Accordingly, she did not meet the nationality requirement of the 2001 higher education grant scheme at the time she commenced her course.</P>
      <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the schemes in individual cases. However, I have asked my officials to examine the issues arising in this case, in the context of its review of the maintenance grants schemes for the 2002-03 academic year.</P>

      <P>My Department has statutory responsibility for the provision of residential places for children up to the age of 16 years who are referred by the courts. There are five young offender centres under the aegis of my Department and they currently provide residential accommodation for up to 162 children, this includes up to 31 remand places. The current operational capacity is 132 places. The following table provides a breakdown of these places.</P>
      <P>The operational capacity of these centres will fluctuate from time to time for a variety of reasons. The capacity of the Finglas centre is reduced currently to facilitate refurbishment and new developments. Capacity may also be reduced where a centre is required to make special arrangements in order to cater for a particularly difficult child.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently implementing a major capital development plan in the young offender centres to ensure that the centres meet obligations that will arise under the Children Act, 2001, in addition to ensuring that they meet modern child care and health and safety standards. The projected capacity at the end of this plan is 181 children.</P>
      <P>My Department has commissioned an independent review of the residential requirements for young offenders. The purpose of this review is to ensure that there are sufficient residential places available to meet the needs of the target group in the short, medium and longer term. A consultant has been appointed and it is expected that his report will be available shortly. The outcome of this review will inform future development plans in this area.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to children at risk is evidenced by the measures in the Children Act, 2001. It proposes a modern statutory framework for the development of the juvenile justice system. In addition to updating the provisions relating to young persons who have been sentenced by the courts, including the obligations of the centres under the aegis of my Department, the legislation will provide for a wide range of early interventions and non-custodial alternatives to cater for children coming into conflict with the law or with serious care needs. It also provides for the establishment of the special residential services board. The special residential services board, currently operating on an administrative basis, will work in close so-operation with all relevant bodies, to facilitate and ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to children in respect of whom children detention orders or special care orders are made.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the independent inspection of the Finglas Children's Centre being carried out by Mr. M. Laxton, who is an internationally recognised expert in the field of residential child care. The inspector has been meeting with centre management, staff and children resident in the centre in the course of the inspection. In addition, he has access to my Department's files on the centre and files held by the centre itself including those relating to personnel-staffing issues. This is an independent inspection and, it would be inappropriate for me to try and direct the inspector to conduct the inspection in a particular manner. However, it is open to the inspector to meet with and interview any staff member of the centre and others, including former staff, where he considers this necessary and appropriate to the satisfactory completion of the inspection process.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's interest in this centre and to reiterate my invitation to her to meet the inspector if there are concerns that she wishes to bring to his attention.</P>

      <P>I met the three teacher unions on 28 February 2002. I indicated that the Government is not opposed to the pensionability of supervision payments. In that regard I offered to enter into a process at the end of the current school year to work out the details of an arrangement which would be consistent with the requirements for pensionability. I also indicated that the procedures provided by the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers should be used to deal with the issue of an appropriate payment rate for supervision. These procedures include independent arbitration where the parties cannot agree.</P>
      <P>My approach was welcomed by the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Teachers' Union of Ireland but rejected by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland. The ASTI central executive has since decided not to enter into any further negotiations on this matter pending the settlement of its pay claim.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the teachers' conciliation council on 12 March the TUI and INTO requested that further discussions take place on the issue of supervision and substitution. These discussions have commenced with the assistance of a facilitator. The ASTI has taken the view that they are not prepared to deal with this issue within the teachersWP extended char 4,28 conciliation and arbitration scheme which is the agreed industrial relations forum for processing these matters.</P>

      <P>The report of the National Social Work Qualifications Board of July 2000 provides baseline information on social work posts in Ireland, based on a survey of the position as at 1 September 1999. The survey concluded there were <Col N="797" /> not enough qualified social workers to fill available posts and that an increase in the number of graduates from professional social work courses would be required to meet future demand.</P>
      <P>On foot of this report, my officials are in ongoing discussions with the Higher Education Authority, the Department of Health and Children and the National Social Work Qualifications Board in regard to training places for social workers. The Department of Health and Children is putting arrangements in place to ensure an adequate supply of quality practice placements. A considerable expansion in provision has been agreed, with an extra 35 places being provided for the current academic year bringing the total number of places to 137.</P>
      <P>The location of these places is as follows:</P>
