      <P>I request the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to address the serious crisis in farming and horticulture caused by the unprecedented and unseasonal rainfall in recent weeks which is jeopardising 1,500 jobs and to consider what measures by way of financial support can be put in place to prevent many more growers and farmers from being put out of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 2<i>a</i>, a motion regarding the ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. <i>a</i>1, Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and <i>b</i>1, Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 2<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate and that Question Time tomorrow shall be taken at 3.30 p.m. until 4.45 p.m., and in the event of a Private Notice Question being allowed, it shall be taken at 4.15 p.m. and the Order shall not resume thereafter.

      <P>I do not agree with this item which brings to mind a travesty in terms of what Government has done in cancelling seven questions that I put down to the Taoiseach about the Seville summit. It remains a fact that the Taoiseach is not accountable to the Dáil on matters that will have a major impact on the country's future. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to ensure that he remains accountable. This item is a mockery of parliamentary activity when the Taoiseach can simply dismiss questions that are put down because he chooses not to be here.</P>

      <P>Accepting the very valid objection of my colleague, Deputy Sargent of the Green Party, I wish to relay a further objection. We have a request from the Government for a temporary alteration of the rota for ministerial questions in the House, yet we have an ongoing situation where the party that I represent and have the honour to lead in the House, that of Deputy Sargent, the Greens, and the independent Deputies have not had our position respected by Government in relation to the valid request regarding the rota and recognition of the integrity of our respective representative roles in this Chamber. There has been a significant roll back on an already signalled intent by Government to facilitate the required change of Standing Orders, which is extremely important for the good workings of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Tánaiste read today the story of a rip-off of Irish consumers in relation to prices? A survey has shown that a basket of basic products in St. Tropez would be 23% cheaper than in Ireland. This covers basic items such as water, meat, cheese and the pint of plain. Does the Tánaiste believe there is a rip-off occurring in relation to margins in the retail trade? Does she also believe, along with IBEC and the Central Bank, that we should be expressing alarm about the way prices here are rising so much faster than in other European countries? Would she also agree that out of control Government finances are fuelling this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has anybody drawn the Tánaiste's attention to the statement by a Mr. Brian Geoghegan, IBEC's director of consumer and economic affairs, that he was worried about public finances, that the Government had no room to manoeuvre and that inflation was at a critical stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin is placing me in a difficult position here. In relation to the query raised by Deputy Bruton and Deputy Howlin, I have heard of the comparative analysis done between a shopping basket in St. Tropez and Blackrock in Dublin. It does concern me, not just what emerged today but also the upward trend in inflation. Recently the Government commissioned a survey from Forfás, which will come to Cabinet shortly, on the increasing prices that are evident across the economy. There are a number of factors involved. In the first instance, indirect taxes are higher here on some products which would account for the difference. Another is insufficient competition, particularly in services. The most recent Competition Bill passed by the last Dáil will greatly enhance the powers of the Competition Authority to enforce competition and prevent collusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to develop a stronger consumer culture and equip consumers with more information. We need to do a host of things. Deregulation, which is often strongly resisted in Ireland by various vested interests, plays an important part in enhancing competition, reducing prices and improving the quality of services. I hope we will have the support of the Opposition when we seek to introduce whatever measures are required. However, all <Col N="557" /><Col N="558" /> these things cannot be done by Government action alone. As consumers, we have to be more vigilant and use our collective purchasing power more wisely. Some of the inflation in recent months is caused by increases in prescription costs, doctors' fees and so forth. There are many examples of the cost of professional services having increased way beyond what anybody could expect. Hopefully, the study of professional fees by the Competition Authority will play an important part in bringing about a change in the culture that exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister not advert to the main issue identified by Mr. Geoghegan, that Government finances being out of control is one of the central elements fuelling our high rates of inflation? Last year saw the price of groceries rise by 14%, a rise unparalleled anywhere in Europe. The Minister says she envisages competition measures to deal with this problem in the grocery trade. Will she indicate what she has in mind? Does she propose to amend the groceries order or any of the restrictions the Government has imposed in relation to the trade? Some of her party colleagues have indicated that the party has intentions in this area but I gather that the Minister has taken a different view.</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, perhaps the Minister should introduce the director of IBEC to the joys of St. Tropez and its cheap prices, which she used to enjoy in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Charlie will not like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good suggestion but I am trying to figure out who should pay for it. We must have an open mind about what measures need to be taken. I have said on a number of occasions that the groceries order is not written in stone. We must take whatever measures are necessary to keep prices down and increase competition. I hope I will have the support of every Member of the House if we find it necessary to introduce measures to enhance competition. However, as of now we have made no decisions; we have an open mind. We will await the report from Forfás after which the Government will make whatever decisions should be made in the interests of the economy and consumers.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the Deputy's comments about Government spending. Although the global figures are criticised by Fine Gael, day after day and particularly during the last election campaign that party was calling for more spending in all areas and Government intervention to compensate various groups of citizens. Their position is a little contradictory. The Government is conscious of the changed economic environment. Clearly we cannot have spending increases like those in the last couple of years but it is not a question of cutbacks but of slowing down the growth in public spending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that the country's largest anti-drugs organisation is to march to Government Buildings later today? Its members say there must be a refocus on the country's anti-drugs strategy. The Dublin Citywide Crisis Campaign has accused the Government of cutting back on the resources necessary to tackle the drugs problem and of not honouring the national drugs strategy in terms of resources and supports. What will the Tánaiste tell this organisation? Will she meet with it?</P>
      <P>The new Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has been given responsibility for the drugs issue. I wish him well in that job. Will there be a co-ordinated team dealing with community development and an anti-drugs strategy? What will be the role of the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, who is responsible for local development? I take this opportunity to congratulate the outgoing Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, who did an excellent job in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister make a specific commitment that all drugs projects would be ring fenced? It has been reported that she made a personal commitment in this regard during the general election campaign and that this is not now being honoured. The drugs strategy report clearly indicated that this area had to be ring fenced. That commitment should be honoured. Perhaps she will explain the exact status of the promise she made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I did make that commitment and it stands. All mainline projects involving the drugs task forces will be and are ring fenced. That is a fact. In relation to community employment generally, when we had high levels of unemployment there was one community employment place for every three long-term unemployed. Now there is one community employment place for 0.7 long-term unemployed people. That puts it in perspective. We have improved the situation threefold and substantially increased the number of people in training by between 14,000 and 16,000 per year. The focus of the Government has been to equip citizens with skills to enable them to access jobs in the economy.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that many services are being provided through community employment. That is the reason we are mainstreaming those services. I intend to have discussions with my colleague Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has responsibility for community affairs, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, about the drug task force areas, where we worked extremely well with the previous Minister, to ensure that all mainline projects are ring fenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am no wiser in relation to the specific responsibilities the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, will have. Will the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, look after urban areas of development? Is he responsible for the RAPID <Col N="560" /> programme, for example, and will that not be in the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern? In relation to the community employment schemes, I am seeking a specific commitment that all schemes supporting disadvantaged areas in general and drugs projects in particular will not be adversely affected by the reduction in the ceiling of CE places to 25,000 positions, which is 3,000 lower than the guaranteed floor under the last partnership programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has that commitment. There cannot be a drugs officer for every community employment scheme but any drugs related workers approved through the drugs task force initiative are ring fenced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two issues. Over the last number of months much damage to public property has taken place in County Wicklow due to illegal encampments. The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Act was passed by the Houses to deal with this issue but there appears to be much confusion between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard to its implementation. Currently, the Garda and the local authority have no powers under the legislation. Perhaps the Tánaiste would explain the situation.</P>
      <P>The Dáil will only sit for a few days between now and the end of the summer. The Tánaiste prides herself on having come from a small farm in the west. Will she permit time for statements on the possible negative impact on the agriculture and food industry of the long range weather forecast?</P>

    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, a Second Reading for at least three months until</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;a full assessment of best practice in regulatory supervision has been undertaken, which takes into account the lessons of recent regulatory failures (including the lessons of Enron and Allfirst); and</P>
    <P Just="Center">(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;a full assessment of best practice in providing consumer protection in relation to financial services has been undertaken; </P>
    <P Just="Center">and the proposed merger of consumer protection and prudential regulation into a single Regulatory Agency can be viewed against best practice requirements identified by those assessments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&mdash;(Deputy R. Bruton).</P>
    <P>Mr. Naughten: When the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, was in the House last evening, I made the point that the establishment of the regulator may lead to a conflict as he or she will have to examine the prudential aspect &ndash; making sure banks remain solvent &ndash; while also having responsibility for consumer protection. The concerns that are held in relation to this matter were outlined yesterday by my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, when he said that the prudential aspect will take precedence over consumer protection. This issue will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of this Bill, which inserts a new section 33D into the principal Act, provides that the Governor of the Central Bank may issue guidelines to the regulatory authority. This calls into question the independence of the regulator, as it may the case that he or she will be subservient to the bank itself. Consequently, the director of consumer affairs within the regulatory authority, who is subservient to the chief executive of the regulatory authority, is also subservient to the chief executive of the bank. There seems to be a conflict in the fact that an authority that was <Col N="567" /> originally intended to stand alone and have independent powers to ensure regulation within the industry will now have to report continually to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The staff of the new authority will be recruited from within the Central Bank and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance. The new agency's officials will naturally have a certain bias as a result of their previous experiences. The chief executive of the new body does not have the independence to appoint his or her own officials, as they will have to come from the Central Bank or the Departments. Such provisions cast doubt on the ability of the new authority to maintain the independence it will require. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicated confidence that such independence can be achieved in her response to the publication of this Bill, but many people who have commented on the Bill since its publication are not convinced.</P>
    <P>I understand that the compliance costs to be imposed will be borne by the financial services industry, which means that the consumer will ultimately pay. There will be a knock-on effect in terms of charges on the consumer, an issue to which I will return.</P>
    <P>It is important that the regulator is accountable to a committee of this House. When the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was established by the Minister, Deputy Harney, she ensured that the director would have to report to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. The committee has the power to call the director to appear before it if questions have to be asked in relation to certain investigations and this does not compromise the office's investigations. I ask the Minister for Finance to investigate the corporate enforcement mechanism that has been put in place so that a similar mechanism can be applied to ensure that the financial services regulator is accountable to this House. It is important that we do not repeat the mistake made during the establishment of the National Roads Authority, a body which is not accountable to this House.</P>
    <P>The director of consumer protection will have a role under this Bill in relation to bank charges. It is important that this issue is addressed as concerns have been expressed on many occasions about the lack of transparency in relation to bank charges. Particular worries have been outlined as regards credit cards, as consumers are baffled by the various rates on offer. One would need a degree in advanced mathematics and a dedicated team of experts to work out the interest charged on credit card transactions. The transparency needed to help citizens shop around and benefit from the most competitive rates does not exist at present. Interest rates must be made easier to understand if those of us without a degree in calculus are to compare credit card products. Many new credit card companies have entered the Irish <Col N="568" /> market and have advertised different APRs, but direct comparison is impossible.</P>
    <P>The UK Consumers' Association has estimated that the repayment of an identical credit card debt with an identical APR can vary by up to 40% and I imagine that a similar situation prevails here. I ask the Minister for Finance to ensure that the promotion of transparency is one of the first tasks of the director of consumer affairs within the regulatory authority. Direct comparison between the rates charged by various credit card companies is especially necessary in Ireland as we have some of the highest credit card rates in the EU. It is unacceptable that one should need to be a mathematician to work out the actual rates charged and to make valid comparisons. The transparency we need cannot be found, as it has been a tradition of the banks not to provide it. The Central Bank has ignored these issues over many years; it is not prepared to ensure that high street banks and credit card companies promote a policy of transparency.</P>
    <P>Recent falls in the stock markets in the EU and the United States have led to concerns about solvency levels within the life assurance sector. This causes serious concern because many insurers hold investments of billions of euro within the equity markets. Concern has been expressed also in regard to home loans which are tied into the equity markets. Many young couples tied themselves into this type of mechanism which was promoted by the banks. Because of the drop off in interest rates the banks pursued the equity markets and encouraged people to invest in them. The equity markets have now gone down. There is concern within the home loan sector in this regard because people planned to get back a certain dividend. The banks gave the impression that to invest in the equity markets would be money for nothing. Many of those young couples have serious concerns at the moment. There is a need for the new consumer director within the regulatory authority to ensure these products are marketed correctly and that the risks associated with them are highlighted so that consumers can make an informed decision.</P>
    <P>The legislation must address the huge responsibility in regard to consumer protection. I have concerns in regard to how the regulator has been established. There are questions over the independence of the regulator and the independence of the consumer protection element. That is the reason my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, tabled the amendment. The issue must be re-assessed to ensure the consumer is given priority. This has not been the case in the past with the Central Bank, a fact which in itself raises serious questions. I hope the Minister will re-assess the position before proceeding with the legislation.</P>

      <P>I make no secret of the fact that for a long time I have been an advocate of retaining the regulatory function of the financial services within the general ambit of the Central Bank. I took the matter up in a number of Dáil committees and forcefully made the argument in this regard and contrary to the recommendations of the McDowell report. I was very much an advocate of what the Minister now advocates in the Bill whereby the regulator is strongly regulated from within the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise the contribution the financial services have played in Ireland, particularly the role of the Irish Financial Services Centre, which led to the resurgence in our economic fortunes in the 1980s. It is no accident that the IFSC has become a flagship of our renewal, recovery and improvement as an economy. It was the decision by Dermot Desmond and the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, to set up the Financial Services Centre which led to the stabilising of the economy and the renewed interest from abroad in investing in Ireland. It is no accident that planting the flag in the docklands brought about a situation whereby international investors took a different view of Ireland. Some of the biggest players in the financial services scene decided it was worth investing there. The whole thing is a huge success story with over 6,000 employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not forget that over the years the financial services have made a huge contribution towards restoring our economic fortunes. It is no accident that officials from the Department of Finance used to be embarrassed at the riches the Financial Services Centre contributed in terms of Exchequer returns. I recall as a journalist reporting on many Exchequer returns where this item was politely hidden at the back of the returns. The taxes raised from the Financial Services Centre made an enormous contribution to the improved balance sheet of the national books. This is something we must be mindful of going forward. We must protect what exists in the Financial Services Centre, albeit some of it tax driven. Much of it is driven by the skilled people who work there. I suppose I have a vested interest because my wife works there and I need her to continue. I am making an argument in my own interest that we must continue to protect the Financial Services Centre. We must develop and build on the level of skills because in future from a tax treatment point of view those jobs will to an extent be insecure. Given that the tax advantages of locating in this area are being eroded, this must be replaced by a high skill factor. The pull for investors must be the clear advantage for them to invest in the area because of the skills <Col N="570" /> and support available. Importantly, innovation skills and financial instruments can be availed of by international investors.</P>
    <P>I emigrated to England in the 1980s at the time of the fabled &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; where the financial services sector was encouraged to go electronic. It was a very interesting time to arrive in London and witness what was happening in the financial services area. We must be careful how we regulate here. That is why the regulation of the financial services by the Central Bank, with a new regulator and new transparent procedures, is very important because international investors require world class regulation. If we depart from that we will lose out.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that many investors like to be regulated by a central bank. It is noticeable that this Minister won the debate in Cabinet. This is important because the head of the European Central Bank, Mr. Duisenberg, made it very clear on numerous occasions that he would prefer if the Central Bank retained that function. I am pleased his intervention led to this result from the Cabinet and I congratulate the Minister on achieving it.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable to denigrate the role and work of the Central Bank over the years but it is less fashionable to understand that the financial markets have gone through an enormous transformation over the last few years, not just in Ireland but at a global level. What we are seeing is more liberalisation, more deregulation, more globalisation and more sophisticated financial instruments, not least in the area of derivatives, swaps and other forms of security. I was very proud to have played a role with the Minister in introducing the Asset Covered Securities Bill. This legislation will allow our financial services to grow further. It will try to make the financial services more attractive for people who wish to invest here.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued at Deputy Naughten's statement last night that the new body had no power to impose sanctions against directors or senior executives of banks or financial institutions who behave in an improper manner. That is simply not the case. The existing legislation provides for a role by the Central Bank when it comes to the appointment of senior managers, senior executives or director level appointments in banks. All these appointments must be cleared in advance by the Central Bank. It is a role the Central Bank has played in a very active manner over the years. This is not advertised in the newspapers and perhaps that is the reason Deputy Naughten was not aware of the particular function. In effect, it is a vetting procedure, not unlike the procedure adopted by the Garda Síochána when it comes to crucial or key appointments. Naturally, that is an issue that is not advertised, but what happens is very simple. Appointments are assessed by the Central Bank and if it regards a person as unsuitable or as lacking the experience to work in a vital area involving financial risk and control, that is indicated and the appointment does not gener<Col N="571" /> ally go ahead. The banks get the message and do not appoint such persons. It is an important matter and I am glad it was raised because, increasingly, we are seeing new walls in the banking industry between the traders who take the risks and those who control the risks in the control rooms. It is vital that continues to happen more and more and the financial services authority will play its role in the encouragement of that trend. We have had a number of very high profile cases internationally. The Rusnak affair has its own lessons for Allied Irish Banks and there was also the Nick Leeson rogue trader affair in which a great, blue-blood, blue-chip bank went out of business overnight. It is important that the rogue traders are controlled and policed properly. This Bill will provide for that while maintaining the primacy of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I am glad we did not go down the same path as the UK. Having two regulators is flawed and the British are even having second thoughts about that. We have gone the right route in not copying their example and in going ahead and regulating properly.</P>
    <P>There are a few points which are new and interesting about this. The role of the credit union is important in financial services, as is the recognition of that by the Minister. Increasingly, people will depend on the credit unions for their small loans, such as those for going to the World Cup. Why would they not? In relation to the issues raised by Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister has addressed wholesale tax evasion in the banking industry, as was uncovered by the DIRT Inquiry. It is important that the Central Bank has the power to refer cases where it sees widespread or concerted tax evasion by a particular industry. That will happen when the Minister brings in this new legislation.</P>
    <P>We are also providing for an ombudsman for financial services, which is important from the customer's point of view. In our constituency work we all run into people who feel they have been unfairly treated or charged the wrong interest rate over a period of years. Some of us have uncovered extraordinary stories where financial institutions were docking too much in interest over periods of ten or 14 years, which people only discovered when it was too late. Often, when people seek redress they are bombarded with paper work and asked to produce documentation which they cannot find for obvious reasons, given that it is ten years old. It is important to have an ombudsman to investigate these matters on behalf of those who feel their rights have been transgressed. I discovered after switching banks on one occasion that I was being docked for a loan that I had paid off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>By asking me to provide proof of something that happened five to eight years <Col N="572" /> earlier, the bank was putting the onus on me. I simply wrote it a letter asking it to prove that the loan existed. I won that one and I was very happy about it, though the bank seemed to be freaked out a little by my aggressive approach. I do not feel too sorry for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now provided for regulation, though it is a pity there was such a long delay and that the debate had to go on for so long at Cabinet. It would have been better had this happened more quickly, but it is now in place and we will have a world class system of regulation. We should not lose the run of ourselves because there is a danger that we could over-regulate financial services. It is inevitable, given the enormous globalisation that has occurred, that regulation will lag behind the market, which has been the case for centuries in financial services. Regulation always has and always will lag behind the innovation that takes place in areas like this. It is important to keep up and we have made every effort to do so in line with our new-found wealth. However, we must not over-regulate the banking sector to the extent that it becomes a disincentive factor. Many of those from abroad who establish financial services here do so precisely because they believe the regulation is good, not heavy handed, and that should not be lost sight of.</P>
      <P>It is fashionable to bash the banks and to criticise them. We have all had our difficulties with them at times, but we should not over-regulate them to the extent that it becomes unattractive for people to invest here, not because the country is not doing well, but because there is an overarching panoply of regulation which acts as a disincentive. We have seen many of the European economies &ndash; France and Germany in particular &ndash; trying to move away from the over-regulation they have imposed in terms of labour market practices and in other areas. We should be conscious of that and, in our zeal to get closer to Berlin, not replicate the mistakes continental countries have made in the way they regulated their economies. We have to be close to Boston in that regard.</P>
      <P>I praise the Minister for this and wish all of the new Ministers of State success in their briefs, in particular Deputy Browne who is sitting in front of me.

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words about the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Central Bank Act, 1942, to reorganise and rename it. That is fine by me. It also seeks to establish a financial services regulatory authority, a financial services appeals tribunal and to amend certain other Acts consequential on the reorganisation of the Central Bank of Ireland. The Bill states that it should be noted that it is intended to achieve its objectives by means of amending of existing legislation and there is, therefore, a good deal of restatement and reordering of existing legislation. When one reads that, turns to what is happening on the ground and looks at the history of banking institutions here and how they have served the people, a few points suggest themselves which I wish to make forcefully.</P>
      <P>Banks have been central to the development of our economy. Banks in towns and villages have played their part nationally and locally and they have benefited hugely. They have enjoyed enormous profits, but their customers are not happy. According to the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, there was legislation but people are not satisfied with what they got. In south Tipperary, in a place called Killenaule, the location of which the Minister of State knows well, people have been sitting-in at a local bank for the last two days to protest against the cutting back of hours of service. The local development association felt so strongly that on Tuesday evening five very respected members of the community entered the bank with their sleeping bags and have been occupying it since. They have taken on the fight at every level. They have contacted the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the head office of the bank involved but the bank is still going ahead with the partial closure. The people involved are from a rural area that has been neglected for various reasons but they are determined to keep the community alive. The story I related about Killenaule can be repeated about several other small towns and villages.</P>
      <P>Banks have gone down the road of closure of small branches and have left communities with no alternative but to do what the Killenaule community has done. The time has come for banks to redefine this policy. They have benefited significantly from rural communities with small and dwindling populations that have been forgotten. If the financial institutions reassess the direction in which they are going, they will discover it is profitable to remain committed to small rural communities. People in these communities have been more loyal to the banks involved than some of their bigger customers to whom they have pandered over the years. I call on them to give a greater commitment to small towns and villages such as Killenaule and provide better facilities, through a shared operation, for example, in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" />There is another aspect to this issue. The Government is correctly criticised for being slow to decentralise Departments and offices to rural towns but there is nothing to prevent financial institutions from relocating their head offices from major centres of populations to towns that have a great deal to offer such as Tipperary, Carrick-on-Suir and many others throughout the country. These towns have the infrastructure and facilities to enable banks to decentralise sections of their operations from Dublin and other cities.</P>
    <P>If decentralisation is to be successful and have a significant impact on Ireland's development, the private sector must participate together with the Government. Financial institutions have a major role to play given that they have taken the lead on other issues in the past. If they are serious about Ireland's development and long-term prospects they must play their part and keep small, rural branches open. They must also examine the possibility of relocating some of their operations to the regions to support the development of towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I refer to the cost of credit from financial institutions. When an individual applies for a Visa card, a car loan or a mortgage it is almost impossible to calculate the difference in the cost of credit between one institution and another because special offers are promoted and extra charges are hidden. This is unfair, particularly to young people who apply for a house loan and are at a vulnerable stage of their lives. I regularly introduce people to the loans officer of my county council. Purchasing a house is the biggest step they will take in their lives and they must deal with auctioneers, solicitors and a host of other professionals. They are under the greatest pressure and, therefore, the amount they must repay should be more clearly defined.</P>
    <P>When one goes into a shop to buy a pound of butter, one knows what it will cost. When one enters a public house, one will know the price of a pint of Guinness because it can be seen on a price list in the bar. However, the cost of credit is not clearly outlined and consumers are, therefore, at a loss, particularly those who purchase houses.</P>
    <P>The same applies to credit cards. One would need to be a magician to work out which financial institution offers the cheapest credit. Special offers and promotions are widely available. I attended a race meeting on one occasion and was given a free travel bag in return for completing a form for a credit card company. I did not complete the credit card application because I already had a credit card but I was given a free travel bag. These gimmicks should be banned because people are vulnerable when they seek credit and clearer guidelines are needed.</P>
    <P>I refer to another issue which is the greatest disgrace of all time. When one undertakes to buy a new car, one visits various garages and the price varies by a few euro. I recently purchased a new car and there was such a minuscule difference in prices between different dealerships, it hardly <Col N="575" /> covered the cost of the petrol I used travelling between them. However, I subsequently discovered how dealers make money. They receive an under the table payment if they recommend a certain financial institution to car buyers who need a car loan. I am led to believe car dealers can earn up to &euro;900 per loan and I would like clarification on this. If it is true, consumers are being ripped off. Some people must borrow to buy a car and they do not benefit from these payments. I would like clarification as to whether such payments are covered by the Bill because, if they are not, amendments should be tabled to address this issue.</P>
    <P>It is totally unfair given that motorists are ripped off anyway as a result of the high cost of motoring. Cars are an essential part of our lives, no matter where we live, and the cost of car insurance is also another issue. It is disgraceful that payments are made to car dealers and I ask the Minister of State to clarify this when he replies. If he cannot do so then, I would like him to communicate with me at a later date in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill, when passed, will benefit the consumer but I call on financial institutions to be more helpful to their customers who have been good to them in the past. The banks have contributed a great deal to communities but certain areas have not benefited. I ask the Minister of State to listen to the good, honest people of Killenaule, County Tipperary, who are so frustrated that they have undertaken a sit-in at a bank branch to secure that to which they believe their community is entitled.</P>

      <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, states that the Bill will amend the Central Bank Act, 1942, for the purposes of re-organising and re-naming the Central Bank of Ireland, that it will establish the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the Financial Services Appeal Tribunal and will amend certain other Acts consequential on the re-organisation of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the features of the banking system in recent years has been the effective privatisation of the banking service. There is now a private banking cartel and a situation has been allowed to develop where what I call public service banking does not exist. TSB has been sold off and there is no third banking force which means there is now little or no competition in the banking sector. The private banks are operating as a cartel and have a policy of withdrawing from all rural towns and deprived urban areas with significant levels of unemployment where huge profits cannot be made. They are prepared to deal only in areas where they will make enormous profits. The half-yearly bank profits are in hundreds of millions of euro and some banks are making nearly &euro;1 billion in profit. The banks are taking the pro<Col N="576" /> fits and are reinvesting very little if anything back into local communities. This is particularly evident in rural areas and towns.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made in the House to Tipperary where the Allied Irish Bank branch in Killenaule has announced that it will not open for business on two days per week. The only guarantee being given is that the bank branch will stay in existence for the next five years. Last Monday, 17 June, at 4 o'clock five decent, honourable and respectable people from the local community took up the cudgels for their town and area and began a sit-in in the branch. John O'Dwyer of Pike Street, Killenaule; Seán Watts of Knockavardagh, Killenaule; Tony Cullivan of Bailey Street, Killenaule; John Lahert of Main Street, Killenaule; Séamus Kennedy of Waterloo, Killenaule, are all at present in the bank. They are demanding very little, merely that the decision be deferred and that the bank meet a deputation. The bank has refused to do that and continues in its policy of closing the branch on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. There is almost unanimous support in Killenaule for those who are occupying the bank. The Slieveardagh area has suffered significant unemployment. A study undertaken about two years ago by the small areas research unit of Trinity College indicated that this was one of the most deprived areas in the constituency and in the county. The study found that 50% of the people of Tipperary South lived in what were described as deprived areas. Deprivation was defined on a scale of one to five with one being best and five being the most deprived. The Slieveardagh area was in categories four and five of deprivation having large-scale unemployment and very little industry. People from the area looking for employment have to go as far as Kilkenny, Thurles or Clonmel to find work. The closure of the bank branch for two days a week is seen as the forerunner of the complete closure of the bank. It fits into a pattern evident in rural areas where not only banks but co-ops and Garda stations are closing. In many rural areas people can only speak to a garda by means of the Green Man speaker on the wall of the barracks.</P>
    <P>I support fully the action taken by the five individuals and by the local development association in their efforts to ensure that the bank remains open for the foreseeable future in order to service the local community. I ask the Minister to immediately contact Mr. John Hickey, the manager of retail banking at AIB, to ensure the bank at least meets a deputation from the local community. I ask the Minister to contact the manager of AIB in Killenaule, Mary Bermingham, and indicate the concerns expressed in the House about this matter.</P>
    <P>The banking sector is being operated by private enterprise in a cartel arrangement and there is no competition being provided by public banking facilities. Fethard is quite a large town situated between Clonmel and Killenaule but it does not have even an ATM machine. The question of fees <Col N="577" /> charged for banking services and for the use of credit cards and cheques is of concern to many people. Fees provide huge profits for the banks.</P>
    <P>I hope that significant amendments to this Bill will be taken to ensure events such as in Killenaule will not arise in the future. The banking service must respond to the needs of local communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill, 2002, relates to the powers of the Central Bank in how the financial services and banks are regulated. I wish to see the banks being regulated and dealt with in a far more radical way than is proposed in this Bill. The banks are massively powerful institutions in this State.</P>
      <P>The two leading private banks in the State bring in annual profits of well in excess of &euro;1 billion. Their influence reaches into virtually every area of economic activity and they have the power to influence hugely the lives of citizens across the State. Yet these massively powerful institutions, which have such an impact on the economy, are privately owned and are not open to democratic accountability by way of being directly accountable to the millions of customers who are dependent on their services and whose fees and money make the huge profits these banks accrue annually. We therefore have a situation where largely faceless men and women attend secret board meetings and make decisions that affect the lives of millions of citizens. That does not square with the idea that we live in a democratic State. The democracy of the State relates to the possibility of people going out to vote for a Government every five years but in economic areas of life, which have a huge impact on people's living standards, jobs and quality of life, we have no control over the institutions whose decisions have a huge impact on those crucial areas.</P>
      <P>On a regular basis the banks change their regimes of charges and fees in a way that suits themselves. As a customer of one of these banks, I regularly receive notification of new charges or changes in the facilities available and without exception these benefit the bottom line of the bank in question rather than facilitating the ordinary citizen who is dependent on the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully concur with Deputy Healy's comments on the attitude of the main banks to rural Ireland. It is outrageous that in many rural towns the banks have not just closed down their services by cutting the number of days the bank is open, but they have abandoned some rural areas completely. The argument invariably given is that it is not profitable to maintain a branch in a rural society. This is absolutely impermissible at a time when rural Ireland is under threat and small farmers are under severe pressure. The fall in price for produce such as milk and the appalling weather of spring and early summer have put small vegetable growers and so on under enormous pressure. The banks, which are massively <Col N="578" /> powerful and profitable, make decisions based only on what affects their profitability and not on what affects the quality of life in areas of rural life which are already under pressure. That is absolutely impermissible.</P>
    <P>For example, a majority of people are of the view that a public transport infrastructure has to be maintained within the State. That means running a service in areas which will not make an immediate profit because it is a necessary social service for certain communities &ndash; rural areas of low population. The banks should be required in exactly the same way to spread their profits and to see this as a benefit which accrues from business generally within the State. If they have to take a small part of the profit from some branches in the rural towns or even suffer a loss of some kind, then so be it. They should be required to do so in the interests of these communities and of society generally.</P>
    <P>That is a position the major establishment parties have not put to the banks at any stage in past decades. We have had a very unhealthy relationship between the banking sector and the major political parties of the State, which received substantial amounts of money in donations from the banks in the 1980s and 1990s. That is a total conflict of interest and completely unethical. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party benefited to a substantial degree from both Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland by way of large donations. Every citizen knows that no big business element gives away money for charity or the so-called good of democracy. They hope to influence Government policy and one or two percentage points one way or the other in a budget or a crucial financial provision can make a difference of tens of millions of pounds in profits to these banks. Though legal, it is corrupt to have had a situation where the major parties, which established the tax regime for the banks, on one hand receive large donations from the banks and on the other make policies which can be hugely beneficial to those banks. That is part of the reason the banks have been a law unto themselves.</P>
    <P>I will not go over the ground which is now well known regarding the various scams and schemes operated by the most powerful bank to evade taxes and to defraud the Exchequer at a time in the 1980s and early 1990s when the ordinary PAYE worker was crucified by the level of taxation. We saw there the failure to regulate and to ensure the banking institutions of the State were a service for the people rather than for the institutional or individual shareholders, whose only interest is profit. There have also been unhealthy and questionable dealings between the banks and the semi-State sector. We continue to see semi-State companies forced to acquire huge debts from the banks and forced to pay a huge amount of their revenue in interest alone.</P>
    <P>When the Government came forward with the proposal to privatise Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, I highlighted how that company which was in the ownership of the State was bled dry by a grouping <Col N="579" /> of banks which in the 1980s extended significant loans to it. I showed how by 1997 that semi-State body had paid back, if I am correct, £148 million which was loaned to it by the banks. That institution repaid that amount in interest alone. This huge organised rip-off by the banks of the semi-State sector continued for about ten years and not a single member of Government or of the major political parties put up his or her hand in opposition to it. The argument has been advanced for the privatisation of these companies &ndash; Aer Lingus, ESB, etc. &ndash; and how their cost base must be reduced when any objective analysis would show that a huge part of the costs of some crucial semi-State bodies comprised interest payments to the banks where these companies had been forced to apply for loans, successive Governments having refused to fund them to the proper extent.</P>
    <P>The other area to which the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, should refer when replying, is the question of the transfer to the euro and the incredible price rip-off that is happening under cover of the changeover to the euro. I note from one of the sections of the Bill that in performing its functions and exercising its powers as part of the European system of central banks, the primary objective of the Central Bank is to maintain price stability. I take it that refers to maintaining a regime in the economy that is not inflationary. Yet the Government and the Minister for Finance have sat on their hands while there is a huge rip-off on a weekly basis of the ordinary citizens in this State under cover of the euro changeover. Has the Central Bank any role in this area and will the Minister explain why the Government washes its hands of this responsibility when there is an orgy of profiteering taking place in certain sectors of the economy, in certain services etc. resulting in a cost to the ordinary consumer who has no redress whatsoever? When workers, teachers or other groups seek decent pay rises to make up for that situation the venom of the media and the Government loudly denounces them, yet the Government is prepared to see vested interests use the financial system, in this case the changeover supervised by the Central Bank, in this particular way.</P>
    <P>What I would like to see, as a representative of the Socialist Party, is a banking system in public ownership. It is wrong that institutions which have such power over people's lives and whose decisions can have such drastic effects on workers in particular employments right across the board should be in private and unaccountable hands. Instead of what is proposed in the Bill, the major banks should be taken into public ownership and be democratically owned and controlled. The boards should be composed of personnel knowledgeable in financial matters, consumers &ndash; ordinary users of the bank &ndash; and workers from semi-State boards so that that we would have a banking system where investment would be in the interest of the majority, in the interest of society and in the interest of preserving the quality of life <Col N="580" /> in rural areas rather than banks soaking what they can from the system. I believe we will have such a system in the future. Of course, that would be anathema to the Minister for Finance who is a champion of privatisation and multinational corporations taking over large sectors of the economy rather than democratic accountability, ownership and control which would mean the banks would have to carry out their economic activities for the benefit of society and the achievement of social goals rather than the accumulation of huge profits as at present.</P>
    <P>I outlined figures earlier in regard to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta on its proposed privatisation. In reply to a parliamentary question from me, the Tánaiste replied that since 1987 an incredible £188 million was paid in interest alone on borrowings of £164 million. That is an astounding figure. Will the Minister for Finance avail of the opportunity to say why successive Ministers and those responsible for the semi-State bodies, allowed such an organised and co-ordinated rip-off of the taxpayer through the exploitation of this particular semi-State company? I would prefer regulation to root out that type of abuse and exploitation of the taxpayer rather than the less than radical measure before the House.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this legislation. It is no harm to comment on the importance of financial services here. The financial services here are recognised internationally as being of great importance. All credit is due to former Taoisigh who encouraged the location of such services here. It should also be recognised that it is important that the services run effectively and in accordance with the controls and checks and balances required. If not, far from being prestigious, they could undermine the entire economy and public confidence in the economy and in the services themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banking revolves around international confidence. If one is providing a service in which there is not sufficient confidence in the international markets, it will eventually fall apart and everyone will pay the price. The financial services, above and beyond all others, impact on all of us. If run effectively and correctly under strict guidelines, they reflect on the whole country and everybody gets the benefit. If the reverse happens, everybody pays the price, not only in interest rates but in pay backs and so on. The pay back I have in mind is the heavy repayment of interest, as referred to by the previous speaker. I recall, when I became a Member, a particular financial service located outside the country ran into financial difficulties and the customers, insurers and various other people had to become involved in paying back. The banking system itself did not make the biggest sacrifice, rather the general public had to pick up the tab. It is that issue I will address. That was 20 years ago. In more recent times, there have been illustrations of financial enterprises operating outside this jurisdiction, whose parent <Col N="581" /> company resides here, running into trouble. We are all aware of the events at Allfirst in the United States.</P>
    <P>What is interesting in this regard is that the Secretary General of the Department of Finance intimated some time ago to the Committee of Public Accounts that it was possible, under existing legislation, for the banking system to have been more seriously damaged because the Central Bank had no control over overseas ventures of a banking system whose parent company resided here. That has serious significance not just for the banking system, but for the business sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is unthinkable, for example, that vast amounts of a bank's resources could be siphoned off through an overseas subsidiary. We were extremely lucky that the damage was manageable, although I am sure the financial outlet concerned did not think so. Let us ponder for a moment the idea that the problem was not discovered for another year. What would have happened then? How does a parent company which, despite all the modern technology available, is unaware of a problem react to losing so much money so quickly? I presume nobody knew about the enterprising management style operated within the subsidiary. I sincerely hope that is the case because anybody who knew about it was duty bound to ring the alarm bells much earlier.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed two cases of this kind during my time in the House, the most recent being the most serious. I do not think our system could bear another in the foreseeable future. Such an event would have a seriously damaging effect on confidence in our economy. Our international standing and prestige would be seriously damaged if that was to happen again.</P>
    <P>We all know checks and balances are in place to ensure this does not happen again and that there is a sequence of events which should take place if, for instance, a pressure release valve does not work. We all know what happened at the DIRT inquiry. Document SMI.263 was put in abeyance for very good reason &ndash; for a specific period only &ndash; to enable the budget and the Finance Bill to take effect and to allow them to bed down. However, that document was never reactivated resulting in a situation where vast sums of money could be placed offshore and taken out of the economy. It is frightening that this happened in the early 1980s. If repeated now, given the advances in technology, it could have much more serious consequences for this country. I know the Minister, who happens to be my constituency colleague, and I are at one on this issue. No Minister for Finance can operate in a situation where if one of the checks and balances is missing, if one item is taken from the chain of command and nobody spots it, the whole economy is rendered vulnerable. The consequences of such an event do not bear contemplation.</P>
    <P>The DIRT inquiry, after the event, went back over the processes and procedures that were in place and which should have been in place. What <Col N="582" /> it did not do was emphasise the full extent of damage that could have been done. For example, there was constant discussion in the early 1980s about a black hole. The questions often asked were where was the money going and how it was not possible for the Department or the Minister for Finance to reach a conclusion on what was happening. It was not possible because of the absence of the senior inspectors memo which permitted a person to convert a bank account to an offshore account while keeping the money in the country and often the same bank. There was a link missing from the chain and nobody reacted to it for almost ten years.</P>
    <P>It is important that the public has absolute confidence in the banking system and the Central Bank and the Department of Finance's control of the system. We must ensure such controls are put in place and kept in place and that all financial institutions adhere to them. This does not relate to individual financial institutions. It may well be more profitable for them to cut corners, but that is not good for the banking system or the economy. Such actions call public confidence into play. I hope this legislation has been sufficiently tweaked to deal with all possible situations in the future.</P>
    <P>Banking today is less consumer friendly than heretofore. We regularly hear of the closure of various banks for what are called rationalisation or productivity reasons. However, we all know it is about economics. Economics determine the degree to which services are provided. Financial institutions must observe good economic criteria at all times. It is also important for them to remember &ndash; this has happened in other countries &ndash; that they have a duty to the customer and it is important to keep them on side. It is important that they recognise that the customer is not always wrong.</P>
    <P>The customer is entitled to know whether that is a legitimate deduction. That is part and parcel of what will put the financial services sector and the banking system on par with those elsewhere. I emphasise that point because it is important to continue to ensure that our banking system and the manner in which it deals with its customers is seen to be as effective as others elsewhere and better than most. We are an island nation and we have to raise the standards and set ourselves up as experts in that area. The financial services sector has done that already and it is important to maintain it.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that the commercial banks would recognise that while they are providing their customers with a service, the customers are also providing the banks with a service by way of providing them with funds and creating the need to have a visible shop front in every town and village, where possible. Presenting themselves in that fashion should not always come down to the economics of the issue.</P>
    <P>The general public has great difficulty when it hears that the branch system is to be revised, for want of a better description, because it is losing <Col N="583" /> money. The banks will say that, economically, a particular branch is not viable due to the small number of customers using it and that in any case they all move to the next town and village and invest there, although there may be other reasons for that. The people almost cry into their handkerchiefs when they hear this tale of sadness and poverty emanating from the financial system concerned&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but when the same institution issues its annual or six monthly returns it turns out that it has made an enormous profit and is competing with similar institutions in other financial services to show how viable it is and the billions it made in the past six or 12 months. That rings very hollow with the unfortunate customers who could walk into their local branch and cash their cheques. They will say that somebody is telling them a fib. The bottom line is that the customer is seen by the financial institutions as a disposable asset, for want of a better description. It is unfortunate, but that is the reality. The commercial banks would do well to recognise that the goodwill of the public is also important. They can spend a great deal of money on advertising to ingratiate themselves with the public but it should be borne in mind that a more practical demonstration carries a lot more weight.</P>
      <P>I recently had occasion to attempt to assist a social welfare recipient in opening a bank account. That person was required to produce a driving licence, a birth certificate and a series of other documents. The ordinary citizen becomes upset and suspicious when somebody asks him or her that many questions. I queried this request with the bank and the reply was that the Houses of the Oireachtas introduced legislation which controlled the way bank accounts are opened and operated. That is right but it had to be done. The Minister for Finance had to do that because on one famous occasion dubious proceeds were found in a bank account which, allegedly, was opened legitimately in a certain part of the country. That issue was dealt with during the course of the DIRT inquiry as well. There is a vast difference between somebody lodging ill-gotten gains of one kind or other in large amounts in a bank account and an individual wishing to have his or her social welfare payments made through a particular bank account. It is easy to authenticate one as opposed to the other so the comparisons pass me by when I hear of social welfare recipients being put to that kind of trouble.</P>
      <P>My final point is a general one. I do not propose to offer advice to my good friend and constituency colleague&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>He is open to advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;although I know he is always open to good advice. Like many people, I am <Col N="584" /> concerned about the likelihood that inflation will impact ultimately on interest rates because that is the way the system works now. If inflation rises above the European average, that in turn will put pressure on interest rates and, whether we like it, interest rates are not business or consumer friendly. They cost the economy more and can cause serious problems such as spiralling inflation. A rise in interest rates and inflation can be fuelled by the type of issues that have been referred to by previous speakers. For example, people seek higher wages as a result of not being able to live under the system as it currently stands. They may demand higher wages to allow them buy a house, for example. The whole question of house prices has fuelled inflation here for the past four or five years. That problem has not been resolved and the average first-time house buyer, be they young professionals or whatever, cannot buy an average starter home. That has to be borne in mind even in the context of this legislation because if we are talking about banking and financial services, and we will be talking about the economy at some stage in the future, it naturally follows that those issues that contribute to creating a threat should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief but I could not let the opportunity pass to talk about my very good friends in the banks who have used the Dáil and society when it suits them but have not given much back to the State. I remember the Dáil being recalled during a summer recess for the purpose of saving AIB, but AIB did not learn from that experience. Some weeks ago it almost happened again when one guy in the United States nearly brought down a financial institution, which would have had major effects on this country. That gave the impression that we were not able to look after our own business.</P>
      <P>I often wonder about the role of the Central Bank. The Central Bank should be given the powers and more staff to control the banks on a day to day basis. If a complaint is made about a bank and the Central Bank wants to inspect the way it is operated, it should have those powers. There is no doubt that the banks have let people down. It is the old story, they give people an umbrella on a fine day but take it back on a rainy day. They certainly have not played their part in the country's economy. The banks are closing branches in rural Ireland instead of providing the necessary service for the people. The Central Bank should have a role and be able to say where a bank should be located. We could take the example of Westport where there was no ATM 15 years ago as no bank would put one there. Then the AIB put one in and a month later the Bank of Ireland followed. After that the Irish Permanent installed one and now the AIB has two machines. They did this because they saw that it worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, someone in authority should have made them put these machines into that tourist town earlier. We could also look at Louisburgh <Col N="585" /> which is 13 miles away and which the Minister has visited. It has suffered unemployment and is in a disadvantaged area. It is trying to live off tourism but it cannot get any of the major banks to install an ATM. The travelling banks, which did go to such places, have been withdrawn and the service of opening for two or three days has been reduced to a half day. That town is trying to create employment for the county, yet the banks, which make millions of euro profit, do not see fit to install an ATM.</P>
    <P>We know that we are now in the world of credit cards and people using cards to withdraw money. I read an article recently about bank charges where a newspaper got someone to work out how the interest rate is calculated on credit charges. That person, who had a degree, found it very difficult to do. The Minister, the Dáil and the Central Bank should make the banks simplify their business. Documentation should be in simple language and not banker's jargon. It reminds me of this Bill because a person would need four degrees to understand it. Why can the Minister, who has made many good changes, not put the language of the Bill in lay person's terms so that we can know what the legal experts are trying to say? Not everyone has a degree in law or the resources to get the information on particular bills. It is the same with banks which cause such confusion that people do not understand what they are paying for when they pay big credit charges to banks which make a fortune by ripping off the customer. Someone should be there to protect the ordinary person and to tell the banks that the way they calculate accounts or charge interest rates is unacceptable because customers do not understand them. The Central Bank should be doing that and also make the banks provide services to people which they can understand. It should also have the power to say that banks should be located where they are needed.</P>
    <P>Banks are getting richer, bigger and more powerful because there is no competition. If Governments had brought in the necessary legislation to allow post offices and credit unions to take business away from banks, there would have been competition and banks would have had to try to get customers. I would hate to see the amalgamation of the AIB and the Bank of Ireland and oppose it bitterly because we do not want more amalgamation but more competition. I would prefer to have banks from Europe and elsewhere competing and putting pressure on our banks to give the customers what they need. We should have a better choice of banks in place of the limited choice we have now. The banks control the market and I am sure that at the beginning of each week the chief executives of the AIB, the Bank of Ireland and the others phone each other to decide what they will do as it is in their interests. That is why someone should be appointed to protect the consumer and there should be an appeal system for customers who believe they are not being treated fairly by the banks. There ought to be an ombudsman with <Col N="586" /> complete control over the banks able to make binding decisions. People do not believe at present that they get fair play from the banks, which do not look after the customer but are only interested in the quarterly returns and how much profit they make.</P>
    <P>Yet, when the banks get into trouble, it is the ordinary taxpayer who helps them as happened to the AIB. There has been little in return from the banks to the taxpayer. The Government has to assist community projects because banks are not prepared to give them the necessary funding, and encourage banks to participate in various schemes which are good for the country, the economy and in the interest of all. Therefore Government should be taking a harder line with the banks, support post offices and credit unions and encourage variety in the market so that the banks have to compete. We would not then have to beg banks to install ATMs in towns such as Newport, Louisburgh and Achill, which need support. We frequently discuss the need to create employment in rural areas, decentralisation and encouraging people to return to rural areas, but financial institutions such as banks pull out the necessary services that exist, remove confidence from those communities and put nothing into them.</P>
    <P>I could understand if the banks were struggling and could not afford to keep these offices open. The banks should be community friendly and not concerned just with making money. Legislation should be in place to compel them to provide a service, even if it does not make a massive profit, because they will make those profits in the bigger towns and cities. The Central Bank should make them provide necessary services in rural areas. I do not say to the banks, Government or the Central Bank that there should be a bank in every little village, but where there is a need and to avoid people travelling 30 miles or more, there should be a bank.</P>
    <P>The banks have got away with much over the years. When AIB had its trouble in America, we were lucky it did not bring down our economy, although it had a major affect on shares. In future legislation, the Minister should give more powers to the post offices and credit unions so there is competition for the banks. They appear to be able to make representations to Government and are looked after by the State, but the consumers need to be protected from them. I hope to see more competition as the banks are getting stronger and the amalgamation between the Bank of Ireland and AIB should be opposed. I want more banks from outside competing in the market so that people will get better prices and be able to borrow money at a cheaper rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is complex and technical in nature. In addition to providing for the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and for the reorganisation and renam<Col N="587" /> ing of the Central Bank, the parliamentary draftsman has also identified and listed the specific enactments and regulations under which the regulatory authority is to perform functions of the bank; amended and restated provisions of the 1942 Central Bank Act; repealed and amended other Acts consequential on the provisions of the Bill; and amended European Communities regulations.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their many contributions to the debate which raised many interesting issues. I would like to respond to the main issues raised by the Deputies and we will have an opportunity to deal with the other matters on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>One of the main issues raised by the Deputies was the proposed structure for the new regulatory authority. The ongoing consolidation within institutional sectors and convergence across categories of financial service providers makes the choice of an appropriate supervisory structure very difficult. These developments have increasingly blurred traditional lines of demarcation among the four pillars of the financial systems, banks insurance companies, pension funds and securities firms, as institutions have sought opportunities to cross-sell products, expand across borders and achieve economies of scale. Financial institutions of all types are increasingly offering products and services, directly or through affiliates, that compete not only against those offered by similar types of institutions but also against those offered by other categories of service providers.</P>
      <P>As regards a supervisory structure, the only thing one can say with certainty is that there is no one model internationally that can be picked off the shelf and put in place.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the Government decided in principle that a single regulatory authority, SRA, for the financial services sector should be established. It asked the Implementation Advisory Group to advise it on the various requirements for such an SRA, including the organisational structure for the authority. The McDowell group noted that the type of structure for such a body has implications for the degree of information that can flow between the prudential regulation and consumer protection functions. Having examined several models for an SRA, the group concluded that, given the requirements imposed by the relevant European Union law, the best mechanism for providing for the maximum flow of information between the two functions is to combine both within one authority. The Bill implements this recommendation.</P>
      <P>In February 2001 the Government approved a memorandum which provided that the new regulatory authority should be established within the new structure of the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Authority. In this regard, the ECB in a recent opinion has welcomed the fact that IFSRA will be a constituent part of the new structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" />I am satisfied this structure will work well because it will provide a one-stop-shop for consumers, business and the financial services industry by having the regulation of insurance banking and credit unions under the one roof; it will facilitate the exchange of information between the twin functions of prudential regulation and consumer protection, as both will be part of the one authority; and it places the interests of consumers at the heart of financial services regulations by giving the authority specific responsibilities in this regard and creating a statutory position of consumer director.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, the McDowell report contained a package of recommendations in regard to financial regulation and consumer protection. This Bill deals mainly with the establishment of IFSRA. I intend to publish a second Bill later this year to implement the remainder of the recommendations contained the McDowell report including establishing a statutory financial services ombudsman; establishing consultation panels of the financial services industry and of consumers; addressing issues arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the Review Group on Auditing; and making provisions arising from a review of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, dealing with confidentiality of Central Bank information.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the amendment tabled by Deputies Burton and McGrath regarding the Second Reading, the basic effect of which would be to delay progress of this Bill pending further study.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of further studies or reviews of financial services supervision, I remind Deputies that this issue has already been heavily studied, as the very detailed report of the McDowell group will attest. It is not correct to say that the McDowell group was prevented by its terms of reference from considering whether consumer protection should be combined with prudential regulation. The group carried out an extensive consultation process, considered the option of consumer protection being dealt with separately and came out against it. I refer the Deputies to paragraph 4.15 of the report. In the final analysis, we have to act, and I am of the opinion that this Bill should be allowed to progress through Second Stage and on to Committee Stage in a prompt and timely manner.</P>
    <P>I have, as Minister, listened carefully to points made by Deputies during this debate and I will give them detailed consideration before moving on to Committee Stage. As further information becomes available about recent financial scandals, I will happily take on board appropriate lessons during the progress of this Bill and the proposed subsequent legislation, but I am firmly of the view that we should not now call a halt to this Bill. Essentially, it is far too late in the day for the Deputies to seek a postponement of the reading of the Bill and I reject the amendment.</P>
    <P>In the course of tabling this amendment, Deputies seem to suggest that there was a ques<Col N="589" /> tion over prudential regulation in Ireland and that it might not be up to the best international standards. The International Monetary Fund, at our request, has carried out a comprehensive review of our financial regulatory system by reference to international best practice. The report &ndash; a summary of which is on the IMF's website &ndash; concluded that our prudential regulatory system complied with established international standards in all respects. The suggestions for improvements that the IMF made have since been addressed by the relevant regulatory authorities.</P>
    <P>Turing to the issue of Allfirst, as I mentioned before in response to questions in this House, the primary responsibility for managing a bank and preventing fraud lies with the management of that institution. No regulatory authority can put in place a supervisory regime to ensure a financial institution can never be a victim of fraudulent activity from within. It is up to the management of the bank, in the first instance, to ensure that its own internal control policies are properly complied with at subsidiary and group level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten asked what is the level of regulatory control in relation to such foreign subsidiaries. It is established international practice that host country regulators supervise local subsidiaries of internationally active banks. The home country regulator of such banks look at the group on a consolidated basis.</P>
    <P>Before an Irish bank is allowed to open a subsidiary abroad the Central Bank requires that it operates in a jurisdiction which has a well established system of financial supervision. It would also establish a relationship with those local supervisors. Co-operation between the home and host country regulators is always a feature of such arrangements.</P>
    <P>Thus, the primary supervision of overseas subsidiaries of Irish banks is carried out by local regulators in the jurisdictions in which they operate, just as the Central Bank supervises Irish subsidiaries of foreign banks. It would therefore be misleading to suggest that this means there is a lack of supervision of Irish banks operating abroad.</P>
    <P>In the particular case of Irish banks operating in the United States of America, where they have been active for many years, the USA has a well developed system of financial regulation. However, the risk of unexpected financial loss cannot be eliminated even by the most advanced systems.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Central Bank to provide a report identifying if its investigation revealed the need for any necessary legislative changes. The initial reaction provided by the Central Bank on 13 March stated that there is no evidence to suggest that the Irish legislative framework contributed to the losses incurred. I await a final report from the Central Bank, which I understand will be received today and if any changes are necessary I will bring them forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As a precaution the Central Bank has formally written to all credit institutions within its remit to <Col N="590" /> re-emphasise the need for compliance with best international standards of management and controls. Moreover, it has asked that there be independent verification that these controls are being operated.</P>
    <P>As regards Enron, many of the issues in that case related to auditing. I have signalled already that the second Bill which I intend to bring forward later this year in relation to financial sector supervision will deal explicitly with audit issues and specifically with implementing the report of the Review Group on Auditing in relation to financial institutions. Once again, this is not an issue which should delay this Bill.</P>
    <P>Turning to the consumer protection issue, Deputies questioned whether the regulatory authority will have a strong consumer focus. I refer the Deputies to page 27 of the Bill, section 33C(3), where it is stated explicitly that the mandate of the regulatory authority is to promote the best interests of users of financial services in a way that is consistent with the orderly and proper functioning of financial markets and with the orderly and prudent supervision of providers of those services.</P>
    <P>The regulatory authority has a strong consumer mandate which derives from two main sources, the general mandate assigned to IFSRA and its consumer director under this legislation and consumer related functions transferred to IFSRA and its consumer director prior to this legislation. Taking these two together, the regulatory authority's consumer mandate encompasses monitoring the supervision of financial services to consumers; monitoring the extent to which competition exists among providers of financial services in so far as it affects consumers of those services; increasing public awareness of the availability, costs, risks and benefits of financial services; issuing and enforcing codes of conduct, regulations, directions etc. to financial services providers in relation to the conditions under which they provide services to customers, that is, advertising, information to customers, terms of contracts, cooling off periods etc.; control and monitoring of customer charges, other than interest rates, imposed by credit institutions and <i>bureaux de change</i>; licensing of moneylenders, including approval of the interest rates charged; compensation arrangements in respect of financial services providers who cannot meet their obligations to customers; and promoting in general the best interests of users of financial services. In addition, the second Bill will provide for an ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints against financial institutions and a consultative panel for consumers of financial services.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the need for the financial sector regulator to play a part in supporting the Revenue Commissioners' enforcement of tax law. It is true that sections 33AK and AL of the present Bill essentially repeat the existing legislative prohibition on regulatory authorities disclosing information that comes to their notice in the course of conducting their prudential over<Col N="591" /> sight of financial institutions. Such confidentiality provisions are also contained in EU legislation which is binding on us as a member state.</P>
    <P>I have been examining these legal provisions, notably in the light of the controversy generated by the revelations of non-compliance by certain financial institutions with their obligations under tax legislation. The general strengthening of corporate governance requirements under recent or planned company law legislation makes it less likely that we will see a repetition of the type of behaviour by financial institutions that led to the DIRT inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts. Nevertheless, I hope to include &ndash; either in the second Bill or in a Committee Stage amendment to this Bill &ndash; provisions that would oblige IFSRA to take action if it came across evidence of wrongdoing by financial institutions under its supervision. I am exploring how this might be done without breaching our obligations under EU law. This would cover cases of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is worth recalling the extensive process of preparation for this Bill. In October 1998, the Government agreed in principle to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector. An expert group was established in November 1998, under the chairmanship of Michael McDowell SC, to advise the Government on the establishment of the authority. The group reported in May 1999 setting out the role and functions of the SRA, the range of financial services providers to be covered by the SRA and the funding of the authority.</P>
    <P>The Government announced in February 2001 the structure for the new authority. The Bill before us essentially implements the Government decision which broadly follows the recommendations contained in the report of the McDowell group. The Bill was published in April of this year and the provisions contained therein have been <Col N="592" /> in the public domain in one form or another since early 1999.</P>
    <P>While I agree with Deputies that it is a complex Bill I do not accept that its contents should come as a surprise to any one. The structures etc. which the Bill aims to establish have been public knowledge for quite a number of years. In the circumstances, I feel that there has been adequate time for all concerned to consider the implications of the proposed structures etc. provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, it is my intention to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage, details of which will be made available to Deputies in advance. I would like to remind Deputies, however, that this Bill is essentially concerned with structures and is part of a package of measures, rather than a stand alone piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the interim board for agreeing to be involved in this important project for the financial services industry and consumers alike. As l stated previously, the board will be assisted by a steering committee and support group, drawn from officials of the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my own Department, to make sure that the chairperson and the interim board have all the support required to enable them to perform the tasks which the interim board was set up to perform.</P>
    <P>An efficient and effective financial services sector is a vital pillar of the economy. I have no doubt that the integrated structure proposed in this Bill, coupled with a continuation of the existing high standards, will be a positive factor in attracting new services and additional investment to Ireland. The objective of our strategy must be to maintain a vibrant and growing financial services industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The second Government action plan on the information society, New Connections, was published in April this year. The plan sets out the Government's strategy to ensure Ireland establishes itself as a leading location for e-business and knowledge based economic activity and that our development as an information society is inclusive. The influence of information and communication technologies is transforming the way we interact and do business. We are faced with new challenges and opportunities across all areas of economic and social policy and it is evident that the pace of this change is without precedent. We are experiencing the single most dynamic shift in the public policy environment in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cross-cutting nature of information society developments is reflected in the range of issues addressed in the action plan. As Minister of State <Col N="596" /> at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for information society issues, it is my role to promote implementation of this agenda. In this capacity, I will be responsible for co-ordinating the work of the Cabinet committee on the information society, for ensuring that information society issues are prioritised across all Departments and for monitoring implementation of the action plan. The key structures in place to support the process are an e-strategy group at Secretary General level and an information society implementation group of Assistant Secretaries.</P>
    <P>The Government appointed a new Information Society Commission last November. The commission is an independent advisory body to the Government and draws on high-level representation from the business community, the social partners and the Government. It will play a key role in shaping the ongoing development of information society policy. I will be responsible for co-ordinating the work of these bodies, supported by the information society policy unit in the Department of the Taoiseach. A key challenge will be to ensure our approach is characterised by the flexibility necessary to remain responsive to the influence of rapidly evolving technologies and the changes they bring about. It is clear that competitive advantage in the knowledge economy will depend on the capacity to respond quickly to new developments in what has become an environment of ongoing change.</P>
    <P>The key provisions in the national development plan to support information society development are in the areas of telecommunications infrastructure, research and development and lifelong learning. The range of initiatives drawing on NDP funding being progressed in these areas is fully reflected in the Government's New Connections action plan. I will liaise closely with the relevant Ministers to support implementation of these initiatives in the context of progressing the overall information society agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first opportunity I have had, may I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his appointment to that position, as well as Deputy Hanafin on her appointment as Minister of State and Government Chief Whip?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin has outlined her role as Minister of State with responsibility for the information society, which seems to involve the co-ordination of various elements of it. Does she agree Ireland is falling behind other developed countries in this area, especially as regards broadband technologies? Will she clarify the Government's plans, as outlined in New Connections, to secure the unbundling of the local loop as quickly as possible and to ensure that digital subscriber line technologies are available nationwide as soon as possible? What form of leadership will be provided by the Minister of State in this area? Does she agree it is not enough merely to co-ordinate, as she should be seen to lead? Leadership is badly needed as we are lagging so badly behind. The <Col N="597" /> Minister of State must drive this matter forward. Does she agree it is important that we promote flat-rate dial-up Internet access? In other words, we should facilitate people who wish to log onto the Internet and stay on-line for free. Is this a priority of the Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be infringing on the responsibility of another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Stanton stated, the Government's vision that telecommunications services should be high-quality, high-speed, affordable and constantly available to all businesses and citizens as soon as possible is clearly set out in New Connections. The implementation of that vision is a matter for a number of different Departments. The implementation and distribution of broadband telecommunications infrastructure rests with the Department of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. My role is to ensure our commitments under the New Connections action plan are met. Many Departments will have a part in ensuring their elements of the plan are implemented, but my role will be to drive the agenda and to ensure we are all working on the same issues at the same time.</P>
      <P>It is crucially important that broadband is made available throughout the country. However, it is not true to say that Ireland lags behind other countries. Reports have shown how far ahead Ireland is. A report being published tomorrow will equally show our success to date in this area. However, to ensure that we remain one of the most globalised countries and remain competitive and, more particularly, to ensure that ordinary people can have access to services in the easiest and cheapest way possible around the clock, we must move forward with this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Straight away there is a difficulty because it appears the Minister of State is not clear what her role is. What exactly is her role? Is she in charge of this area or are other Ministers in charge? Who is answerable to the Dáil in this regard? It is vitally important that we get this right, otherwise we will fall between two stools. Government Ministers will say it is not their responsibility, it is someone else's responsibility. Therefore, I ask the Minister of State and the Taoiseach to ensure there are very clear lines of communication.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister of State to outline what legal and policy frameworks she plans to put in place to support start-ups that might emerge from academic research? This seems to be a weakness down through the years. What improved supports will be in place for new start-ups, particularly in the area of patenting and copyright?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made it clear in my initial answer that my role is a co-ordinating one. Obviously it would be wrong to take away indi<Col N="598" /> vidual responsibilities from individual Departments. As I said, broadband comes under one Department, e-commerce will come under the Tánaiste's Department and educational elements will come under the Department of Education and Science. However, it is important as part of the overall policy to ensure that agenda is driven, which is my role. In doing so, I am backed not just by those different Departments but by the Cabinet sub-committee. That this role is based in the Department of the Taoiseach shows the priority the Government is giving it. The fact that there is a strategy group of secretaries and assistant secretaries and that there is an information society policy unit based in the Department of the Taoiseach will ensure the policy is driven.</P>
      <P>In regard to the legal and regulatory environment, it is necessary that businesses, consumers and so on have the necessary confidence in the whole system. Part of the priority will be new legislation in the whole area of telecommunications regulation in regard to data protection, intellectual property rights and e-government. In regard to research and development, the Deputy will be aware that &euro;2.5 billion has been allocated for that under the technology foresight fund of the national development plan. It is all happening at different levels under various Departments. When it comes to individual questions about individual issues, those Ministers are accountable and responsible and will answer in the Dáil. However, on the issue of e-government and driving the whole agenda, that is my responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>What State agencies are under the Minister of State's remit or under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach in the area of the information society? What is her relationship with REACH, OASIS, Revenue-on-line and so on? Will she be a glorified messenger boy &ndash; I do not mean that in a derogatory fashion &ndash; or will she have a real say in what happens in this area? We need to know who is in charge and who is responsible for the whole area, not just who will co-ordinate matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone would ever accuse me of being a messenger boy or a messenger girl. I know Deputy Stanton was not doing that and it certainly is not my role, nor will it be. My role of co-ordination and implementation is a key role, not just a messenger boy role. I was the Minister who attended the British-Irish Council summit meeting in Jersey last Friday with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the agenda is being driven at that level. That indicates the commitment in the Department of the Taoiseach to drive the issue at this level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On State agencies, there are no State agencies within my remit. However, officials from the information society policy unit within the Department of the Taoiseach are on some of the boards mentioned to ensure that agenda is driven. I have met the Information Society Commission which <Col N="599" /> is the body set up to advise and help in the implementation of this policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State's office been in touch with the Central Statistics Office in regard to the question in the recent census on the number of households that have Internet access and home computers and whether that information will be supplied on a small area statistic basis to identify particular geographical areas that have good, average or poor take-up of information technology? In terms of liaising with the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, what efforts will the Minister's office make to tackle the problem whereby both Internet access and on-line charges in Ireland are among the highest in Europe and are one of the debilitating factors in ensuring Irish people and Irish households have full access to information technology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>My responsibilities include Chief Whip, the Information Society, Minister of State at the Department of Defence and the Central Statistics Office. Therefore, it will be easy for me to keep in contact with them and get the information. The information gained from the census will be very valuable, particularly in attracting private investment to that area. Once the level of use in a geographical area is known, it will assist us to back up our own investment on a private public partnership basis so that we can do exactly what Deputy Boyle has said to ensure broadband is more readily and cheaply accessible throughout the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Stanton that the role of the co-ordinator is crucial to the development of this service throughout the country. The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has ambitious plans to extend broadband and new technology to peripheral and Gaeltacht areas and the islands. We applaud him for that and hope it will be successful. Has the Minister of State had meetings with her colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, in regard to extending this service to peripheral areas of the west and the islands or does she intend holding meetings with the Minister to co-ordinate their plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to meet each of the Ministers with responsibility in this area, particularly in the context of ensuring that each of them progresses his or her responsibilities in the new connections agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP" hpid="Mr. Gogarty Mr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister of State's liaison with the Minister for Education and Science, is there a clear Government policy to increase investment in information technology in schools? I understand a number of projects have been initiated by the Department of Education and Science such as award for learning. To my know<Col N="600" /> ledge this has received a mixed response because it seems like the imposition of a US style system into an Irish system of education. Are there plans to ensure every primary school in the country will have IT literate students by the time they leave sixth class?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that during the lifetime of the last Government there was major progress on the IT for schools scheme whereby every school has Internet access. That decision was taken by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin. This is the best way to ensure all children, irrespective of their background, have access to the Internet. That was widely hailed in Europe at the time as being very farsighted and, listening to my colleagues from other countries on Friday, it appears that we are well ahead of other states in this regard. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is also committed to ensuring that it is expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government have a time-scale to secure the unbundling of the local loop and to enable always-on dial-up Internet access? Is there a target date against which to measure the ambitious plans the Minister has outlined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the targets for new connections are based on a three-year plan. By 2005 we should have the main elements in place, which will also include the access to public services and to e-government. The new connection plan is a three year one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include flat-rate dial-up Internet access nationally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>That question would be best addressed to the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Ironically, I was going to ask about the Internet flat rate. Is it the Minister's intention to ensure that Irish businesses are not at a disadvantage in relation to the cost of Internet access? At present they are at a disadvantage compared to our neighbours in the UK and Europe, particularly in relation to flat-rate access for businesses that happen to be on the Internet all day, most days. Is it the intention of the Government to ensure in a reasonable time frame that we are at least on a par with the UK and the rest of Europe regarding cost of Internet usage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, the Government wants to see the availability of affordable, open access, always-on broadband infrastructure. The word &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; is crucial to the progress of the information society and that will be addressed over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="601" />
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I was going to ask has been partly addressed by Deputy Coveney. What is the position with regard to the Border region? There is a major delay in getting high-quality contract broadband into the region and I would like to know if consultation is taking place with our colleagues across the Border, or, if not, whether the Minister intends to enter into that to ensure that the Border area will not be disadvantaged any further.</P>

Money was allocated by the previous Minister with responsibility for this area, which will be rolled out over the next few years. As I already indicated, on Friday there was a great deal of communication among all the members of the British-Irish Council, which includes colleagues from Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Next week at one of the North-South meetings this matter will also be on the agenda and the Deputy can rest assured that all possible co-operation will take place. Deputy Stanton's question might better be addressed to the individual Ministers who will be responsible for financing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>On 15 July 1998, the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and include Clancy Barracks, Dublin. The sale of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council in conjunction with the IDA for &euro;973,889 has been completed. The sale to the North-Eastern Health Board of the property at Castleblaney for &euro;761,843 has been completed also.</P>
      <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for &euro;380,921, all for local community purposes. I also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for &euro;8,888,167. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly.</P>
      <P>The integrated action area plan, commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the former Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, has been adopted by Cork County Council. Lisneys were appointed as selling agents and the property was advertised for sale by public tender. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 7 June 2002 and the tenders for the property are under consideration. A decision will be made in the near future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing that for asylum seekers. I also agreed to provide about one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. Kildare County Council has requested that the term be extended and the matter is being examined in my Department at present. In relation to the remainder of this site, I am arranging early discussions with all the interested parties including the local authority. My Department has accepted an offer for the sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin, but a contract of sale has not, as yet, been completed. I have no plans to close any further barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to his old portfolio at An Roinn Cosanta. Mark Twain's remark is appropriate in that rumours of the Minister's demise were grossly exaggerated. We are glad to see the Minister back in his old area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already committed himself to no further closures of Army barracks while he is at the Department, but have any recommendations of further closures been made that he has considered and rejected? What has happened to the staff that were assigned to the barracks? Have they been transferred to other parts of the country or to other areas in the same counties? What <Col N="603" /> has happened to the staff at Castleblayney? Are they still in Monaghan? The Minister said that some have probably retired or made redundant, but have the rest stayed in the Border area?</P>
    <P>Six barracks have been closed and two have yet to be sold. Can the Minister indicate the total savings made as a result of these closures, apart from the sale price?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not received any proposals in connection with the possibility of future closures from any source, but if Deputy McGinley were interested in making a few, I would certainly be prepared to listen. Such matters are not on the agenda.</P>
      <P>In the case of Castleblayney, there were some retirements and transfers to Dundalk and Monaghan. The same applied in Fermoy from where a small number were transferred to Killworth and the vast majority to Collins Barracks in Cork. Virtually all staff at Ballincollig were transferred to Collins Barracks and staff from Naas went primarily to the Curragh Camp, as did those from Magee Barracks. The staff of Clancy Barracks went to the Curragh Camp and to Cathal Brugha Barracks and McKee Barracks here in Dublin. All the staff were accommodated as close as possible to their new installation. The overall saving, apart from the sale price, in terms of military security allowances is approximately &euro;1.5 million. There are considerable savings in terms of general services such as electricity, telephones and general maintenance. I do not have an exact figure but day-to-day savings are roughly between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million, apart from the value of the sales to the Department in terms of enhancing my ability to purchase new equipment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in all cases. When the decision was taken, it was envisaged that it would take a few years to complete the sales and the Department of Finance agreed to provide funds up front in anticipation of drawing down the funds which would accrue from the sales. In other words, funds were available to us before the sales took place on foot of that expectation.</P>

      <P>I would like once again to pay tribute to Private Peadar Ó Flaithearta who died on 15 April 2002 while on service with the former <Col N="604" /> UN mission in East Timor, the United Nations transitional administration in East Timor. I again invite the House to join me in expressing sincere sympathy to his family on their sad and tragic loss.</P>
      <P>Following the death of Private Ó Flaithearta, three separate investigations into the circumstances surrounding his death were commenced &ndash; New Zealand military police investigation; Irish military police investigation; and Irish Defence Forces court of inquiry. I understand from the military authorities that the New Zealand military police investigation, which arises because the Irish contingent serving in East Timor forms part of the New Zealand battalion, has been completed. The other two investigations are ongoing. The Defence Forces court of inquiry is expected to complete its investigations by mid-July.</P>
      <P>A United Nations board of inquiry into Private Ó Flaithearta's death is scheduled to take place but it will only commence following completion of the Defence Forces court of inquiry.</P>

      <P>It is important that the effort put in by the Defence Forces overseas is recognised in terms of the image they create for Ireland. I offer the sympathy and condolences of the Labour Party to the Ó Flaithearta family, the Minister and his Department, the Defence Forces and especially to the soldiers who were with Private Ó Flaithearta on the occasion in question following this tragic loss. This young man was starting out on his career in the Defence Forces and he wanted to play a major role in overseas missions. I am pleased the investigations are ongoing and it is right and proper that the Minister should inform the House regarding the current position of those investigations.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Wall and McGinley for their kind words about me and, more particularly, for their expressions of sympathy to the Ó Flaithearta family. One needs to have the experience of seeing the Defence Forces in action under the mandate of the United Nations in war-torn parts of the world to fully appreciate the work they do and the sacrifices they make. In this case a tragic accident led to Peadar Ó Flaithearta's most untimely death. It is a telling reminder, notwithstanding whatever resources are provided to ensure the security and protection of our soldiers abroad, that accidents can happen and they cause enormous trauma for the families concerned and the Defence Forces as a whole. Though one cannot give a 100% guarantee, we do everything we can to ensure, through provisions of this House, that everything humanly possible is done to protect soldiers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On 17 January 2002 I authorised my Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky International Operations, Inc., Connecticut, USA, for the purchase of three medium range helicopters &ndash; S-92s &ndash; for search and rescue purposes. The negotiations were also to include an option exercisable within three years by the Department for a further two helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
      <P>The decision followed a detailed examination of the original tenders received from four companies &ndash; Sikorsky, USA; CHC Scotia, Scotland; EH Industries Ltd., UK; and Eurocopter, France &ndash; and an examination of the best and final prices submitted by the four companies in December 2001.</P>
      <P>I decided to seek best and final prices from each of the four tenders because of the expiration of the validity of all tenders and taking into account the changed international situation following the terrible events of 11 September. None of the best and final price submissions from the four companies made reference to objections the companies may have had with the use of this procedure and neither did they indicate that their submissions were made without prejudice to such objections.</P>
      <P>Following the submission and examination of the best and final prices, I deemed that the offer from Sikorsky was the most strategically and economically advantageous tender taking account of the award criteria set out for the tender competition, which were functional characteristics; technical merit; all maintenance and on-line technical support; after sales service and warranty terms on offer; cost and ready availability of spare parts; tender prices; and life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period. I was satisfied on the basis of the facts presented to me that the offer from Sikorsky would provide best value for money from the taxpayers' point of view.</P>
      <P>Following on from my decision of 17 January 2002, Eurocopter instituted judicial review proceedings contesting the decision to open negotiations with Sikorsky. The matter is due for mention in the High Court next Monday, 24 June. I assure the House that I am doing everything I can to expedite the completion of the contract with Sikorsky and to have the new helicopters delivered to the Air Corps at the earliest date.</P>

Has the formal contract yet been signed by Sikorsky for the purchase of the helicopters? Will <Col N="606" /> the impending High Court case delay the purchase? Has the Minister plans to overcome such a delay given the urgent need to have the helicopters delivered as soon as possible?</P>

      <P>I share Deputy McGinley's concern regarding the need for early delivery of the search and rescue helicopters. We are anxious that the options open to me are taken to speed up delivery. I am, as the Deputy will appreciate, restricted by the judicial review proceedings, which will proceed on 24 June. It is not possible to sign contracts pending the outcome of the proceedings. In the meantime it is being ensured the best arrangements are made for search and rescue services though civil contracts for the entire country.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that we are also looking at the leasing of aircraft for the north-west. The delay is unfortunate and is not something that I can control. I have sought to initiate some diplomatic moves in order to deal with this matter more expeditiously but this has not been successful as yet. This matter is before the courts and this limits my capacity to intervene in any way, but obviously I am concerned at the delay.</P>

I have first-hand experience of the excellent work being carried out by the air and sea rescue services. They are always willing to provide a service of mercy flights to the islanders of Donegal. I ask the Minister to convey my gratitude and that of my constituents to the Air Corps for the excellent service which it provides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that while on a military exercise in the Curragh area on Monday evening, 22 April 2002, a traffic accident occurred involving two Mowag armoured personnel carriers. The accident happened at 5.50 p.m. on the N78, Kilcullen &ndash; Athy road.</P>
      <P>The military authorities are conducting a routine traffic accident investigation into the incident to establish the facts. The investigation is ongoing. No other civil or military vehicles were involved in the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of seven military personnel in the APCs were taken by the emergency services to Naas <Col N="607" /> hospital for examination. One member was detained overnight in hospital and is still receiving medical treatment. I wish him a speed recovery. The other members were released on the day.</P>
    <P>The two APCs were recovered to the vehicle base workshops in the Curragh Camp for a technical examination. Mechanical repairs were made in the workshops to one of the APCs and it is now back in service.</P>
    <P>Due to the specialist nature of the repairs which could not be effected in the Curragh Camp, the other APC has been returned to Mowag in Switzerland for repairs. The estimated cost of the repairs by Mowag is in the region of &euro;50,000. They are being carried out at present and the vehicle will be returned to Ireland to be put back into service at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>A newspaper report on the accident stated that the hydraulically operated rear ramp was damaged and seized up. The ramp is designed to allow personnel to escape from the vehicle and I am worried that if the ramp seized up it would prejudice the safety of the personnel. This calls into question the safety of the Mowag carrier if the mechanism which is designed to allow personnel to disembark becomes seized.</P>

I am aware that a crash involving two powerful mechanical vehicles can do considerable damage.

If the investigation of this accident uncovers any information which puts the operation of the vehicle in any doubt, it will be investigated immediately.</P>

I am concerned about the safety of the vehicle considering it had to be returned to the manufacturers for repair as a result of this accident.</P>

      <P>In July last year, the Government approved the drafting of an Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill, similar to a general scheme of a Bill presented to Government. In January 2002, the draft text of the Bill was submitted to Government and was approved for publication and circulated to Deputies. Unfortunately, due to pressing time constraints, the Bill did not proceed further prior to the end of the last Dáil session.

There was a certain amount of disappointment among those involved that it was not passed during the lifetime of the last Dáil. Will the Minister give the House an estimate of when the Bill will come before the House? Will the Minister indicate if the concerns of the representative associations will be incorporated in the new Bill?

      <P>There are ongoing discussions with the representative associations in connection with any potential amendments which could be considered before this comes back to the House. These are being addressed at present. Regarding the timescale, I hope this passes through both Houses before the end of the year so that the ombudsman for the Defence Forces office would be fully in place by the beginning of 2003. It is important to realise that this is an historic move and the Deputy is right in that there was some disappointment that we did not have everything completed. We have a complaints procedure in place which will work well in the future because not every single grievance will go to the ombudsman &ndash; the normal channels of complaint will be open to the Defence Forces. When those are exhausted and someone considers that they have been treated unreasonably the ombudsman will then be necessary. It will be before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The last Administration made a determined effort to try to address what was a very difficult situation given that the Defence Forces were poorly equipped and it tried to address that in a systematic way. Considerable progress has been made on all fronts &ndash; the acquisition of ships for the Navy as well as the acquisition of armoured personnel carriers and a range of other equipment. Regarding new equipment, it is not likely that the Estimate for the Defence Forces will increase in future in the context of the pressure on public finances as well as the demands of health, education and other areas. We will be fighting as hard as we can to maintain a sufficient level of investment but I do not envisage a substantial increase in the future regarding the purchase of new equipment.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on Ireland's preparations for participation in the EU's rapid reaction force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to bring Members up to date on the important work <Col N="610" /> that is ongoing both at EU level and in Ireland in relation to the development of a capability to carry out humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks known as the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki Headline Goal, which is the more accurate description of what is commonly referred to as the rapid reaction force, was developed in the light of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which was approved in Ireland by referendum in May 1998 and derives from the decisions taken by European Heads of State and Government at the subsequent EU Councils.</P>
      <P>In this regard, in December 1999 the Helsinki European Council set the headline goal in terms of military capabilities. For the EU, this means being able by the year 2003 to deploy within 60 days and sustain for at least one year up to 60,000 persons capable of carrying out the full range of Petersberg Tasks. It must be emphasised that the achievement of this goal does not involve the establishment of a European army. The commitment and deployment of national troops will be based on sovereign decisions taken by member states.</P>
      <P>The ability to carry out Petersberg Tasks will effectively complement existing EU diplomatic, social and economic capabilities. An example of the way in which the EU might successfully employ these capabilities is illustrated by the great progress which has been made in restoring regional stability in the former Yugoslavia since the deployment of the UN authorised NATO-led multinational stabilisation and security forces SFOR and KFOR and which has been underscored by the EU's Stability Pact for SouthEastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The Spanish Presidency of the EU has been carrying forward work in this area and it will report on progress at the Seville Council which is due to take place next weekend. While I do not wish to pre-empt the Presidency report, I expect that it will further reflect the ongoing development of co-operation between EU members to voluntarily undertake humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks. Ireland's commitment to the headline goal consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, or UNSAS. This represents some 10% of our army &ndash; not an inconsiderable undertaking by any standard.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information:</i>Ireland's contribution of professional expertise and experience gained from many years of participation on United Nations missions represents a pragmatic and worthy progression of our international peacekeeping tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces preparation for participation in the EU Helsinki Headline Goal involves the establishment, by the end of 2003, of a military capability that could be made available <Col N="611" /> for Petersberg Task operations consisting of an infantry battalion, 750, a platoon of special forces, 40, a national support element, 30, augmentees, 14, military observers, ten, and a press-media group of six. The necessary Defence Force training plan is in place and progressing satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that national sovereignty is a fundamental underlying principle to participation in the European security and defence policy and Ireland will approach each proposed mission on a case by case basis. We will only participate in operations authorised by the United Nations as comprehended by the appropriate legislation &ndash; the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. This means that each mission will require the approval of the Government and the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the ongoing debate within the EU on how the rapid reaction force is likely to be funded, I understand an agreement of sorts has been reached in the last week and that Ireland has committed itself to sharing costs on the non-military aspects of military operations. Such costs would include the headquarters for EU-led operations, transport, administration and the hiring of local personnel. Does the Minister know or has his Department worked out how such costs will impact on our defence budget on an annual basis? Am I right in saying that Ireland must bear those costs in relation to any military operation conducted from such a European headquarters even if we decide not to participate in such an operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been ongoing debate in the EU as to where costs should finally lie. The Irish position has been consistent, that each country meets its own costs.</P>
      <P>Regarding the possibility that some costs relating to certain aspects of this development might be shared, I am not aware of a final decision being taken on that as yet. As I said, our stance is very strong on the basis of every country sharing its own costs. I have no estimate because it would be impossible to anticipate what the future holds in this regard. In the first instance we would not become involved unless there was a UN mandate and we would have to come back to the Dáil. Each case would have to be examined on its own merits and there are strict limitations to what we could afford in any case. As I explained earlier to Deputy McGinley, we have had an ongoing acquisition of equipment for the Defence Forces and we are unlikely to be making provision for substantial change in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of the command structure of the rapid reaction force. Annex 7 of the Presidency report on the Treaty of Nice refers to relationships between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the European Union, opening the possibility of an EU operation being <Col N="612" /> put in the hands of NATO. The British Prime Minister spoke to his Parliament about such a possibility.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister responds I will take a final question from Deputy McGinley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome our participation in the Rapid Reaction Force, will it involve the training of Irish troops abroad on foreign soil and, if so, will a constitutional amendment or new legislation be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McGinley, the White Paper prescribes and defines the type of training envisaged for the Defence Forces which primarily takes place here in Ireland. There are some instances where co-operative efforts are made so that when faced with service abroad the capacity of the Defence Forces to deal in consort with others is enhanced. We have had very little opportunity for exercises of that kind.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Boyle's question, it is important to realise that the decision making process lies at political level in the EU. Regarding NATO, the best I could do is to invite the Deputy to join me sometime to view the work in Bosnia-Herzegovinia and Kosovo, where there is a NATO led operation under a UN mandate with Irish participation under that mandate, and see how peace has been restored. The question of whether we get involved here is decided by the politicians. Whether there would be involvement with NATO in terms of its transport and other facilities to facilitate development taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovinia and Kosovo is a matter for decision by the EU at senior political level.</P>

The expectation that this aircraft will be available is a morale booster. There are training considerations for new aircraft which would be ongoing if we were moving faster. At the same time we are advertising for trainer aircraft and work is taking place in terms of leasing in the context of search and rescue. We are trying to compensate for this delay by concentrating on other important areas for the Air Corps.</P>

      <P>I have raised on numerous occasions in the House and on Defence Estimate debates, Magee Barracks in Kildare. The Minister has stated again today that he will enter into negotiations with the local authority, Kildare County Council, and also representative groups from the Kildare area. During the Defence Estimate debate, the Minister undertook to immediately enter into these negotiations. However the general election intervened, otherwise we would not be here today. The importance of this matter cannot be over estimated in relation to Kildare town. The development plan for that area is progressing. I ask the Minister and his officials to enter into meaningful negotiations with the local authority and the representative groups on this matter. As the Minister is aware and has stated on a number of occasions, the value of the site to the town cannot be over emphasised.</P>

      <P>In all cases, as I explained in reply to an earlier question, it will be clear that the first option was given to another Department or to the local authority. In Fermoy, first option was given to the IDA and the county council, in Castleblayney it was given to the health board and in Naas it was given to the urban council. Even though around 15% of the areas have been ceded free gratis to the local community, regard must be had to the valuation placed on the property. Given that I have a responsibility to return to the State the investment which the taxpayer made over the years I have to have regard for the valuation placed on the building, premises or land and also the consideration that this money is necessary for the purchase of equipment for the Defence Forces. Otherwise that money would have to be drawn down from the taxpayer. The first offer is to the local community, local authority and Departments of State and the remaining <Col N="615" /> part of the lands, etc. goes to the highest bidder in the interest of the Defence Forces and the taxpayer.

      <P>I invited Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, to chair an external advisory committee to determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures and to make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this area. She was joined by two other civilian experts and by senior military personnel.</P>
      <P>Dr. Doyle and the external advisory committee group presented their completed report to me in March, 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have accepted fully the report and its recommendations. The report notes that it will be essential that external civilian expertise be involved throughout the implementation process for the various recommendations. On the evidence of the research findings, there is a need for immediate action on a number of fronts. As an immediate initial step in implementing these recommendations I have therefore established the independent monitoring group recommended in the report. The monitoring group is chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle, and comprises the Deputy Chief of Staff  &ndash; Support &ndash; an assistant secretary of my Department and the general secretaries of the associations. The group will oversee the drawing up and implementation of a plan to give effect to the fundamental reforms which the report has recommended. In addition, an equality steering group, as recommended by the report, will be established and chaired by a member of the Labour Court. I know that we will <Col N="616" /> have the active support and participation of the representative associations in this exercise.</P>
    <P>As an immediate measure, a confidential helpline was made available to members of the Defence Forces from 5 April 2002. An extensive programme of briefings for members of the Defence Forces has been set in train.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the report must now be comprehensively built into the general employee relations and human resources management system across and through all ranks and all services and corps of the Defence Forces. The report emphasises the need for continuous external review, including a further external survey in Spring 2004 which will involve a thorough revisiting of all the aspects covered in the current report. That second review process in 2004 will also be undertaken for official publication. The monitoring group has met on a number of occasions to formulate proposals on how best to proceed with implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces fully recognise that the singular nature of the military environment does not give anyone a licence for bullying or harassment of any kind. There is absolutely nothing in military life which requires that any individual be singled out, victimised or subjected to abuse or bullying. Bullying does not constitute training for any aspect of military life. On the contrary, a team spirit is essential to the maintenance of a military organisation and will be undermined by such practices. Such behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. I am pleased to note the advisory committee is already moving on implementation of the report.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister received representations regarding the new helpline and have any new cases of bullying or sexual harassment been identified in the past couple of months? Do we have the required personnel to operate such a helpline? Is the helpline operated by Army personnel or by private consultants?</P>

    <P>I have not received any further reports or complaints. We regard this matter as extremely serious. There is no place in the Defence Forces for bullying, harassment or discrimination of any kind. The report is comprehensive and contains substantial recommendations, all of which have been agreed. We will monitor the implementation of those recommendations on a strict basis in the next two years. I am looking forward to not hearing complaints of that nature in the future. I have received a full commitment from the Chief of Staff to ensure everybody, particularly those in authority, understands the role they have to play in this regard. It is very important from the point <Col N="617" /> of view of job satisfaction, future recruitment and stability in the Defence Forces that any such incidences be eradicated and committed to the past.</P>

      <P>It is wrong to think all the claims involved were associated with the operation of poor safety procedures. Nonetheless, mistakes were made. The Deputy can be assured that the procedures now in place, the equipment available and the expertise in management in dealing with such matters will ensure we are not faced with such problems in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that an updated Defence Forces personnel management plan would be prepared setting down policies and goals to ensure personnel policies and practices keep pace with current best practice to the benefit of the new organisation being created on foot of the white paper.</P>
      <P>In line with this requirement, a draft integrated personnel management system, IPMS, has been prepared by the military authorities and is now being considered by my Department's civil-military strategic management committee. The new career development plan will be encompassed by the IPMS. When the strategic management committee has completed its deliberations, I expect a further draft of the IPMS will be submitted to me for consideration.</P>
      <P>Before any final decisions are made, it is my intention that the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, will be consulted in a spirit of partnership in accordance with the system of representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirements which the IPMS must meet are set out in section 4.5 of the White Paper. In simple terms, the IPMS will deal with the broad range of personnel and human resource management and development issues. These include manpower policy and planning, equality of opportunity and treatment and the right to dignity at work, recruitment, terms of enlistment, induction, training education and development, physical and medical fitness, career guidance and management and development, promotion, the regulatory framework, retirement and pensions. From the range of issues I have outlined, it will <Col N="619" /> be clear to the Deputy and the House that the IPMS is a major undertaking. We are trying to strike a balance between the needs of the organisation and the needs of the people in it.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have a set of finalised proposals to put to the representative associations by the end of the year. The pace of implementation will then depend on how quickly we can complete the consultation process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the preparation of the integrated management system, is the Minister saying that no meetings have yet taken place with the representative associations? Is he waiting until the package has been agreed by his Department before he enters into negotiations or have they had an input in preparing the ground work before being presented to the Minister's Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I received the draft plan from the Chief of Staff some months ago and that is being considered now by the Strategic Management Committee. The consultation will take place when we are closer to a final draft position. The representative associations are, in the main, live activists in the Defence Forces at all levels and they would be acutely aware of the different aspects that go into the preparation of a plan of this kind because it covers such a wide range of activity in the Defence Forces, but the consultation process will not take place until some time in the autumn.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the cost to the Defence Forces of attaining interoperability with NATO forces which have common membership of PfP above and beyond the Irish peacekeeping role with the UN.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13743/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's approach to participation in Partnership for Peace was set out in our Presentation Document of 1 December 1999, which outlined the following five priority areas for involvement: co-operation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment; and co-operation in marine matters. These areas relate to the Defence Forces and to appropriate civilian agencies such as the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, the former Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Civil Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in PfP activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation. To date, the Defence Forces have continued to participate in PfP partnership programmes and the PfP Planning and Review Process, PARP, with a view to enhancing interoperability with our PfP partners. The aim is to create the conditions in which <Col N="620" /> different contingents can work together efficiently and effectively in peace support operations.</P>
    <P>The details of Ireland's participation are set out in our two individual partnership programmes, IPPs, the first of which covered the period up to 31 December 2001 and the second of which covers the period 2002-03. Both of the IPPs have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library. Activities consist of training courses, seminars, workshops, conferences and table top exercises and are attended by representatives of the relevant agencies which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The cost of participation in the 2001 IPP to the Defence Forces was approximately &euro;300,000 and it is anticipated the cost will be the same for 2002. These costs are made up of expenditures on course fees, travel costs and subsistence allowances for Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    <P>The training opportunities provided by Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace enhances the development of the Defence Forces, consistent with the objectives of the Government White Paper on Defence published in February 2000. In addition, participation in Partnership for Peace provides a forum whereby Ireland can contribute to the benefits gained from our many years of successful participation on United Nations humanitarian missions. The experience of our Defence Forces in this area is highly appreciated by the other 45 member countries of Partnership for Peace, particularly the newly emerging democracies of eastern Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response. The Minister outlined the costs of training exercises, conferences etc. and said that the programmes have been placed in the Oireachtas Library, but he did not outline the costs of upgrading weaponry to make it compatible with that of other forces taking part in PfP. Has the Department engaged in such an exercise and, if so, has it come up with the costings involved in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and it is not likely that will take place in Partnership for Peace. The benefits we have gained from our experience in the United Nations are being transmitted to other countries and some of the emerging democracies in eastern Europe are very interested in that. Peacekeeping and crisis management is evolving in the sense that we know many skills are needed for the type of intervention necessary to bring about and maintain peace. We have particular strengths which we can share with others and others have strengths from which we can gain. The White Paper spells out the programme in terms of the purchase of equipment and we have been involved in getting the armoured personnel carriers, ships etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also night vision, engineering and various other types of equipment which the Chief of Staff has sought and these are on the production line, so to speak, but our participation in PfP was <Col N="621" /> not something we envisaged in terms of requiring a different type of equipment from what we had been purchasing in line with the White Paper and our work in the UN generally. It is more to do with the cohesiveness necessary to bridge some of the gaps exposed in the past when different contingents had different ways of doing things which, rather than solve the particular conflict, may have added to it because they did not have the right type of synergy to deal with it. It is in that area that we expect to benefit rather than from any expense account that will arise for us in terms of equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle" hpid="Mr. Boyle Mr. Boyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to command structures for Partnership for Peace, would such command structures be of a permanent or semi-permanent nature? Would they involve personnel from the Irish Army? I am thinking in terms of the situation that has developed in relation to the rapid reaction force where named personnel have been given such positions. If Irish Army personnel are involved in such command structures on either a permanent or semi-permanent basis, what would happen in the event of Ireland deciding to enter into or opt out of any given military situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been fortunate in the past to have senior personnel in the Defence Forces who were invited to take up senior positions, principally under a UN mandate, in different parts of the world. Wherever those opportunities arise, that expertise is available to help bring about peace and to share the experience we have gained wherever that is deemed necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 48, 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Defence Forces by service as at 31 May 2002 was as follows: Army &ndash; 8,669, Air Corps &ndash; 917 and Naval Service &ndash; 975. A more detailed breakdown of these figures by rank category is provided in the tabular statements which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The White Paper sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. In addition the Chief of Staff has discretion to have 250 recruits in training at any given time, over and above this figure of 10,500.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces in the year 2002 to fill vacancies as required. I launched the Defence Forces 2002 general service recruiting campaign last February which has been followed by national and local media advertising.</P>

      <P>I understand the combined total of the various elements of the Defence Forces is 10,500 as the Minister has stated. Given the increased demands on the Defence Forces at home as well as their international obligations, is the Minister satisfied this level of personnel is sufficient to meet the demands? The total is much lower now than the figure of 13,000 or 14,000 in <Col N="623" /> recent years. In this context, I ask the Minister if there are plans to initiate a new recruitment campaign to increase the numbers?</P>

      <P>I had a torrid experience some years ago trying to get agreement on numbers in the Defence Forces which were then enshrined in the White Paper. A stop-go situation had existed whereby recruitment was carried out in some years but not in others and humps were created in the service over time. We wanted to have the clear-cut position of having 10,500 personnel in total with the discretion of 250 in training. The savings accruing from the reduction in numbers were to be primarily used for equipping and updating the equipment of the Defence Forces so we had a professional, highly qualified and motivated force which was smaller in number but better equipped and better able to undertake functions as required by the Government at home or on UN-mandated missions abroad. I am afraid that, having gone through that trauma and taken the rap at the time and having developed a firm and definite position for the future, I am not of a mind to look for additional resources and revisit that process. The complement is consistent and solid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a military board, the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the recommendations of the reserve steering group. I established the special steering group in 1998 to undertake a study of the reserve and the group reported to me in September 1999. Under the aegis of the military board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have advised that the process of formulating revised structures for the Reserve Defence Force is nearing completion and I have been advised that I will receive a copy of the draft Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board report from the Chief of Staff very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restruc<Col N="624" /> tured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>How many people are currently in the FCA? In this context, do the new proposals match the proposals to align the new Reserve Defence Force with the Permanent Defence Force in terms of the three brigade structure? Is another recruitment drive necessary or are there sufficient numbers to meet demands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The blueprint is for an Army Reserve with a total strength in the region of 12,000. One element, comprising 2,656 personnel, will provide people who will integrate with the PDF units to bring them to full operational strength and the other element of 9,300 personnel will provide an overall Army Reserve for the PDF. We have a dedicated Naval Service Reserve &ndash; Slua Muirí &ndash; of about 400.</P>
      <P>It is reasonably close to the numbers we already have even though there is some doubt as to exact numbers. About 9,000 participated in training exercise last year and there are indications that there could be 3,000 or 4,000 who were unavailable for some reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if one examines the geographical spread, there are some areas which are very poorly represented so we need to target our cities and other parts of the country with recruitment programmes. The challenges include changing economic circumstances, less free time, employment opportunities, a diminution of the voluntary ethos and greater materialism which make <Col N="625" /> recruitment a struggle, but there is confidence that we can surmount these obstacles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On 23 April 1996 the Government approved the establishment of a dedicated Garda Air Support Unit as recommended in the report of the Interdepartmental Group on Air Support for the Garda Síochána. The service provided through the Garda Air Support Unit, which was inaugurated in September 1997, comprises Garda Síochána and Air Corps personnel and operates from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. The Garda Síochána is responsible for the operational control and policing functions, while Air Corps personnel have responsibility for the flying and maintenance functions of the service. Two aircraft are operated by the Air Corps on behalf of the Garda Síochána, one twin engine AS355N Squirrel helicopter and one Defender 4000 fixed wing aircraft. On 10 November 1998 the Government approved the acquisition of a second twin engine helicopter with a 24 hour capability for the GASU. This new helicopter &ndash; an EC 135 &ndash; is due for delivery in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The question of night flying capacity has been the subject of ongoing communication between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for some time. To facilitate an effective programme of training, which would not impinge on the ongoing GASU operation, I announced in February 2000 that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of the GASU. Work began in my Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on 22 May 2000, a request for tender issued for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355 F2 helicopter. To date, despite best efforts, it has not proven possible to acquire the appropriate helicopter due to the lack of a suitable aircraft in the marketplace. However, efforts in this regard are ongoing.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that a training programme for night operations is being developed in conjunction with the introduction into service of the new EC 135.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately there are two options. One is for the Garda to employ private <Col N="626" /> pilots, the other is for the Air Corps to provide that service in conjunction with the Garda as pertains currently. The Air Corps provide that service in conjunction with the Garda and that is the way it is working at present. The Garda is in charge of commanding what is done but the Air Corps is in charge of the management and piloting of the aircraft itself. It is operated harmoniously between the two distinct forces.</P>

      <P>On the night of 27 November 2001, a progression course from two to three star private ranking was under way in the Glen of Imaal. A number of personnel were instructed to fire blank ammunition during the course of the exercise. During the exercise a number of live rounds of ammunition were accidentally discharged. The injured private received bullet wounds to his arm and chest. A military ambulance was on site and the injured party was immediately treated by a qualified emergency medical technician. The injured private was then transferred to Tallaght Hospital and subsequently to St. James's Hospital, where he underwent treatment. The injured private is still under medical care.</P>
      <P>Military Police were immediately called to the scene and carried out a full investigation. They recently submitted their report to the Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations), who is currently examining the report. Pending the final outcome of the investigation, arrangements have been put in place to ensure that a recurrence of the events of 27 November does not take place.</P>

      <P>Seriously, ongoing discussions are taking place at a number of levels, up to ministerial level. Following the events of 11 September, discussion sometimes takes place between Ministers outside of the meeting format, as the Deputy will appreciate. As chairperson of the Government's emergency planning unit I am aware of the concerns that people have in the aftermath of events in America. The intelligence services of various countries have to co-operate to ensure that risks and dangers to society can be properly assessed. The best possible plans must be put in place, first at national level and then in co-operation with our colleagues across the world. People who intend to carry out atrocities in various parts of the world constitute a serious threat to today's society. In order to face down this threat, we must remain in contact and co-operation with our colleagues. There can never be a 100% guarantee of safety, but I assure the Deputy that I am not waiting for a call &ndash; I am constantly working in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I wish to begin by congratulating you on your election to this House. I pay tribute to your term as Ceann Comhairle during a period when I was not a Member of this House. However, I did have the privilege of seeing how well you discharged your <Col N="629" /> functions, as I watched you on the television in the offices of the Attorney General. I also wish to congratulate Deputy Deasy on his election to the Dáil, and on his nomination as party spokesman for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>This Bill was presented to the previous Dáil on 3 April 2002 by my predecessor in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O'Donoghue. The Bill is relatively short but it is, nevertheless, most important. It deals with an area of great public concern to ordinary law-abiding people, namely those who may wish to socialise in the evening and late at night and those who wish to relax in the quiet enjoyment of their property, although obviously these two categories are not mutually exclusive. I could go further.</P>
    <P>In introducing this measure, I wish to echo the sentiments expressed recently by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, about the serious social and health consequences of a youth culture in which alcohol consumption plays a major role. A generation ago, younger people had far less money to spend on alcohol. Nowadays, cost does not seem to be a serious constraint on consumption. Significantly, the consumption of spirits in Ireland has grown by 50% in the past five years. The Minister for Health and Children is properly concerned with the health implications of a drink culture. As Minister with responsibility for criminal and licensing law, I have major concerns about the implications of the drink culture for public order and civil society. Wanton violence, thuggery and destructiveness are increasingly obvious symptoms of a decline in public order. These further affect victims and potential victims, they undermine our collective sense of security, decrease our sense of freedom from fear and degrade our amenity of life, particularly in urban areas. One of the most disturbing developments in recent years has been the mindless but vicious behaviour of young men who carry out random &ldquo;run-by&rdquo; assaults, consisting of a blow to the face of completely innocent and inoffensive strangers. Such offences are difficult to prosecute but I hope that any proven case will be regarded by all concerned with appropriate gravity. I am no latter day puritan or killjoy, either in outlook or in habit, but I am clear about the need for responsibility in this matter. Purveyors and consumers of alcohol are equally responsible under the law for the consequences of excessive consumption.</P>
    <P>In this context, I acknowledge that punishment and sentencing are the functions of the judicial arm of the State. While we would not expect the Judiciary to regard imprisonment as a first resort for offenders who cause disorder while drunk, it may be that a judicious combination of immediate substantial fines, coupled with a deferment of the issue of custodial sentences could be part of an effective strategy to curb public order offences, especially in the case of first offenders. There is no greater incentive towards good behaviour than having the issue of a possible custodial sentence deferred in order to assess the capacity of a convicted public order offender to adjust his or <Col N="630" /> her social behaviour to comply with decent norms.</P>
    <P>In the context of the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to achieve more uniformity in sentencing, I will be considering the possibility of providing a statutory basis for sentencing principles and guidelines. This Bill is designed to afford a greater degree of safety and protection to persons who may be out and about, most probably at night, for whatever reason, so that they will not be accosted by drunken or disorderly delinquents intent on creating trouble. We have seen how these drunken episodes can escalate into serious public order disturbances and late night street violence which can result in serious injury or death. Very simply put, the purpose of this Bill is to augment the law so as to tackle the problem of drink-related late night disturbances and the growing problem of late night street violence which has its origins in or around licensed premises and fast food outlets in urban areas. The Bill applies to pubs, off-licences, discos, night clubs, dance venues of all types, amusement arcades, chip shops, take-aways and mobile food vehicles. The Bill, we hope, will strengthen existing Garda powers in this area and will extend, in one important respect, the sanctions which may be imposed on offenders under the Public Order Act, 1994. I will return to that aspect of the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>The first of the two main provisions in the Bill takes as its starting point the fact that owners of premises which are licensed to dispense intoxicating liquor on its own or in conjunction with other entertainment or leisure activities are in an economically privileged position. That position is balanced with a duty to behave responsibly with respect to the supply of alcohol to their customers. In making those remarks, I would say the majority of licensees are responsible in the manner in which they carry out their legal and social duties. It goes without saying that they are already under an obligation under civil law to ensure that those customers are not harmed in any way under the general neighbour principle which applies in our law of torts. This Bill directly underscores the fact that they are also under a duty to ensure that their sale and supply of drink does not interfere with the rights of others and is not injurious to the common good.</P>
    <P>The owners of food premises of the type covered by the Bill are not, for the most part, directly involved in the sale of alcohol but, as most of us know, their premises can, unfortunately, act, from time to time, as a magnet or focal point for intoxicated or belligerent elements looking for trouble at the slightest provocation and sometimes even without such provocation. Unfortunately for the victims and other persons affected by the noise, nuisance or disorder, the end result is the same &ndash; a sense of mayhem on our streets. Proprietors of these establishments will now have to take a close look at the management and conduct of their premises and introduce whatever management policy changes are necessary in conjunction with the assistance of the local gardaí, if necessary, to ensure that unruly <Col N="631" /> elements do not frequent or congregate in the vicinity of their premises.</P>
    <P>This will be accomplished by providing gardaí with new powers so that they can apply in particular circumstances to the District Court for a closure order which will have the effect of limiting hours of opening of a premises which is the principal focus of or associated with serious trouble or disorder and involving persons who have been present on their premises. I stress at this point that this power only arises where the owner of the premises has failed to act on foot of prior warnings by the Garda Síochána about the problem and has ignored its advice to take whatever steps may be necessary to eliminate it. Under the order the premises may be restricted from opening for certain periods or it may be closed down altogether. There are already precedents in recent legislation for such action in relation to offences connected with the sale of drugs or the supply of drink to under age persons on premises licensed for the sale of drink. As I already said, the type of premises covered by this Bill is wider.</P>
    <P>The second key provision in this Bill applies to persons who may be charged with a public order related street offence under the Public Order Act, 1994. It means that a person who is facing conviction for such an offence may also suffer the additional penalty of an exclusion order prohibiting him or her from entering or being in the vicinity of specified premises outside which the incident giving rise to the original incident occurred for up to a period of 12 months. A breach of this order will itself be a serious offence punishable by a substantial fine or a term of imprisonment. If a person has to serve a term of imprisonment for the particular offence under the Public Order Act, 1994, the term of the exclusion order will apply immediately from the date of release.</P>
    <P>In essence, therefore, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill will ensure that our law is more responsive to the needs of society in fighting serious, threatening and disruptive anti-social behaviour and will reinforce the message that those who engage in such behaviour will be dealt with quickly and effectively through the criminal justice system. We owe it to the people we serve, as legislators, to take the steps we see necessary to ensure that they can walk the streets late at night and rest peacefully in their homes. The proposed measures, I hope, will result in significant reductions in crime, public disorder for local residents and the serious nuisance associated with late night disturbances. They will also provide improved protection, reassurance and safety for the majority of law abiding members of the public who fear that they may be caught up in the development of trouble making and general delinquency.</P>
    <P>As regards individuals who persist in getting drunk and involved in loutish behaviour, this is a matter for which they must take personal <Col N="632" /> responsibility. We will ensure that the streets are policed and that this Bill will give the Garda Síochána effective additional powers to deal with the perpetrators. We will see to it that the message goes out that this type of behaviour is not acceptable. For their part, the purveyors of alcohol, whether it is associated with other forms of entertainment through clubs, concerts or whatever, will now have to take their responsibilities to their customers and the wider population much more seriously than heretofore or else suffer the consequences. The owners of food premises particularly those labelled as fast food outlets, although that term covers a range of suppliers from the cheap and cheerful to the more respectable family run and franchised premises, have, in general, nothing to fear from this Bill but they will have to take adequate measures &ndash; I understand that this, in many cases, is already occurring &ndash; to ensure that their premises do not become the focal point of public disorder and abusive or dangerous behaviour.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the operational response of the Garda Síochána to the problem the Bill addresses. The latest initiative, Operation Encounter, was developed out of the success of the previous Operation Oíche which had provided the gardaí with considerable logistical information on the times and locations of serious incidents of drunken public disorder. The gardaí are now in a position to target this problem at source. Certain venues such as night clubs, licensed premises and fast food outlets which have been associated with rowdyism and more serious manifestations of loutish thuggery now receive special attention at times which public order problems are likely to be prevalent. Particular attention is also being paid to ensuring that owners and managers of such premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care which they owe to their patrons and other members of the public in relation to these matters. The changes in the law which this Bill proposes will give the gardaí significant additional leverage in this whole matter and should assist them greatly in restoring peace and order to areas which have been plagued by the problem of drunken hooliganism.</P>
    <P>I will deal now in some detail with the sections of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision which sets out the Short Title and provides for the collective citations of the Bill and other Acts whose provisions are affected by it. The Bill will come into operation one month after the day of its passing. Section 2, the interpretation section, contains standard provisions for the necessary interpretation and defines certain terms used in the Bill. The provisions of the Bill apply to what are termed &ldquo;catering premises&rdquo; which are defined as any premises licensed under the Licensing Acts, 1883 to 2000, the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1908 to 2000, the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1986, and to any food outlet used for the sale of food, including take-aways, whether fixed or mobile. Thus the <Col N="633" /> Bill will apply to pubs, off-licences, dance venues of all types, amusement arcades, chip shops, take-aways and mobile food vans. The term &ldquo;licensed premises&rdquo; and &ldquo;licensee&rdquo; have particular meanings for the purposes of the Bill and they are somewhat wider in scope than those terms are generally understood to mean in the context of the liquor licensing code.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with exclusion orders. It enables the District Court to make an exclusion order as an additional penalty where a person is convicted of certain public order offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order ) Act, 1994. These relevant offences are intoxication in a public place &ndash; section 4; disorderly conduct in a public place &ndash; section 5; threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour &ndash; section 6; distribution or display of offensive material &ndash; section 7; failure to comply with a garda &ndash; section 8; and wilful obstruction &ndash; section 9.</P>
    <P>An exclusion order prohibits a person from entering or being in the vicinity of a specified premises for a period of up to 12 months. If a term of imprisonment has been imposed for the offence for which he or she is convicted, the exclusion order will take effect immediately after the person is released from prison. The governor or person in charge of a place of detention will be obliged to notify the Garda Commissioner when such a person is to be released so that the exclusion order can be applied from that date.</P>
    <P>A breach of an exclusion order will be an offence. An exclusion order may only be imposed for offences which are committed after the commencement of the Act. The new sanction cannot be imposed retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with applications for closure orders. Under this section a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector may apply to the District Court for a closure order to restrict the opening hours of a premises covered by the Bill. Before an application for a closure order can be made, there must either have been disorder on the premises or excessive noise emanating from the premises or its vicinity and such disorder or noise must be likely to recur.</P>
    <P>The disorder or noise must involve persons who were on the premises. The noise criterion has been drafted to ensure that it exceeds what would normally be regarded as acceptable or reasonable in the circumstances. The term &ldquo;in the vicinity&rdquo; is defined as not exceeding a distance of 100 metres from the premises involved. In addition, before making an application for a closure order, the Garda Síochána must have notified the licensee of the premises that disorder or excessive noise has occurred and requested that he or she take such action within his or her control to prevent a recurrence. A maximum of seven days is allowed for the licensee to rectify the problem. The owner or the operator of the premises shall be given notice of the intention to apply for a closure order.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with closure orders and sets out the grounds on which such orders can be made, <Col N="634" /> their application and related provisions. The court must be satisfied that disorder or noise has occurred and that the making of the closure order is necessary to prevent a recurrence. A closure order could require a premises to close earlier than would otherwise be permitted on a particular day or days, or for a certain period, or else require the premises to be closed completely for a period not exceeding seven days. In the case of a subsequent order having to be made, the premises could be closed for a period not exceeding 30 days.</P>
    <P>When making the order, the court may specify that prior to the annual renewal of the licence or registration applicable to the particular premises, certain requirements would have to be fulfilled, for example, the installation of a CCTV system, restrictions on the type of substances to be sold or limits to be placed on the number of persons who may be admitted.</P>
    <P>In considering whether to make a closure order, the court can take into account the conduct of the licensee, manager or employees in relation to the operation of the premises. A closure order may apply to the whole or part of the premises and shall specify the ground or grounds upon which it was made. It will come into effect when written notice of it has been served on the licensee or manager of the premises.</P>
    <P>A notice specifying the closure times and the grounds for the closure must be affixed to the premises in a prominent position. It shall be an offence not to display such a notice, with a fine for a first offence of &euro;300 and up to &euro;600 for a second or subsequent offence. Employees of premises which are closed will not be disadvantaged in their employment during the period of closure.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with appeals and provides that the right of appeal lies to the Circuit Court against the making of a closure order. To ensure the overall effectiveness of a closure order, the lodgement of an appeal will not of itself affect the coming into operation of the order unless the Circuit Court decides accordingly within seven days after the date the closure order was made. This will then suspend the order pending the hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the extension of closure orders and permits the court to extend the order with such variation as it sees fit. Section 8 deals with the breach of closure orders and provides that a person who permits his or her premises to be open in breach of a closure order will incur a fine of &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. It shall be an offence for a person to be found on a catering premises in breach of a closure order unless he or she can show that the requisite notice was not affixed to the exterior of the premises. It will also be an offence to fail to leave a catering premises when requested to do so by a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with liability for offences by bodies corporate and unincorporated and is a <Col N="635" /> standard technical provision. Section 10 deals with jurisdiction and provides for the jurisdiction of the District Court and the Circuit Court in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I look forward with interest to the contributions by Deputies from all sides of the House on the provisions in the Bill. Many will have their own views and will doubtless be in a position to make a valuable input to the debate. Given that this is a new measure and that it can have serious effects, both for those affected by it and for proprietors of premises, I look forward to Committee Stage and will deal positively with suggestions to improve the effectiveness of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, Sir, on your new position as Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I also congratulate the Minister on his appointment and the new Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.</P>
      <P>My initial reaction to the Bill was to ask where was the substance. The Minister cannot be serious in suggesting that it will solve the problem of street violence. Under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in government, we have become a nation of crime victims. People are afraid to walk the streets at night and the situation is deteriorating.</P>
      <P>The former Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, likes to claim that in the Government's last term of office, he introduced more Bills in this area than anyone else. However, it did not achieve anything. What is required is more rigorous enforcement of the existing laws. Two years ago the then Minister said there was no appreciable increase in public order offences and street violence. We now know the nonsense of that.</P>
      <P>The Bill ignores the root cause of public disorder, which is alcohol abuse. It is mentioned in the front page of the explanatory memorandum but it is not addressed thereafter. The Bill is out of touch with the needs of the country. Given what is happening, it almost amounts to Mickey Mouse legislation. All the solicitors I have spoken to have said it is almost worthless. The Department should start to talk and listen to the solicitors and gardaí who are dealing with this problem on the streets because the provisions of the legislation are not relevant to their concerns.</P>
      <P>The Minister inherited this legislation. Had he been in office at the time I am sure he would not have sanctioned it. I therefore look forward to having the Bill amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that a District Court may place an exclusion order on an individual who commits an offence in or near a premises. This almost amounts to an admission that the criminal justice system is ineffectual in reforming those who are convicted of crimes. It is almost as if they are expected to commit the same crimes upon release from prison. There is no talk of reforming them, but we would save ourselves a lot of time and grief if we tried to reform them while they are incarcerated rather than expecting them to continually repeat the same crimes. We are <Col N="636" /> assuming that this cycle of violence will go on and on. This part of the Bill will have very little effect on street violence and frankly it is a waste of police time.</P>
    <P>The second part, which provides that the Garda can apply to the District Court to shut down an offending premises, is fine but one wonders if this will be implemented and enforced like many pieces of legislation which were enacted by the previous Government. It also involves more paperwork for gardaí. Introducing legislation is laudable, but the Minister need only take a look at what happened regarding the underage drinking legislation which was introduced by the previous Government about two years ago. Up until recently, I do not think there has been one pub shut down in Dublin or Cork city because of that legislation. Less than half of the 184 prosecutions have gone through successfully. County Mayo, with 23, tops the list for successful prosecutions. One wonders why that is so. The reason is fairly simple, that the chief superintendents there are enforcing the law. Many superintendents and chief superintendents around the country are simply not doing so and are not getting any direction or leadership from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do exactly that.</P>
    <P>When the former Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was introducing this Bill he said that these measures would be tough and added that some people might find them unpalatable. I find them downright weak and, to a certain extent, inane. If this is the answer to street violence, then this nation is in a great deal of trouble.</P>
    <P>Many members of the public feel that this Chamber is completely irrelevant to their lives and that politicians do not have a clue. When you look at this, you really must agree with them. One person made a good comment. He summed it up by saying that what we are dealing with here is an epidemic of thuggery. There are more drunks on the streets and as a result there is considerably more violence. It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The first page of the explanatory memorandum states that the Bill's purpose is &ldquo;to strengthen the law in order to deal more effectively with late night public disorder and disturbance which mainly has its origins in alcohol abuse&rdquo;, and then proceeds to completely ignore alcohol abuse. It does not suggest how the Minister would reform that situation. It does not deal with it. The whole premise of the Bill seems to be a total avoidance of alcohol-related disturbances. The Minister should go and ask the general practitioners, those guys who stay up until 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the morning dressing wounds on weekends. He should ask them what is the cause of street violence. To a person, they will tell him that it is due to the abuse of alcohol.</P>
    <P>Much of what has happened in the past couple of years can be put down to the liberalisation of our drinking laws, for which the former Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was responsible. Two years later many people are dead and others are on life support machines, and this is what the Govern<Col N="637" /> ment comes up with. We need to get real and people in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform need to start visiting the real Ireland. They need to start talking to the gardaí on the beat, they need to start talking to the night-club owners and they need to start talking to the teenagers who are binge-drinking.</P>
    <P>The reality is that young fellows will go out and have four or five pints and they will get a bit bloated. Therefore they will go for the re-energisers, the likes of Goldschlager or Jaegermister, After Shock or Sidekicks, and they will knock back about five or six of them. Then they will go into a disco or a night-club and pop an &ldquo;E&rdquo;, and that will keep them going for about four or five hours. That is when little Johnny, in whose mouth butter would not usually melt, becomes a monster and that is when he becomes violent. It is happening to thousands of young men around the country. That is the culture that has arisen because of the liberalisation of the licensing laws. The Minister must stem the availability of alcohol to minors and the type of drinks that are available to them.</P>
    <P>In flesh and blood terms, there are about 30 victims of street violence every day. Irish teenagers top the European league for binge-drinking. Some 50% of A&amp;E admissions are alcohol-related. There has been a 50% increase in alcohol addiction among those under the age of 25 in the past ten years. That contains a fairly simple message; it is not rocket science. There is a direct correlation. Many of these people drink alcohol as well as taking ecstasy and cocaine. They mix both and what happens is one gets a young man whose heart pumps at ten times its normal rate. It takes about four or five gardaí to bring that person under control in many cases. As a result, one ends up with injured gardaí as well as injured young people. A special Garda committee has been set up to look at the possibility of giving the gardaí non-lethal weapons like stun guns. We must support the gardaí and we must look seriously at giving them the tools to address these problems.</P>
    <P>What else should the Minister do? He should allow gardaí to detain people overnight. That would provide a sharp lesson for some people. There has been an increase in street violence since the traditional method of holding people in cells overnight before bringing them into court was dispensed with.</P>
    <P>It is also useless making an affluent middle-class person put money into a poor box. This has no deterrent effect. It would be more effective if the Minister published the person's name in the newspaper. He should publish an official list of offences and put it in the local newspaper. If he must, the Minister should shame the offender. Perhaps we should start thinking about making the parents of juveniles responsible for damage caused and allow people to sue the parents of little Johnny who causes the damage &ndash; that will make him think. The Minister spoke of personal responsibility and that is what it is all about. <Col N="638" /> There is no sense of personal responsibility when it comes to this matter.</P>
    <P>Where is the provision of CCTV? I attended a meeting of Dungarvan Urban District Council last Monday night. I have been begging people, including the county manager, and business people for money so we can provide CCTV. The prospectus was presented to us on Monday night. Unfortunately, we were told that we cannot apply because no application forms are available. This must be sorted out. People around the country are looking for the provision of CCTV and there does not seem to be any willingness in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to speed up this process.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister increase the number of undercover officers in night-clubs and pubs? Will he properly enforce the statutory closure times for pubs? Closing time in this country is almost a matter of opinion. One can give leeway of five or ten minutes, but some people are flouting the law and are getting away with it in certain areas.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister introduce a proper national ID card system? This is favoured by senior gardaí and they have gone on record about that. Will he regulate the bouncers who, in my opinion, cause many of the problems inside and outside the night-clubs and pubs?</P>
    <P>Are we going to see a hands-on Minister? Perhaps that is the most important question. Are we going to see another Minister who just throws legislation at a problem? What we need is someone who deals with this issue head-on. We have had Operation Oíche and Operation Encounter. In the first 22 days of Operation Encounter, 5,300 offences were committed. Other similarly disastrous operations come to mind like Operation Barbarossa and Operation Market Garden. The operations concerned were totally ineffective.</P>
    <P>The Government has been in denial about this issue for a long time. The Bill will not deal with street violence as we know it. The primary response should be one of providing preventative policing. By that I mean putting more gardaí on the beat and providing increased support for them. At best, the Bill is a continuation of a PR exercise designed by a Government before a general election. Things were becoming quite bad on the crime front so this legislation was introduced. At worst, the Bill is misguided because it misses the point entirely with regard to alcohol abuse. On too many occasions legislation has been thrown at the problem of crime. This Bill is another example of that and it will not solve anything. What we need is implementation and enforcement and the resolve and leadership necessary to ensure the former come to pass.</P>
    <P>What we seem to have here is a complete absence of a reflective policy on policing. We need to review the kind of policing we operate and not just throw Bills of this nature at it. The Minister must do better than this. The country does not need more legal smart talk, it needs a Minister who walks the walk. It is my opinion that, as a Minister, Deputy McDowell will be <Col N="639" /> judged to a large extent on whether the situation on the streets improves, on whether morale among gardaí improves and on whether organisation within the Garda Síochána as a whole improves.</P>
    <P>I look forward to working with him in Committee on the Bill, which is worthless. I reiterate that I know the Minister inherited the Bill, which should be amended because it is loosely written and will prove, more than anything else, to be a drain on Garda resources. I hope he will take the points I have made on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Justice, Equality and Law Reform portfolio. I also congratulate Deputy Deasy on a spirited and inspiring maiden speech which contained a number of refreshing comments. I feel like a veteran at this stage, despite the fact that I was one of the newest Members of the House during the lifetime of the previous Dáil. I also wish to congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment.</P>
      <P>I concur with many of the comments Deputy Deasy made about the legislation. The Bill contains nothing the Labour Party would wish to oppose, but it also contains very little. Deputy Deasy described it as a &ldquo;Mickey Mouse&rdquo; Bill, but I would describe it as a Fianna Fáil focus group fig leaf. I am not sure about the Minister's party, but the Fianna Fáil party began to panic in the lead-up to the election when focus groups began to report that crime was a major issue. This was despite the fact that Mr. Zero Tolerance had occupied the position the Minister now holds for the past five years and had made his reputation on the fact that he was going to sweep into the Department and initiate change. When in Opposition, the former Minister attacked everything his predecessor did or did not do. He then entered office, stated that he was going to clean everything up and then failed miserably to do so. That information was fed back to the Government by the focus groups in recent months and a sudden urgency was given to addressing the fact that there is a serious public order problem in this country. As a result, this legislation was drawn up and many public statements were made. However, nothing has been done to address this most serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the job done by Deputy O'Donoghue and the two parties in Government during the past five years, it must be stated that things are worse now than they were in 1997. If the Minister asks anyone outside the House whether things have improved during the intervening period, they will answer in the negative and state that they live in greater fear. People are afraid to walk the streets or to allow their children to go out, they are afraid of being at home alone in case they are attacked or their houses broken into, they fear walking through certain parts of their own neighbourhoods in case they are attacked, they fear being knocked down by stolen cars and <Col N="640" /> they are afraid of being intimidated if they report crime to the Garda and, as a result, a great deal of crime goes unreported. While the Minister's predecessor was able to inform the House that the incidence of certain forms of crime was in decline, his comments were simply not true because such incidents were not being reported.</P>
    <P>The situation is out of control. As the parent of a young man &ndash; I accept that there are many Members who are younger than me and who have probably experienced this for themselves &ndash; I am aware that there is a real fear with regard to allowing young people to go out at night in our cities. That is the problem we face. In many instances, communities are turning to the local heavies rather than the Garda and getting them to deal with the perpetrators of violence in certain situations. That is a matter of great concern and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I accept that this legislation does not address the entire area of public order and is specific to disorder occurring outside certain premises. If the Minister is intent on doing a good job, he will be obliged to address this matter in a much broader and more holistic way than that pursued in the Bill. This legislation merely scratches at the surface of the issue and I agree with Deputy Deasy that it will not make any difference.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, contain provisions relating to underage persons. These sections provide for temporary closure orders and they remove the reasonable grounds defence with regard to the serving of people who are underage. However, everyone knows that people under 18 are still being served in pubs and off licences and nobody seems to be doing anything about it. A consideration of the way that legislation was implemented would surely lead us to have doubts about the implementation of the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, in many ways, an attempt to close the stable door after the horse has bolted. In other words, it tries to deal with the consumption of too much alcohol rather than trying to prevent such consumption. The latter is the real problem. Figures released recently show an alarming increase in the rate of drinking among young people. That is another issue which must be addressed in a far more serious way than simply dealing with what they do when they end up on the streets having indulged in the various forms of alcoholic drinks, etc., to which Deputy Deasy referred.</P>
    <P>There is clearly an obligation, under the intoxicating liquor legislation, on licensees to refuse to serve drink to people who have had enough. I would have preferred to see the Minister introduce legislation that contained tough provisions in that regard. It is clear that publicans are serving people who are in no fit state to drink any more alcohol. Placing the onus on licence holders would have been a more effective way of dealing with this issue and of obliging them to refuse to serve people who are under 18.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" />The Bill is a desperate attempt to deal with the symptoms of a social problem rather than dealing with that problem itself. We must address the fact that young people are growing up in a culture where there is little else for them to do except go to places where drink is served. They do not have places in which they can gather where alcohol is not available. I met four teenage girls three days ago when I was visiting a particular part of my constituency and they informed me that they literally have nowhere to go and nothing to do because they are now on their school holidays. They said that they are hanging around on street corners and being told that they are causing trouble. The Government would do well to address that issue. Perhaps before we ensure that we have wonderful national facilities for sport, etc., we could ensure that we have wonderful local community facilities for sport and other activities for young people in particular.</P>
    <P>Structural reform of the Garda and the strengthening of Garda numbers must be part of the answer. I recently received a letter from a group of business people in my city. The letter, which was also sent to the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to Ministers of State in my constituency, claimed that Garda numbers in Limerick are more than 50 below Government policy. I am sure there is a similar shortfall in other urban areas. There is a gross shortage of gardaí on the streets protecting the peace, in keeping with the title of the force, Garda Síochána. This shortage must be addressed. There is a perception in many communities that there is not a Garda presence when it is needed most, especially at night time. Vulnerable elderly people and young mothers living alone feel particularly bereft.</P>
    <P>My party has made proposals for the structural reform of the Garda. These include a proposal to establish a police authority similar to the one in Northern Ireland as recommended in the Patten report, the appointment of a Garda ombudsman and the setting up of local Garda liaison committees. These committees would provide for interaction between local community leaders and the Garda authorities to identify the specific needs of local areas. We must address the problem of Garda numbers and give gardaí the capacity to do their job. How can the Garda implement this and other legislation with the numbers they have been allowed? CCTV is awaited in many places, including my city, but it has not been installed. I would not support Deputy Deasy's proposals regarding stun guns but I agree with him that we must give the gardaí the back-up they need.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; has been bandied about but it has not been implemented nor has it been understood. A section of the National Crime Forum report of 1998 is devoted to zero tolerance. The report lists the essential features of this paradigm of crime control. It states:</P>
    <P>The connection between disorder, fear and serious crime must be noted and addressed. <Col N="642" /> The seriousness of crime is to be defined by the context, neighbourhood priorities and the extent to which problems destabilise neighbourhoods and communities. The priorities in crime control should be to prevent and control crime, to restore and maintain order and reduce citizen fear and not merely to apprehend and process offenders.</P>
    <P>The report later states:</P>
    <P>A wider view of law enforcement is taken where emphasis is placed on defining and solving the larger problems within which individual cases occur in contrast to an approach which tends to be less preventive and which responds only when crime occurs. This means a reactive approach to individual cases.</P>
    <P>This report is worth reading. We must tackle the causes of crime. We must address the prevention of crime rather than merely responding when crimes have been committed. This Bill is concerned only with responding to crimes when they have been committed. Zero tolerance needs to be rehabilitated by the current Administration. I hope the Minister will look at this issue. We must address the problem of crime in a holistic way rather than introducing legislation which we do not have the manpower to enforce and which merely scratches the surface of the problems.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems facing our society is out-of-control binge drinking which results in random acts of violence, thuggery, street disorder and the imposition of fear on innocent citizens. The Bill is concerned solely with disorder which occurs within 100 metres of certain types of premises. People who drink to excess often commit crimes far from the premises where they may have been drinking. I would like to see the terms of the legislation extended to deal with this situation. The Bill does not deal with disorder in places other than outside pubs or fast-food outlets. Much of this type of disorder takes place on green areas in housing estates, on street corners or down alley-ways. The problem affects a broader range of areas than is dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the attempt to control the behaviour of bouncers. In a recent case CCTV evidence made it clear that the position of bouncers is sometimes abused. The regulation of bouncers was promised by the previous Government but it has not been done yet.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that innocent young people are not charged with public order offences. Some young people cause trouble at the end of a night's drinking but others do not. We should not assume that young people who are in the company of trouble makers are trouble makers themselves. In the frenzy of a disorderly situation those who are not responsible for violence can be dragged into it. We must ensure that innocent young people are protected. Young people who do not drink might easily find themselves in the company of others who cause disturbance. Young people have a great sense of justice and we must ensure <Col N="643" /> that those who have not caused trouble do not suffer under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not object to this Bill and I hope it can be strengthened on Committee Stage. However, the huge problem of violence on our streets and the explosion of excessive drinking in recent years must be tackled in a number of ways. We must consider prevention, provide alternative places for young people to go and ensure that owners of licensed premises fulfil their obligation not to serve alcohol to people who have already had enough to drink.</P>
    <P>The Minister is an energetic person. He has strong views and I am sure I will disagree with him on many issues. However, I hope he will consider the points made by the Opposition and endeavour to address this issue in a broader way. The two Government parties ran a very successful election campaign but that will not be enough to deal with this issue. People want to see real results and to get rid of the fear they have suffered for the past five years. They want effective action from the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I preface my remarks by congratulating you, a Cheann Comhairle, on your election. We have known each other for a long time. When you were Minister for Health, you were kind enough to appoint me to the Tallaght Hospital board, which started me on the road to where I now find myself. Many people ask me if I am sorry not to have been here 20 years ago. I am not sorry about that but I am very happy to have been elected on this occasion and I look forward to my time here. I warmly congratulate you and thank you for the welcome you have given me and other new Members.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate the new Minister and wish him well in his duties. I believe he will be a fine Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I look forward to working with him. He knows I will be wearing a path to his door on behalf of the people of Dublin South-West from areas such as Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills and Tallaght. I also convey my good wishes to the new Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. There is a certain irony in the fact that I am speaking after my good friend, Deputy O'Sullivan, because people often make the comparison between Tallaght and Limerick, sometimes in unfortunate ways. However, we should be positive about our towns and cities. For a long time, we said that Tallaght had the population of a city but the status of a village, but thank God that has changed. Tallaght is a great place and I am delighted to represent the good people of my constituency here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to take the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is important for my constituency. Standing here, I am conscious I am following in the steps of Sean Walsh and Chris Flood, who was a well-respected Deputy since 1987. If Chris Flood had not taken the decision to stand <Col N="644" /> down, I would still be toiling away for him and other candidates, including Deputy Conor Lenihan, in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Every week at my seven local advice clinics, I listen to the stressed parents and on occasion grandparents of young men who, while socialising over a weekend, have been the victims of unprovoked attacks. The shock and stress this causes within their families and their parents' feelings of helplessness often results in blame being directed towards us as politicians and the Garda for not doing enough.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002, starts the process of delivering on the Government's commitments, as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government, published by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, to tackle the issues around public order and street crime, particularly in the level of damage being done in the hours immediately after the pubs and clubs close and young people are on their way home.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and his predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue, and their officials for producing a Bill that goes much of the way towards giving a lead in how public order offences will be dealt with proactively by both the Garda Síochána and the courts.</P>
    <P>To implement this Bill on the streets of our cities, towns and even villages, it will be necessary to bring about a major change in how the public views &ldquo;public disorder&rdquo;. In the same way as public reaction has progressed over the past ten years from general sympathy for a drink driving offender who is caught to the case today where there is no sympathy for drink driving offenders we will need to spearhead a public information programme to seek the public's support in stamping out this menace that affects both my constituency of Dublin South-West and the entire country. All the Irish soccer stars are heroes and Robbie Keane is one of the heroes of my constituency who gives a fine example as highlighted by the media this morning. Someone like Robbie Keane should be recruited to spearhead such a campaign and continue to score more goals for the country.</P>
    <P>This programme should be a partnership between the Department, the Garda, and the business sectors that operate in the supply of entertainment and recreation services, namely off-licences, pubs, clubs, restaurants and fast-food outlets. I listened to what was said about fast-food outlets earlier. I was regaled by the Minister's accurate description and we need to understand that.</P>
    <P>The message should be that public order offences will no longer be shrugged off and will be treated seriously and that young people, particularly those in their late teens and early twenties, need to take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences of their actions. To this extent the ability for a judge to exclude a convicted offender from a specified licensed premises, as defined in the Bill, to include pubs, off-licences, clubs, amusement <Col N="645" /> arcades and food establishments is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, in the future, consider such exclusion orders to be the practice rather than an option, where alcohol is presented in evidence or as a defence in all criminal cases. Where the convicted offender is found to be in breach of the order a subsequent community service order or similar deterrent for the same period should be applied.</P>
    <P>This House has an unenviable record in passing legislation into law that the people believe to be unsuccessful due to our inability to implement or sustain the enforcement of that law. The success of this Bill will depend on the resources that are given to the Garda Síochána to apply it. The agreed public consensus is that gardaí on the streets, supported by mobile units at going home time, are an essential part of the policing approach necessary to reclaim our right to get home without difficulties.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, there is dedicated work and support of gardaí from Rathfarnham, Crumlin and Tallaght stations who cover the vast areas of Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills and Tallaght, but who cannot be everywhere. Many of my colleagues in this House would confirm similar difficulties all over the country. I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan in that if we do not support the Garda Síochána and uphold its right to do the job on our behalf, we are creating different systems. Whether that is in Limerick, Kerry North, Tallaght or elsewhere, that is wrong. We should not be afraid to state that and I am sorry certain parties are not here to let us hear their views on that because that is the way it should be. The right of the Garda Síochána to look after our rights should be upheld and every party in the State, certainly those represented in the Dáil, should subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country. Policing structures within the major population areas need to be revisited and addressed as a matter of urgency by the new Minister and his officials. All Deputies will ask the Minister to visit their constituencies, but I look forward to him coming to Dublin South-West, particularly Tallaght. We will not only talk to him about this Bill but will also show him the cramped conditions in our one Garda station and the need for a new Garda station in the west Tallaght estates. Although I am not competing with Limerick or anywhere else, I will be able to show him where more manpower and good use of Garda resources can help in fighting crime in our cities.</P>
    <P>Returning to my earlier comment about personal responsibility, I want the Minister to say that further consideration should be given to setting up night courts and to the system of appointing and training peace commissioners who would, following the arrest of public order offenders and subject to civil liberty requirements, have the offender held in the Garda station overnight and taken to court the next day. If convicted, a fine <Col N="646" /> and ban should be imposed and an offender who continues to appear before the court on similar charges should be given a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>The prospect that a young man &ndash; regrettably it is mostly young men &ndash; would have to spend the night in the Garda station, sober up, appear in court, need to ask the support of his family and, if convicted, be fined and suffer the embarrassment of being unable to go to his normal pub or club, will begin that change in public attitude necessary to reduce the menace of public disorder.</P>
    <P>The fact that many cases involving a public order offence take up to nine months to come before the courts is not acceptable to the victims and is unfair on the community which has suffered the nuisance or damage, or in many cases both. The gravity of the offence by the offender has diminished by that time and is seen as a nuisance to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second section of the Bill on closure orders, I commend the Minister and his officials on the broadening of the types of business covered. The pub trade is laden with legislation but we should not forget that pubs and clubs are not the only sources of alcohol. The responsibility of off-licences and supermarkets in selling alcohol also needs to be reflected.</P>
    <P>I will have to learn, over the next five years, not to be parochial but, for the moment, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will forgive me. People are in uproar in Tallaght because, apparently, a supermarket can open an off-licence practically overnight, with no advertising and no recourse to the planning laws. In Springfield, where I live, that has greatly upset the local community, but I do not ask the Minister to legislate for Springfield estate just because Charlie O'Connor lives there. However, it is an important issue and the Minister will find many communities around the country saying the same thing. The Bill's extension of responsibility to restaurants and late night fast food outlets and other sectors is greatly overdue and will, I believe, be effective. I also support that part of the Bill that gives business owners the opportunity to remedy the problem before this &ldquo;closure order&rdquo; measure is needed.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the gardaí the ability to deal with a local problem and allows for a joint approach with the business owner to take place before a court appearance becomes necessary. I am sure all business owners will support and welcome this initiative. In my constituency, with a population larger than any of the provincial cities, we have a need for initiatives from the Minister's Department that will allow the residents of that area to rest easy at night, whether they or their children are out socialising. At the risk of repeating myself, I believe this need can best be met by a fully resourced and supported Garda force on the ground, an additional Garda station for the Tallaght area and proactive and practical legislation such as this Bill, together with the commitments outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government. I commend this Bill to the House <Col N="647" /> and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak on it. I wish the Minister well and I look forward to engaging in further discussion as the Bill progresses through the House. Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and wish him well, but I have to say he has started off badly. I had expected a change from the former Minister for zero tolerance, following whose term of office there is more crime on the streets than ever and people are afraid to walk the streets of this country. I was genuinely pleased when the present Minister was appointed because I believed he was the man to take on the criminal elements. I am disappointed he allowed this Bill to come before the House without major changes being made. However, we must deal with the Bill as it stands. In wishing the Minister well, I know he now occupies the position for which he always longed. Like many of us, he started in the back benches and there were some disappointments along the way. However, there was a back door and he got to the Office of Attorney General. Now that he has got to where he wants to be, I hope he will do the job well.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill, we have now reached a situation in this country where drink is generally acceptable. Everybody, including judges, seems to have great sympathy for those who come before the courts, whether as alcoholics or drunks. That is acceptable in society and we have to change that. The last Government made a great mistake in increasing the opening hours under the licensing laws. My one regret is that we in the Opposition did not have the courage to oppose that at the time. In my view, that change has created additional problems. It has caused more violence on the streets and has resulted in people being on the streets much later at night. People living in urban areas have suffered greatly as a result of the new licensing laws. Some of the late night disturbance is completely outrageous and it should never have been allowed to happen. When an individual is brought to court, having beaten up his wife and children, wrecked the house and spent all the family's money, the plea is frequently made that he has a drink problem for which we are supposed to have sympathy. Such people should be dealt with through the medical system and sent into hospital if necessary. If they continue to offend and are not prepared to reform, they must be dealt with. It is time we stopped the softly, softly approach to the problems associated with drink. There is more sympathy for those with a drink problem than those suffering from cancer. We have to realise the extent of the problems being caused by excessive drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised the issue of late night takeaways on a previous occasion, I got considerable media coverage and a great deal of criticism from the takeaway owners. It is commonplace to see some <Col N="648" /> three or four hundred people coming out of a disco at two or three o'clock in the morning and heading to a chip shop, where they remain for another hour or two. I have seen that happening in my home town, in Castlebar and in the cities. It is quite outrageous. As well as being tanked up with drink, the new trend, to which Deputy Deasy referred earlier, is that people are also popping tablets. With the combination of Red Bull and tablets, they end up acting like bulls.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the Garda Síochána whose job, like that of teachers, is becoming more and more difficult and the people they have to deal with are becoming increasingly violent. The legal practitioners &ndash; the Minister's profession &ndash; go into court and do everything possible to embarrass the gardaí with a view to getting the thugs off. Gardaí are not professionally trained like the Minister's colleagues in the legal profession. In the presence of barristers and solicitors, people get away with telling the most blatant lies in court, while the unfortunate gardaí who do not have that legal training are put under pressure in presenting their case and defending their position. Perhaps the more senior members of the Garda have such training but the training of the ordinary members of the force is to protect the general public. They are not given the necessary resources. It is no longer good enough to send them out with their hands in their pockets. They should have batons and have the discretion to use them when necessary to put manners on unruly elements.</P>
    <P>There is now greater sympathy for the criminal than for the citizen who is affected by crime. Offenders get free legal aid at State expense, are defended in court by the best barristers and solicitors and then get the best treatment when they go to jail. It is time we looked after those who pay their taxes, who want to live peacefully in their homes and walk our streets in safety but cannot do so because they are unprotected. Fine Gael always prided itself on being a law and order party and I am delighted we are coming back to that position. As our new spokesman has shown today, law and order will be our number one priority and that is what will get us back into Government. From what I have heard from the Minister today, I see nothing to tackle the many problems which are out there. It is time the Garda Síochána was given the resources and the necessary powers. I hope the Minister will do one other thing&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour dealing with the criminals. I will give the Minister an example of my own experience. On the morning of St. Stephen's Day, I found that a thug had jumped on my car during the night and kicked in the windscreen, following which he did the same to my next door neighbour's car. Six months earlier, another thug had knocked off the wing mirror of my car, which cost <Col N="649" /> me £165 in old money. The gardaí caught the offender but, to this day, he has not been prosecuted and I have not been compensated for the damage to my car. Yet, there is wonderful sympathy for that type of individual. On another occasion, after I had left my house at 7 p.m. and returned at 11 p.m., I found that thugs &ndash; that is what I call them &ndash; had robbed my house. They went into the house, ransacked it and stole everything in it. When they went to court, they had free legal aid and a solicitor. When the solicitor got up in the court, I thought that the man on trial was about to be canonised as a saint, like the man canonised in Rome last week. I thought that the poor man was going to the priesthood or somewhere like that, and could not believe that this was the same thug who robbed, damaged and destroyed my house. Yet he walked away from the court. I saw him with his solicitor, who was paid for by the taxpayer and myself, and heard him described as a wonderful person.</P>
      <P>My wife is now afraid at night in her house, as are others because their houses were broken into. Something similar happened to my next-door neighbour and there is no help or support for these people. Yet when the case I mentioned came to court, there was wonderful back-up, free legal aid, the best solicitors and when those involved went to jail, they were well looked after. What are we going to do for the people affected by crime, as these people are? Nothing is being done for them.</P>
      <P>I want to return to CCTV cameras. It was announced in my local paper and the national press so many times that I thought there was to be a camera in every town and village. However, questions were put down in the House last year and we found that there was very little State money drawn down by local authorities because the Government had not got its act together. It is time CCTV cameras were put in place and time that criminals were identified and dealt with.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us that he has no control over the Judiciary. Well, he was very friendly with the Judiciary over the years and I hope that he can still speak to them, although he may not legally be able to do so. The time has come for the Judiciary to live in the real world. A judge last week said that he thought a defendant was his brother because he had appeared so many times before the judge. If the judge had dealt with the man six months before, he would not have re-appeared in court. That man would not come into court regularly if the judge was doing his job properly. He would be behind bars. I do not believe that every criminal should be behind bars but if people continue to break the law and come before the courts, Mountjoy Prison is the place for them. If they do not like Mountjoy Prison, they can be sent to Castlerea Prison and, if they do not like that, they can be sent to Loughan House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the places for such people and judges would not then have such problems. Criminals like this would not appear in court if they got two <Col N="650" /> years hard labour. It is time that we looked at the issue of hard labour. The Minister's colleague has taken away FÁS schemes. Instead of having those schemes, people who commit crimes should be put in yellow uniforms and made to clean up the streets. The general public will then be able to identify them and say: &ldquo;That is Joe Soap who robbed Mrs. O'Malley down the road&rdquo;. If the public were to point the finger at these people every day, they would think twice about committing crime. The softly-softly approach has to stop as does the sympathy regarding those who drink.</P>
    <P>We must protect the good citizens of this country. It is awful that there are old people going to bed at 7 p.m., praying that they will get through the night and will not be attacked in their homes, and that they will be able to get up in the morning alive and well. It is sad for this society that we have allowed this situation to develop and that we allow thugs to take over our streets, as they are doing. If the Minister wants to come with me, I will be delighted to walk the streets of Dublin with him or bring him to any street next Saturday night. I will take the Minister through the streets of Castlebar or Westport at 2 a.m. and will give him &euro;50 if he walks up and down the main street of the town by himself. The Minister will not do it because he will be afraid for his life when he sees people with drinks in their hands walking up and down the street. Anything that gets in their way is taken out and this has to stop.</P>
    <P>We must make the streets safe again so that people are free to walk them. We must encourage people to come out and walk the streets, and we must address the situation where people are going to bed at 7 p.m. with their rosary beads, praying that they will get up in the morning and not be attacked in their homes. We have to deal with the thugs and criminals and this Bill will not do that.</P>
    <P>When new gardaí come out of Templemore, I want the Minister to make it part of their contract that they live where they are stationed. This is a simple thing. Gardaí should not be put into big Mercs with big perks; they should be put on the streets. However, if they are to be put on the streets they must have the necessary resources, and batons if they need them. If the general public and the Oireachtas support the Garda Síochána, it will do the job.</P>
    <P>We must also address the situation surrounding free legal aid. I do not mind people getting a chance. Anybody can make a mistake and the gardaí know people might go wrong once. However, if people continually come before the courts they must be dealt with. The softly-softly approach has to stop.</P>
    <P>In relation to late-night discos and chip shops, we must be able to bring in legislation if there are problems in these places. They now have licences and planning permission but the Garda Síochána should be given the powers to close down such places, whether for three days, ten days or ten weeks. If such premises continue to cause trouble the powers should be available to close them <Col N="651" /> down. The Act talks about these places policing themselves. We do not want bouncers doing this. We saw how bouncers behave. If they are given uniforms they get carried away. As Deputy Deasy said, these people create more problems than they solve. There is only one organisation in this country to protect the people and that is the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Minister might not know that my grandfather helped to set up this State. He was the first Assistant Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, Joseph Ring. Of course, if he had been Fianna Fáil there would be plaques all over the State for him but, because he was not, there are none. That is probably why the Minister does not know of him. The Garda Síochána was 75 years in existence last year and if one reads the history of that organisation my grandfather was well represented in it and well spoken of. He was like myself and believed in law and order. When he was needed to help clean up the State, he helped, and when he was asked to take the side of the Free State, he did. If he had been Fianna Fáil, the Minister would probably be now naming streets and barracks after him but I do not mind about that. My family was a part of history and is very proud of that.</P>
    <P>I have always been a supporter of the Garda Síochána and do not believe its members have got the credit they deserve. Like other sections of society, gardaí get bad press and, like politics and other areas, the Garda Síochána includes the good, the bad and the ugly. We should be thankful that 99.9% of gardaí are good, honest, decent people. They do a good job without receiving great resources from the State. I hope that the Minister gets them on the street again and hope that they live where they are assigned to, whether it is Tallaght, Westport or Ballinrobe. They should get out among local communities so that they know the people there and what goes on. A part of the problem now is that gardaí are not living where they work. It would help if they did.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the worst country in Europe in relation to drink, and particularly under-age drinking. We must do something about the drink culture, as Deputy O'Sullivan has said. If a child is born in Ireland, there is a big party; on the day of the christening, there is now a new occasion where people go to hotels and have a big drinks party; if there is a football match, the first place to go when a cup is won is into the pub; if there is a funeral, they bury the person and then it is into the pub for the day. Everything is oriented towards the pub culture and it must be stopped. It is having an awful effect on society.</P>
    <P>Young people have never had as much money &ndash; they have too much money &ndash; and all they are concerned with is drinking. It is wonderful that they have never had to see bad times but we all know that the bad times are coming again after listening to the Minister for Finance yesterday. Perhaps it will curtail young people a little if they do not have as much money. However, we must <Col N="652" /> do something about law and order. We must make our streets safe, protect the people, give the Garda Síochána the resources and get the courts to deal with those who continually break the law. The sympathy for the drink culture has to stop.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I hope the Minister makes a better effort than he did today although my party will support the Bill in principle anyway. My party spokesman will bring forward many amendments and I hope that the Minister will accept them because we all support change from the current situation. Everybody wants safe streets, and to see people protected and free to walk the streets of our towns. The Government must play its part. The previous Minister, supposedly responsible for zero tolerance, let us down and the people know that he let us down.</P>
    <P>The current Minister is now the great white hope. I have no doubt that as a man who believes in law and order, he will make safety the number one issue and reclaim the streets from the thugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaeSextonPD" hpid="Ms Sexton Ms Sexton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Sexton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the proposed legislation is to complement and strengthen the existing body of legislation, in particular, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. Unfortunately, statistics have shown beyond contradiction that alcohol abuse is the single most important element in public order offences. Existing legislation has tried in vain to combat alcohol abuse, particularly among the young. In addition, the introduction of measures to close down offending licensed premises has been welcomed and does not impinge on the rights of the vast majority of law abiding licence holders.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the best efforts of District Court judges, it has been the view of the Government that further measures are required. I am pleased that these proposals are now being introduced in a Bill and that provisions will be made on Committee Stage to ensure the Act comes into force within a month of being passed.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises the fundamental rights of citizens and visitors, many of whom, unfortunately, have been assaulted and robbed. This spiralling pattern cannot be permitted to continue unabated and the Government is determined to make the appropriate legislation available to the courts by way of innovative and radical measures.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that those convicted under sections 4 to 9, inclusive, of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, may by order be excluded from entering or being in the vicinity of certain types of premises between specified hours. It has been recognised that fast food premises feature regularly in late night public order offences and incidents. Rather than targeting such venues, the proposed measures seek first to protect the owners of the outlets and their property and, secondly, to afford their patrons the right to frequent such places in peace and without fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is refreshing about the proposed legislation is that it recognises a variety of other prem<Col N="653" /> ises such as venues associated with dancing and gaming which, unfortunately, have become blackspots. Orders may relate to the user of these places and the Bill provides an expansive definition which will no longer restrict the useful work of the courts. It is of considerable benefit that those who serve sentences may face exclusion orders on release and that the sanctions are both severe and meaningful. One hopes this will act as a further deterrent for those who persist with anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>The second radical measure in the Bill is the power to make closure orders on foot of an application to the courts by a member of the Garda Síochána. To be fair to licensees, the Garda is obliged in section 4(2)(<i>a</i>) to inform licensees that in its opinion the disorder or noise has occurred. I urge the House to consider that the obligation to inform the licensee be in writing, together with the request to take appropriate action as set out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), and the possibility of extending the &ldquo;reasonable period&rdquo; from seven to 14 days.</P>
    <P>These amendments would serve to eliminate confusion and obviate any misunderstandings that might arise. I urge that the notice in section 4(3) be in writing and be served by personal service or pre-paid registered post to the licensee and that the subsection be expanded to include licensees and nominees.</P>
    <P>I suggest that section 5(5) be reconsidered. It should be a matter for the presiding judge to direct when the order commences as the approach suggested in the Bill is too cumbersome and has no defined period within which the order shall be served. With regard to section 5(6) the publication of the order in a newspaper with local circulation should be within the discretion of the presiding judge. I also suggest that the maximum fines should be increased to obviate the necessity to revisit the legislation in the near future. I also welcome the applicability of the Bill to companies.</P>
    <P>As this is the first time I have spoken in the House, I must say that I listened with great interest to the contributions of Members on the Bill. I was surprised and alarmed by some of their comments and I am delighted that they do not have a free hand to make laws on this matter and that there are people here who would keep them in check. While I compliment Deputy Deasy on his speech, I was horrified at some of the measures, including stun guns, he wishes to have introduced to control young people who are binge drinking. This would be extremely excessive and I sincerely hope it receives the publicity it deserves in the national newspapers. As a young man, he has probably had the odd tipple himself.</P>
    <P>The reality is that serious crime has declined significantly during the past five years with public order offences making up just 2.1% of prosecutions for criminal activity. We are losing the run of ourselves by suggesting the &ldquo;hang-'em-and-flog-'em&rdquo; type approach to young people. <Col N="654" /> Clearly, the culture which has emerged in the past ten years, probably due to affluence and the availability of money to young people, has allowed binge drinking to occur which, unfortunately, is leading to public order offences. Nevertheless, we need to take a measured approach to legislation and examine other areas to find ways in which we can tackle underage and binge drinking. This will require moving into the realms of education and rehabilitation in the case of young people of 25 years and above given that they will not have learned that they cannot continue to live lives of binge drinking and public order offences.</P>
    <P>I come from a town which has a fair share of chip shops open until 3 a.m. and people coming intoxicated from nightclubs and causing public order offences. However, we need to look at this issue in a balanced way which is best for all of society. While we want law and order, we do not want a police state. There is nobody running riot on the streets of my constituency at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. waking and terrorising old people. While this perhaps happens in certain areas, the perception one would have from the comments in this Chamber is that there is no law and order. This is a reflection of the Opposition's unfair view of the Garda Síochána and the way its members perform their duties. Considerable resources have been made available to the Garda during the past five years and the Government is committed to a further increase of 2,000 in Garda numbers. This will be done in consultation with the parties concerned which means that the Garda will identify its needs to the Government, which will then act.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong to leave the House with the view that society has broken down and anarchy reigns. Public order offences make up 2% of the crime problem. The Bill is very balanced and fair to all concerned. It gives everyone caught up in public order problems, including those in the chip shops and public houses, a chance to try to put their house in order. Should this, coupled with education of our young people as to the dangers of binge drinking, not work, the Government will re-examine the issue to find out how we can strengthen the legislation. We have to take a step by step approach.</P>
    <P>I am more than surprised by the contributions of some of the Opposition Members, some of whose proposals could not possibly be introduced. Is the Opposition arguing that we need to lock up and curfew young people to ensure they do not binge drink? What is required is education, an area in which significant sums of money will be directed to ensure young people understand the long-term implications of binge drinking. As I stated, these comments are not part of my prepared speech, but a response to the unexpected &ldquo;hang-'em-and-flog-'em&rdquo; type statements from the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his brief. I expected to hear him articulate a vision of his own or that of the Government on the serious issue of public dis<Col N="655" /> order. Perhaps he will do so when he has had time to settle into his brief. I am interested to know his philosophy and vision on this area. It is of such a serious nature that perhaps he is right to take time to develop a vision regarding it.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Sexton to the House, but I bring to her attention the Minister's own words, &ldquo;wanton violence, thuggery and destructiveness are increasingly obvious symptoms of a decline in public order&rdquo;. It was not the Opposition who said that, it was the Minister. I welcome the recognition by the Minister that there is a problem because the previous Government was in denial that a problem existed, in spite of the fact that young people across the country are increasingly afraid to go onto the streets at night. This fear has to be addressed to ensure people feel safe again. I acknowledge that, in one sense, fear can be as destructive as some of the incidents that have occurred. People are afraid because serious events have led to people being killed while there are others on life support machines in hospitals as well as those who have been badly injured. The frequency of such occurrences is on the increase.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Bill appears to centre on two issues, the setting up of exclusion orders and closure orders. The Minister also said, &ldquo;There is no greater incentive towards good behaviour than having the issue of a possible custodial sentence deferred in order to assess the capacity of a convicted public order offender to adjust his or her social behaviour to comply with decent norms&rdquo;. That is fine if a person is thinking rationally but as some colleagues have indicated, people who are under the severe influence of alcohol and other substances do not think rationally. The idea of a deterrent does not work when people are out at night drinking shots and taking all kinds of substances.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach so far lacks any examination of the underlying reasons young men, in particular, feel the need to go out at night binge drinking and engaging in wanton thuggery and violence and destructiveness, to use the words of the Minister. The Minister is dealing with the symptom rather than the cause. Exclusion orders are fine but they do not deal with underage people who purchase cans of beer and spirits at a profit from older people who have bought them in off-licences. The Bill does not and cannot deal with this issue. I do not know how any legislation could.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister rightly attributed some blame for the present situation to the fact that young people now have money, but although they have money they do not have facilities and activities in which to take part. Most young people will say there is nowhere to go except the pub. This is an important point, yet the vision to deal with it is sadly lacking. The Government has failed in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question today to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government as to whether the Government has recon<Col N="656" /> sidered its policy on high density housing. During the term of the previous Government masses of houses were built without any amenities such as sports halls or playing fields. The youth service is virtually non-existent which means young people go out onto the streets at night with nowhere to go except the pub or some corner where they can buy alcohol. Peer pressure on them is enormous.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression that I am in any way soft on crime. One of the most basic rights of a citizen is to be able to walk the streets and the roads in safety but that is sadly lacking at present. We have to put in place measures to ensure people are safe, although some of them might be unpalatable. In other countries there is a high police presence in the evenings at flashpoints and while they may be somewhat intimidating in aspect they provide a necessary deterrent. However, that is not the case here where one can walk the streets at night without seeing a garda. I am not blaming the Garda, but as other Members have pointed out, we must examine whether Garda resources are being properly and fully used.</P>
    <P>In the context of the use of Garda resources, is there a policy in the Department or the Garda hierarchy to have a form of quota system for on-the-spot fines for driving? Is it true that every Garda division is expected to forward so many thousands of euros to the Department at the end of every month, without which a sanction is imposed or they get their knuckles rapped? Does this, for example, lead to Mrs. Brown being fined £50 for doing 43 m.p.h. in a 40 m.p.h. zone when she is coming home with her shopping rather than being cautioned for exceeding the speed limit and being told to slow down the next time? I want to find out if this is Government policy, departmental policy or Garda policy. Is that the best use of Garda resources? I have seen gardaí in 40 m.p.h. zones with speed guns held out and people driving at 42 and 43 m.p.h. being stopped.</P>
    <P>In some areas the 40 m.p.h. limit seems to extend half a mile down a dual carriageway. On coming out of Cork city towards Middleton in my constituency the 40 m.p.h. limit extends a long way down the dual carriageway. This does not make sense. A former Minister for the Environment and Local Government indicated at one point that he would change that. There is an urgent need to reassess the use of Garda resources and the need for gardaí to be visible on the streets of our towns and villages. The current policy appears to be to close down Garda stations around the country and to move gardaí out of rural villages and even some towns. I believe Mitchelstown is to be downgraded and there is also talk of downgrading the Garda station in Youghal. Will the Minister look at this policy? The Minister is new in the job. If downgrading is taking place, will he reverse that policy?</P>
    <P>Instead of shutting down Garda stations, he should ensure there are Garda personnel in towns and villages around the country. As Deputy Ring said, gardaí who live in the larger rural areas get <Col N="657" /> to know the community and the strangers. People come to them if there is something strange happening in the area. It is a bad day's work to move gardaí out of such places. Will the Minister re-examine that policy and reverse it if possible because it does not make sense?</P>
    <P>I would like to see the gardaí being released to do the work we expect them to do &ndash; to be guardians of the peace. If possible, if there is a problem with manpower, we should engage civilian workers and personnel to do a lot of the work the Garda is tied down doing at the moment. Perhaps the Minister will examine that area and see if we can reduce the number of gardaí doing work that civilians could do in a better way.</P>
    <P>The exclusion order stops people going into certain premises and being around certain areas. The closure order refers to closing premises and that kind of thing. I do not know how effective that will be. Will it just move the problem somewhere else? If somebody is drunk and disorderly in a certain area and one closes a premises down, will it move the problem somewhere else, concentrate it and perhaps exacerbate it in another area?</P>
    <P>I wonder about the amount of time and resources that will be required to implement this Bill if it is to be enacted. Has the Minister looked at how much Garda time, resources, bureaucracy and paperwork will be required to implement it? It seems that it will demand an awful lot of resources. We would be better off having police on our streets rather than behind desks doing paperwork.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's Department is very much involved in deterring people from crime, particularly young people. I ask him to ensure that work continues because it seems to be filling a vacuum. As I said in my opening remarks, there is no adequate youth service at all. There are certainly no youth centres in most urban areas. In other words, there is no place for youngsters to go.</P>
    <P>For instance, I was in Cobh on Monday evening and I visited a centre there, for want of a better term. It consists of one small room. There was a pool table in it, on which three or four youngsters were playing. They told me they had nowhere to go and nothing to do. In Cobh, there is no swimming pool, community centre, theatre or cinema. In a town of 12,500 people there is nothing only pubs. A Justice recently commented on the public order problem in Cobh. That is indicative of problems all over the country.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is at the Cabinet table, will he press his colleagues to ensure that facilities such as swimming pools, sports halls and playing fields are made available in communities? Instead of building vast, sprawling housing estates and wondering afterwards what are the youngsters to do, let us plan to put in playing fields, community centres and sports halls first and then build the houses around them, like they do in other countries. That is the kind of Government vision I <Col N="658" /> would like to see, which I do not see at present. I have been speaking about this in past years, but it is not happening. The problem is actually getting worse. In fact, recently in Carrigtwohill An Bord Pleanála decided &ndash; I know this is not the Government's problem &ndash; to uphold planning permission to build high-rise flats. There are no facilities for youngsters. This will haunt us in the years ahead. People in the future will ask why people in 2002 were so stupid they did not put in facilities for people.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in his speech that he will ensure the streets are policed. We will be watching closely to ensure that happens. We want to see increasing evidence of properly equipped police on the streets. If police have to deal with a riot, as happens, it is not right that they should merely wear a light yellow bib and a soft cap. They should be dressed properly and have proper safety equipment in case they get attacked and to prevent them from being seriously injured.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to address the issue of off-licences, which I do not think is addressed in the Bill. Has the Minister any proposals at all to deal with off-licences? How does he propose to prevent people from going into off-licences, buying alcohol and selling it on to younger people? How does he propose to prevent younger people themselves going into off-licences?</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's views on ID cards, as mentioned by Deputy Deasy? They have been spoken about for a long time and it is time that somebody grasped the nettle in this respect. We should have some form of proper identification such as cards of high quality that cannot be forged very easily.</P>
    <P>During the election, the need for public order and people's fear in this respect comprised one of the big issues that arose in every constituency, both rural and urban. The introduction of closed-circuit television is a great help and I would like to see it used more widely.</P>
    <P>We will be watching the Minister and the Government closely with regard to public order. This is a Band-Aid Bill. It does not do an awful lot. It will tie up resources all over the place.</P>
    <P>We also need to put in place measures to assist young people who come out of prison. There is very little support for them and they go back into crime again. The Minister needs to address that. Recently, I came across a young man who applied for a job in a health board. Thirteen years ago he was fined for taking a jacket or something and this was held against him. He was told he could not get a job in the health board. There is something wrong in the public service when that happens. Perhaps we need to be a bit more flexible in that regard.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might amend some of the measures in the Bill, as has been suggested even by people on his side of the House. We will wait and see what his vision and philosophy will be in the months, and possibly years, ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Caoláin.</P>
      <P>This is a dangerous and flawed Bill. It comes at a time when the credibility of the Garda has been damaged badly in the wake of the violence of its members at the Mayday &ldquo;Reclaim the Streets&rdquo; demonstration. The Bill is a threat to the civil liberties of the citizens of this State. Instead of threatening chip shop owners, we should be targeting the owners of the large pubs who are serving alcohol to customers who are already drunk. The owners of these premises and their staff have an enormous responsibility, which they have obviously not honoured in the recent past. We should be targeting those super-pubs which have sprung up in recent years and which have tarnished the image of Ireland and the communities that they reputedly serve.</P>
      <P>We should be asking the Garda why there have been no prosecutions under the Intoxicating Liquor Act instead of initiating new, dangerous and flawed legislation. There is legislation to prosecute publicans who are serving drunk individuals on their premises. However, it appears not to have been used by the Garda.</P>
      <P>We should be looking at the real causes. We should be looking at alcohol itself and the fact that there is no health warning given with it, whether it be a bottle of whiskey or a bottle of beer. There should be some kind of health warning with alcohol because it is a dangerous and sometimes deadly drug. We should target the advertisers and providers of alcohol. Why can our national flag be tarnished by the logo of a brand, Guinness, which is owned by Diageo, a multinational company? It has defaced the national flag and allowed it to be used as an advertisement for its product. Why is the same company hanging some of the largest advertisements and banners in the history of the State to advertise a new product from its range, Ice-Cold Guinness? Why do we allow alcohol to have such domination over our culture? We should target those companies and the advertising they use. As my colleague has suggested, we should look for alternatives. We should provide amenities in communities in which there is little to do on a Friday night other than go to a large pub. In any city in Germany or France large municipal swimming pools can be found which are open until 10.00 p.m. There are decent local coffee shops and cinemas that give young people in particular an alternative to pubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ludicrous that the Minister proposes to target chip shop owners in this legislation. It is not the Burdocks, the Borzas or any owners of chip shops who should be targeted. It is those who own very large pubs. A cartel of publicans has built enormous drinking barns in which the staff cannot and do not bother to check whether their customers are drunk before they serve them. These superpubs have crept up in recent years and this Government and the previous one have done nothing to address their emergence. It has perpetuated the situation and it has perpetuated <Col N="660" /> the cartel that controls and dominates the licensing industry.</P>
    <P>It is a dangerous step to introduce new criminal justice or public order legislation because there has been an increase in the use of this legislation against political protesters. Those charged under the current legislation in recent months include members of the Irish Anti-War Movement and cyclists, who were charged on 22 September last year &ndash; which was supposed to be European Car Free Day. This is a dangerous precedent and it is a step in the wrong direction to introduce new legislation that could be abused in this manner. Not only last September but also more recently, on May Day in Dublin, we saw members of the public charged under the criminal justice legislation &ndash; members of the public who were taking part in a Reclaim the Streets demonstration. All of these were peacefully protesting about issues of immediate concern to the public, yet the Minister appears to be giving the gardaí enhanced powers in this regard. Even in recent weeks, employees of the clamping company, Control Plus, were arrested under the public order legislation. I know the clampers in Dublin are not everybody's favourite people but to charge members of Control Plus under this legislation is to set a bad precedent.</P>
    <P>Instead, we should be breaking down the cartel that controls the very large pubs from which most of the problems emanate. My party's submission to the Commission on Liquor Licensing suggested that we need to retain the small-scale family pub where the owner is the operator and knows who is drinking, who is not, who is drinking too much and when to stop serving. This is preferable to drinking barns that pay minimum wages and have all the atmosphere of an airport departure lounge, where the person serving behind the counter has no idea how intoxicated the customer is.</P>
    <P>In short, we need to pass on more responsibility to the owners of these premises, reform the Garda and break up the cartels. The citizens and chip shop owners of this State should not be targeted with this retrogressive legislation. Instead, we should target alcohol advertising and create more amenities for the communities in which there is little to do in the evening other than go to the local pub. The focus should also be on city and county managers who give permission for enormous superpubs and the gardaí should be charged with using their existing responsibilities more wisely. Citizens should not be targeted by this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am hoping against hope that the common note that I will strike in relation to the Bill before us this evening will set <Col N="661" /> a pattern for the future. Like one earlier speaker, I am not absolutely convinced of that, but time will tell. This legislation responds to the growing scourge of anti-social behaviour, including violent assaults and murders, associated with late night drinking. We do not need statistics to tell us the extent of this scourge in our cities and towns and even in rural areas. Anyone who goes out for a social drink nowadays will have experienced, directly or directly, the type of behaviour that instils fear and makes our streets unsafe. The behaviour of a small but violent minority of people has made socialising a less relaxed and less enjoyable experience for the majority. For many people, particularly older people, who live in the neighbourhood of pubs, clubs and hotels where this behaviour can be at its worst, a night-time rest, even in their own homes, is unknown at weekends. Rowdiness at all hours of the night and damage to homes is common and my own mother, a senior citizen, has experienced this. I am speaking from that perspective. For older people the weekend can often be one long nightmare.</P>
      <P>Hoteliers and publicans, while neither solely nor wholly responsible, must nevertheless take more responsibility for what goes on in and around their premises. They must take more responsibility for the state of intoxication of their patrons. By and large, the licensed trade in this country is hugely profitable. There are now bigger and more profitable clubs, pubs and hotels than ever before. That is broadly welcome. There have never been more people out socialising at weekends and there has never been more money to spend. All of these are equally welcome. It must be said that the majority of young people who spend their hard-earned money at weekends act responsibly and with respect for other members of the community. The minority responsible for anti-social behaviour are by no means all young people. This is something that needs to be emphasised, for fear of young people as the sole perpetrators becoming the focus of this debate. That is anything but the truth.</P>
      <P>The knee-jerk reaction from some quarters is simply to blame alcohol and urge further restrictions on its sale and on opening hours. The logical extension of that is the mentality which led to the disastrous experiment of Prohibition in the USA. During the last Dáil the opening hours of pubs were extended. I have heard very few people arguing that the extended hours led to more of the type of behaviour we are addressing in this Bill. I do not believe that the extended hours worsened the situation. They may even have eased it to some extent. I will repeat what I said at the time the legislation was passed &ndash; we should aim for even fewer restrictions on opening times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the concentration of violent drunken behaviour in the early hours of the morning is that venues are all spilling out intoxicated patrons at the same time. We must consider open-ended arrangements and, if the <Col N="662" /> Minister will pardon the pun, staggered closing times to reduce the concentration of crowds in the early hours. I have no objection in principle to most of the penalties set out in this Bill including the power to exclude persons convicted of certain offences from named premises and the power to place restrictions on premises. However, I will revisit the detail of others because the focus is perhaps misdirected. We will have an opportunity to address this in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of the principal problems is the failure of the Garda Síochána to implement existing legislation. There may be a variety of reasons for this, including a lack of manpower and resources and there may also be a certain unwillingness at some levels and in some places. The Garda now has wide powers in the area of public order but we have, unfortunately, seen these powers abused in certain high profile cases in pursuit of personal grudges against individuals or against certain licensed premises where an even-handed approach is not applied. We all know instances from our local communities where this mentality has been demonstrated on numerous occasions. I do not think there is a town in the country in which people cannot identify those pubs in which a late drink can be acquired and those in which one cannot. We want to see an even-handed approach and the existing laws applied fairly. At the same time, reasonable powers already in the hands of the Garda are often not applied.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need to ensure the presence of an adequate number of gardaí, properly resourced, at and nearby local venues where local knowledge will inform the level of policing required. Most people would support this measure, as previous speakers have done. I have seen the difference that approach has made when representations were made through a local chief superintendent to provide for a presence at a particular spot where there were recurring offences. Due to the physical presence of gardaí, people were not subjected to anti-social behaviour but when it was withdrawn, the problems recurred.</P>
    <P>Why can we not have greater numbers of properly trained and skilled gardaí on our streets dealing effectively with problems at the times when local knowledge has established are the worst? This is when we need proper utilisation of the resource the Garda Síochána provides in terms of service to the communities.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not address the problem whereby so-called &ldquo;bouncers&rdquo; are often the perpetrators of violence and the cause of trouble at venues. Legislation in this regard is promised and is long overdue because it is well known that a blind eye by the gardaí is often turned to the crimes of bouncers which can only further poison the climate of menace and violence on our streets at night.</P>
    <P>We must also address the wider social context &ndash; something a limited Bill such as this cannot hope to do. Issues which need to be addressed in our CPSE classes in secondary schools include <Col N="663" /> our attitude to alcohol and the reality of older people's fears. The view I express concerning opening times is not one of contraction but rather a freeing up of the situation for the logical reasons of management of premises, security on our streets and the inadequacy of public transport. Lack of transport is particularly critical in our towns and cities as it gives rise to crowds and an interface between people who have probably long passed the ability to reason any situation. It is vital to ensure people are brought home safely from venues late at night. I hope this new Dáil and this Minister will address these matters in a serious and determined manner and I look forward to further engagement on this Bill as it progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I wish him &ndash; perhaps not joy &ndash; but an interesting time in office. As previous Deputies have said, the question of public order in relation to drinking and the late night violence which has so disfigured streets, towns and villages across the country is one of the worst problems that faces Irish society. Unlike many of the problems that relate to criminality and anti-social behaviour, it is not confined simply to one section of the community. It is remarkable how ill-behaved even well-off people can be when they have consumed excessive quantities of drink. The usual analysis that crime and anti-social behaviour is caused by social deprivation is obviously not the case in relation to the squalor and disorder of the problems given rise to by excessive drinking.</P>
      <P>This Bill is, however, a classic sticking plaster with much detail about what to do after a crime has been committed but almost nothing about what can be done to solve the causes of this type of crime and anti-social behaviour. As other Deputies have said, the Bill contains no provision for reducing alcohol consumption or for providing alternative facilities, particularly for young adults and older teenagers who are the key people caught up in this problem. One of the concerns I have in relation to the Bill is in the section dealing with the exclusion order and perhaps the Minister will deal with this on Committee Stage. There are no details of what the gardaí or the courts should take into account when deciding on an exclusion order which is a draconian power if and when it is used. A number of cases are outlined in the Minister's speech and in the memorandum about when exclusion orders may be used or when they may be indicated or requested by the gardaí, but this is unsatisfactory because one must ask if these arbitrary decisions about exclusion orders are made by gardaí perhaps based on bias? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us to the question of the approach of the gardaí to policing and theirs powers. All of us who serve communities where there is a great deal of anti-social behaviour, crime and disorder know that the only real way to deal with the prob<Col N="664" /> lem is to have sufficient numbers of gardaí patrolling the streets and getting to know the communities. There is no other solution to this problem. In cities in the United Kingdom and particularly in America, the only thing that has worked in terms of solving this problem is a return to community-based policing. Such a method of policing would be particularly effective in tackling the problems of public disorder arising from excessive consumption of alcohol. My constituency of Dublin West, including Blanchardstown, now has a population larger than that of the city of Limerick, which is in the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea. This urban area, larger than Limerick city, has just one Garda station. During the lifetime of the last Government, this area lost more than a third of its community policing service. Instead we have a Fiat Panda, the pride and joy of our police force in Dublin 15, which occasionally travels around with two to four gardaí on board. Having driven around various estates all night, it is inevitable that, when the gardaí go to the scene of a disturbance they will not be able to establish the real cause of any problem. Because they are covering too much ground, they are losing the ability to have any indepth knowledge of the communities they are policing. They have no way of distinguishing between those people who are continuous offenders and those who are merely congregating in a place. On occasion, the gardaí will get it wrong, therein sparking the development of huge resentment among younger people who feel they have been wrongly accused of wrongdoing. I feel sorry for those younger members of the force who are asked to deal &ndash; in what I feel is a very poor manner &ndash; with and manage situations that develop on our streets.</P>
    <P>In an area such as Blanchardstown, and in most of the developing areas around each of our cities, one will not find a small local pub. Instead, we have what have been correctly described in Africa as &ldquo;beer halls&rdquo;. We are not talking about a pub with 50 or 100 patrons consuming a drink in a neighbourhood environment where the publican is in a position to have a reasonable knowledge of who the customers are and what threat they may pose. Instead, we have pubs which are built for hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of patrons. In Dublin 15, a pub licence will not be granted to any development of less than 2,500 to 3,000 houses. That is the planning norm. It follows the guidelines set down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. If we are serious about addressing the problem of drink-related public order offences, we must question this policy of building enormous beer halls. It is too difficult for anyone, including the Garda, to police these venues effectively.</P>
    <P>A consequence of this proliferation of beer halls has been the increase in the hiring of large numbers of bouncers. Bouncers decide, for reasons best known to themselves, whether they like the look of somebody or not. When they <Col N="665" /> decide to refuse admission to a person, resentment builds up and we all know about the type of violent incident which can then occur &ndash; such incidents have featured prominently in the newspapers. We are placing this additional resource out there in place of Garda power and suggesting to the public that this will solve our problems. I do not think this is a solution. In some situations, if the gardaí do not use these new powers in a sensitive manner they will only exacerbate the problem.</P>
    <P>In the section which deals with the venues and locations that will be subject to this legislation, I notice that chip shops and chip vans are mentioned. I do not have a problem with that. In some parts of Dublin, chip vans sell more than just chips. In other areas, such vans are well-run and provide an essential service, particularly in new housing estates where there are no other facilities. However, this legislation does not mention those merchants who go around the estates selling drink. Anybody who represents a Dublin constituency is well aware of this phenomenon. These people are driving around in vans selling drink and they do not care about the age of their customers. As with the sale of contraband cigarettes, such illegal behaviour is very often part of larger criminal networks, yet it is not included in this legislation. These vans are not included in the list of bodies which will be targeted by this legislation. I presume that the Minister would argue that, as such vans are illegal in the first place, additional legislation is not necessary. However, why not target what is one of the biggest causes of this public order problem? </P>
    <P>The granting of further powers to the Garda highlights the even greater need for accountability and transparency in that organisation. The Labour Party has, as the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is aware, already proposed detailed legislation in relation to the accountability of the Garda Síochána, including a police ombudsman. For the sake of the members of the force who are being asked to carry out these new measures, we must have better accountability. We do not know what the Government's detailed proposals in relation to the inspectorate are. This could be another example of dead-letter legislation or it could be implemented reasonably and carefully by the Garda. It could also be abused and implemented in an unfair way.</P>
    <P>Until we address the issue of community-based policing, we are not going to get any solution to the problems addressed by this legislation. There are not enough meetings with public representatives. Things are slightly better in my own area because I have finally persuaded the local garda superintendent to meet members of the local council roughly every three months. All of the political parties take part in these meetings, where the superintendent gives a detailed report of the incidence of this type of crime in our area and we have a discussion about what can be done about it. This is useful, but it is purely informal <Col N="666" /> and is down to the goodwill of the gardaí in my particular area. There is no reason why this model can not be extended across the rest of the State. At least we could then discuss these problems. We could ask why there are no gardaí outside a particular pub or take-away at night, if these places are the source of disturbance.</P>
    <P>Hospital accident and emergency departments are like war zones. At the weekends and on Thursday nights also, the facilities of hospitals such as the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown are taken up by people suffering from the effects of excessive consumption of alcohol. Many health care professionals are concerned by this. Owners of large licensed premises continue to serve drink to people who have clearly already consumed too much alcohol. Such people should not be encouraged to purchase more drink. In parts of Scandinavia, there is an onus on publicans to ensure that people who are drunk are not served any more alcohol. In some cases, action can be taken against publicans who continue to serve such customers.</P>
    <P>The experiment of the extension of pub opening hours is one we need to re-examine. There is an argument for it in certain areas but not in residential areas where there are very large pubs and very late opening hours. One must remember that, under planning laws, the average take-away may stay open for an hour and a half after the last pub closes. That means that in parts of Blanchardstown village, for instance, the last take-away can close at around 3.30 a.m. That is simply too late. Where there are people who have consumed a lot of drink queuing, it is a focus for disorderly conduct and indeed for some of the tragic incidents we have witnessed.</P>
    <P>I find the lack of emphasis by the Government on how to deal with a reduction in alcohol consumption, particularly among younger people, disappointing. We have not as yet addressed the question of the advertising of alcohol which is critical to its popularity. Next September and October, as in every other year, all our major universities and third level institutions will offer cheap drink to students through all sorts of clubs and societies. As somebody who occasionally speaks at clubs and societies, it is almost impossible to get a non-alcoholic drink. People would look at one as if one had two heads if one suggested one might like water or, God forbid, worst of all, tea or coffee. We have a responsibility to start to change that culture, particularly in the case of a lot of women students. I say that as somebody who has worked in the third level area. I find it sad that many younger women are in a social environment in which they are almost forced to compete round for round with men very often drinking shorts.</P>
    <P>There are also these new drinks, including the combination of vodka and Red Bull and so on. As other speakers have said, one would not like to say what condition a young person who has consumed three or four vodkas and Red Bulls would be in because that combination contains <Col N="667" /> a very high level of caffeine plus alcohol. It is a combination which publicans should neither be encouraged nor allowed to sell to young people.</P>
    <P>The difference between our drink culture and that of most of our European counterpart countries is that when people drink, they also have something to eat whereas people here go out on the town for the evening having had nothing to eat. Even in eastern European countries, people are at least served bread and bread sticks in pubs so they are eating something. The impact of alcohol consumption is less than here, where people drink very often having eaten little all day and by the time closing time comes they are in an appalling state.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's intention in trying to address the problems of alcohol but this Bill is, as I said earlier, a bit of a sticking plaster in that it addresses the aftermath of the problem and crimes after they have been committed. If we are to get real about the problems of alcohol, we need to address the question of alcohol consumption, the advertising of alcohol and our planning laws and how they provide only for these large beer halls around the country. We also have to strike a balance between the interests of a small number of very large companies which now control the licensed trade and the interests of publicans with smaller family-sized pubs because, certainly in the greater Dublin area, there does not seem to be room for them anymore which is regrettable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill and the discussion on Second Stage. A wide variety of views have been expressed so far in the debate and that is very constructive. I have no doubt the 29th Dáil will be a very interesting one given what we heard to date in the debates which have taken place. At the outset, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on his appointment and wish him well in his new role.</P>
      <P>This Bill makes provision for exclusion orders to be imposed on a person facing conviction for a public order offence. It also allows for closure orders in regard to places where alcohol is sold and other places specified. These are necessary measures to deal with the problems of public disorder being experienced in our cities, towns and communities. In the recent general election crime, yet again, emerged as a very important issue of concern to the electorate. However, it is a certain type of crime which people want tackled effectively. The quality of life of our citizens is seen to be threatened by public disorder and anti-social behaviour generally by gangs, underage drinking, vandalism and lawlessness and by unprovoked attacks. This Bill aims to tackle these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be said that there are problems in relation to so-called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; in many suburban areas and separate measures will have to be taken to deal with this matter. The Garda say there is adequate legislation in place to deal with <Col N="668" /> the unauthorised taking of a vehicle. That may be the case but there is no doubt that so-called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo; is a menace in many of our communities and the Garda will have to adopt specific measures to deal with this problem in certain areas and encourage and become involved in activities to prevent young people from engaging in this very dangerous practice.</P>
    <P>In our communities parents, for example, are worried about their children going into the city centre at night for an evening's entertainment. Elderly people are afraid to go to and from Saturday evening Mass in some parishes of Dublin and elsewhere. Local parks and greens have, on occasion, become no-go areas for the residents of the locality. We are all familiar with these experiences in our role as public representatives. These gangs cannot be allowed to destroy community life as we have known it.</P>
    <P>As I have said previously in this House, the substantial economic growth of the past few years has literally transformed our society and I do not think we can underestimate the changes which have taken place in the last five years. The make up of this Dáil demonstrates the changes. New issues and new challenges have emerged which have to be tackled by Government. Young people are more affluent and it could be said in the context of the discussion on this Bill that some young people have too much money at their disposal. Alcohol consumption has increased and, directly related to this, late night public disorder has now become an issue of genuine concern.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a new aggression in our society and this has resulted in unprovoked attacks, random violence and street assaults generally against young people, particularly young men. This too must be a real worry given that often there does not seem to be a reason for these attacks. The enactment of this Bill will give the Garda some of the extra powers they need to combat this difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the outgoing Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. He introduced a great deal of legislation to deal with crime and he implemented a wide range of practical measures to fight it. His efforts to break up the drug gangs and to target the assets of the drug barons were especially effective. Only a short time ago it could be said that these so-called untouchables represented a real threat to our democracy. I wish Deputy O'Donoghue well in his new role and in his new Department.</P>
    <P>Several speakers referred to gardaí on the beat. Crime is a complex issue and resources must be deployed in many different ways to deal with the problem in its totality. Putting more gardaí on the beat seems likes a simplistic issue, yet it is what the people want and demand. It would go a long way in dealing with the type of crime addressed in this Bill. There are many complex matters to be addressed when dealing with crime generally, for example, white collar crime, or more recently crimes relating to pornography, etc., about which <Col N="669" /> there has been much publicity. The Garda need specialised training to deal with these matters. However, ultimately, the simple solution demanded by people throughout the years of putting more gardaí on the beat is the way to proceed to secure the right kind of climate for dealing with crime and the types of crime addressed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the strength of the Garda by 2,000. This will ensure a more visible Garda presence in our towns, cities and communities. I also welcome the policy, outlined in the programme for Government, to introduce a community warden service. This will free the gardaí to deal with other activities, including the types of crime associated with public disorder. I hope the introduction of such a system will be done speedily and that the necessary measures will be approved by the House as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to community policing and the role of the community sergeant or garda. I support the Garda community scheme. We need to be totally committed to it. The active involvement of gardaí in the community is of fundamental importance when dealing with crimes of public disorder and I hope the Garda Commissioner and the Garda are committed to community policing. In my constituency community sergeants and gardaí have been in place for many years. It is clear they are crucial to dealing with juvenile and other types of crime.</P>
    <P>However, in other districts community Garda personnel change every few months, which is unsatisfactory and defeats the purpose of the scheme. Community gardaí must be part of the community and be in place for several years so that they get to know an area. The Garda Commissioner should be committed to promoting this if the scheme is to work effectively.</P>
    <P>Operation Oíche and, more recently, Operation Encounter are welcome measures which aim to deal with problems of public disorder. I hope they will be maintained and promoted on a long-term basis. They have good aims and objectives and are necessary to address specific problems.</P>
    <P>I referred to the changes that have occurred in society. A change of much concern to me is the general lack of respect towards gardaí. There has been an across the board decline in respect for authority and authority figures, such as politicians, church leaders and the elderly. I have witnessed the decline in respect to the Garda on many occasions. Young gardaí especially appear to be unable to stand up for themselves at times. At public meetings they are subjected to discourtesy and abuse, not only from the young but also from middle aged citizens. This must be nipped in the bud. The Garda has a role to play and are backed up by the Constitution and the laws enacted in this Parliament. The Garda Commissioner should address this problem. While the Garda have to deal with problems at a macro <Col N="670" /> level, in their day to day activities we must restore the respect shown to gardaí to ensure they can fulfil their role.</P>
    <P>Many communities and parishes do not have community centres or youth cubs. This creates a problem because often the local pub is the only venue in which to hold meetings or conduct community activities. However, many of the problems referred to in this debate occur in pubs and in view of this it is unhealthy when communities have no alternative community venues. The problem must be addressed. During the term of the previous Government the then Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Tourism, Sport and Recreation made funding available for family resource centres, community development programmes and for sports and community facilities generally. I would like to see the new Ministers expand and develop these programmes. For example, the young people's services and facilities fund has played a major role in this area.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Programme for Government: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Hogan on Tuesday, 18 June 2002:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;conscious that there will be considerable additional pressure on the public finances to meet spending commitments in the areas of pay and infrastructure;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;believing that the prudent management of the economy in these challenging circumstances requires realistic and structured spending priorities and that the programme for Government should set the agenda for the nation, identify priorities and chart clear timetables for delivery;</P>
    <P Just="Center">condemns the Government parties for producing a programme which is largely aspirational, contains no costings, few measurable timeframes and no clear targets; and calls on the Government to immediately set out specific targets in key policy areas against which the success of their programme can be judged and the consequential budgetary framework for the next five years within which these commitments will be met.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;welcomes and supports the clear and specific Programme for Government agreed by the parties in Government, based on the manifestos endorsed by the electorate, <Col N="671" /> which create the framework for the continued development and enhancement of economic and social progress over the next five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Michael D. Higgins for agreeing to share his time. I wish to share my time with Deputy Ferris.</P>
      <P>The motion aptly states that the programme for Government should set the agenda for the nation for the five year period for which the Government is supposed to be in power, identify priorities and chart clear timetables. I agree with that. The Government's amendment states that it welcomes &ldquo;the Programme for Government agreed by the parties in Government&rdquo; and that it is &ldquo;based on the manifestos endorsed by the electorate&rdquo;. There is a contradiction in that some of the contents of the manifestos were specific while other parts were general. That is part of the problem with the programme for Government. It is very much a curate's egg.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on what I regard as the greatest fraud perpetrated on the people in relation to one specific area of An Agreed Programme for Government. This is the health issue, which is not specific in the programme although the manifesto that was put to the people was very specific. It was the single biggest issue that exercised the minds of the people during the course of the election and a large number of Independent candidates were elected to this House on the health issue.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto stated categorically that it would permanently end waiting lists in all our hospitals within two years through a combination of bed capacity, primary care, secondary care and targeted reform initiatives. That is extremely specific and that is what the electorate bought into. It is a scandal to say that An Agreed Programme for Government is based on the manifestos endorsed by the electorate and leave out the specifics. If one is specific in one's manifestos, one must be specific in one's programme. Fianna Fáil has done a very great injustice by immediately after the election going into Government with what is very much a right-wing party, the Progressive Democrats. We will get more of the same, but they are not now prepared to be specific about the delivery of what they promised specifically to the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is true in the case of another important area of service, housing. The scandal of homelessness trebled under the previous Administration and we are awaiting the outcome of the recent survey, about which all the indications are that there is a considerable increase again in the number of people who are homeless. Many of these homeless people took part in the anti-drugs march on the streets today. They encounter difficulties finding shelter in any circumstances, but this is a much wider issue. Few young people can afford to purchase a home at present and An Agreed Programme for Govern<Col N="672" /> ment does not contain specific details on how the Government will deal with the other scandal of the unprecedented prosperity in our country over the past five years but nothing to show for it in terms of providing basic services to the people.</P>
    <P>The last budget surplus was induced by sleight of hand. It is sad that the previous Government, which came into power in 1997 after the leader of my party, who was then Minister for Finance, had delivered the first surplus budget, left us with a much weakened economy and a budget which, when properly analysed, was not in surplus. It left an economy so weakened that our rate of inflation is more than double the European average, tax returns have fallen very low and we are not likely to reach budget targets. The Government has given no figures on increased spending in its programme and there is no budgeting whatsoever for benchmarking which is coming down the road at the end of the month. One commentator, Senator O'Toole, declared that benchmarking is equivalent to an ATM. The Government never corrected him and allowed expectations to rise at an inordinate rate. It has not put in place a budgeting mechanism to deal with benchmarking.</P>
    <P>An Agreed Programme for Government has very little to offer. It contains very few specifics. Where there were specifics in the manifestos, they have been left out in the programme. I do not expect to see much delivery of essential services, which determine a better quality of life for the people of this country, during the term of office of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Promises made, promises delivered was a slogan often used in the party political broadcasts of the majority partner in Government during the election campaign. Many promises and commitments were given in its election manifesto, some of which were laudable and others which were not.</P>
      <P>One such promise was to wipe out hospital waiting lists within two years. However, reading the programme for Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, it is more than clear that there was nothing more to this promise than the quick soundbite it provided the Taoiseach while on the campaign trail. For the majority partner in Government to back down on a fairly straightforward and categorical commitment suggests that the 29th Dáil will be littered with broken promises and continuing social injustice. Health care played a major part in the election campaign, probably more so than in any previous election campaign. This is because our health services have never been in such disarray and morale has never been so low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kerry is a microcosm of Irish society at large. Its urban areas have all the problems associated with urban areas the length and breadth of our country. Its rural areas suffer the same neglect as rural areas in Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Cork and Clare. In Tralee General Hospital, the waiting list stands at almost 3,000. There are genuine fears <Col N="673" /> for the future of cancer screening and treatment services at Tralee. There are no breast-screening facilities in Tralee and there are no full-time CAT scan facilities because there is no resident cardiologist. This is a disgrace because Tralee has a catchment area serving the entire county of Kerry and west Cork.</P>
    <P>Our public health service suffered a massive crisis while public finances were at an all-time high. The Celtic tiger roared for corporate Ireland while it whimpered in the corner as people lay dying on trolleys in public hospitals. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats cannot absolve themselves of responsibility for that. They sustained and promoted the conditions that saw the public finances of the many used to fund the private health care of the few. They sustained the conditions that ensured the rich got richer while those less well-off slipped further away. Their approach to health care is indicative of their approach to many aspects of society. &ldquo;If there is not a profit in it, it is not worth doing&rdquo; should be their motto. There is no sense of community welfare, no sense of community development or no sense of people.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland has suffered greatly as a result. Government policies have ensured that the family farm is on its way to extinction. There has been a drop of over 25% in farm incomes in the last four years. We need to proactively pursue rural regeneration as a priority. We must inject funding and commitment to develop the overall fabric of rural life. It means ensuring that those who wish to remain on the land can do so economically. It means developing our agri-tourism sector and protecting our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Beginning in the early 1970s with our accession to the Common Market, successive Governments have sold out the fishing industry. In exchange for subsidies, which primarily benefited larger farmers, our fishing rights in our own waters were abandoned wholesale. The latest proposals from Brussels are the final nail in that coffin. Fisheries and marine affairs have always been at the bottom of the agenda of Government. There is little in the programme for Government to convince us otherwise. The debate on the exclusion of the marine portfolio from departmental titles exposed that reality. The Taoiseach downgraded the importance of all aspects of the marine when allocating ministerial positions and was then obliged to row back.</P>
    <P>We need to offer equality of treatment to all citizens regardless of where they live. Sinn Féin will not be supporting the Government's amendment because it is built on the foundation of broken promises. It does not offer a chance of economic enhancement and social progress. It is a programme for Government that will continue the social injustices witnessed during the past five years. It is a programme for Government of the rich by the rich.</P>

      <P>I am proud to speak in support of the Government amendment to this Private Members' motion. I am pleased that we have been presented with a programme for Government. It is great, when beginning a new term of office, that a clear and specific agenda is laid out for the years ahead. People will judge us at the next general election on foot of whether we match up to what is contained in the programme, with which everyone should by now be familiar.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reappointment of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to his position. He proved to be a good Minister for Finance during the past five years. Most people recognise that the next five years may be more difficult from an economic point of view. I know the Minister's skills will be tested but he will prove extremely capable and able. I also welcome the appointment of Deputy Michael Ahern as Minister of State at the Department of Finance. Deputy Ahern served as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service in the previous Dáil and, as vice-chairman of that committee, I worked closely with him during its lifetime.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear the previous speaker refer to &ldquo;broken promises&rdquo;. That term is a popular cliché, but it has no relationship to reality in the context of the programme for Government with which we have been presented. When Fianna Fáil entered Government with the Progressive Democrats in 1997 it was the first occasion on which an Administration ever put in place such a clear programme for Government. I estimate that 99% of the contents of that programme were implemented in full. It is safe to say that since the foundation of the State no programme for Government was implemented to such an extent as that put in place by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in 1997. I have no doubt that the same will apply to the programme before us. It is, therefore, premature for anyone to refer to &ldquo;broken promises&rdquo;. We have set out in our document what we propose to do. It is a well researched and well thought out document and it recognises that, in economic terms, we may be facing a difficult period and that people cannot expect exact timescales or targets in respect of various changes in the economy. The Government must have the flexibility to ensure that, during its five year term of office, it can implement the document in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its election campaign, Fianna Fáil adopted the slogan &ldquo;A lot done. More to do&rdquo;. When watching television last night, I came across a new programme entitled &ldquo;More to do&rdquo;, and I take that as a compliment. It is clear that RTE and the people in general have recognised that the slogan was a fair and reasonable assessment of what the outgoing Government had achieved. We did a great deal in the past five years but we were first to acknowledge that more needs to be done. We did not go to the country saying &ldquo;We did a great <Col N="675" /> job, please return us to power.&rdquo;  We went to the people and stated that we had done a lot and that we had done our best but we recognise that more needs to be done. The people appreciated that level of honesty and openness from Fianna Fáil. We did not have stock answers prepared for every question we were asked during the campaign. We recognise that the job of government is ongoing and that we will continue to have to deal with problems as time passes.</P>
    <P>The issue of crime was raised on doorsteps throughout the country during the election campaign and it is well dealt with in the programme for Government. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform faces a tough task in the years to come. It is vital that more gardaí are placed on our streets in order that the myriad legislation passed by the outgoing Government can be implemented in full. That is the most important thing we must achieve in the coming years. There is a great deal of legislation on the Statute Book and we want to ensure that people feel safe in their homes, on streets and in estates and townlands. When their teenage children go out at night, parents must be able to rest safe in the knowledge that they will return safely from the disco or other venue where they have spent the evening. It is important that people enjoy such security and we want to ensure that they can do so.</P>
    <P>In some instances, greater vigilance will be required on the part of the Garda but there will also be a need for greater consistency on the part of the Judiciary. One need only consult the various provincial newspapers to see that people convicted of serious offences are regularly given probation or suspended sentences by members of the Judiciary when a term in jail might be more appropriate. Consideration must be given to this matter.</P>
    <P>As a representative of a midlands constituency, I am pleased the Government has singled out transport as a special area for attention. The new Minister in the area, Deputy Brennan, faces a major task in terms of upgrading road and rail infrastructure throughout the country. In the context of my constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, a number of new motorways are to be built and we must also increase the access in and out of Dublin in terms of the rail network. I hope this will happen in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the health strategy. The previous Government will be remembered as the Administration which gave free medical cards to everybody over 70 years of age. Many old people were afraid to go to their doctors because of the amount they would have to pay out of their old age pensions. I am proud that everyone in that age group now has access to a free medical card.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed itself to increasing the rate of old age pension to &euro;200 per week during its term of office. Five years ago we committed ourselves to increasing the same pen<Col N="676" /> sion to £100 per week. When we entered Government, the rate stood at approximately £72 per week and people thought we were making an outlandish promise. Not only did we achieve it &ndash; we set out to do so in five years but did so in under four &ndash; but we surpassed it. I hope we will also achieve our target of increasing the rate to &euro;200 sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Another example of the slogan &ldquo;A lot done. More to do&rdquo; is that the Government, during its previous term, introduced the minimum wage at a level which makes it the highest of its kind in Europe. People were concerned that this would have an impact on employment levels, but it has proven to be extremely beneficial. We did a lot in that regard but we now have more to do. In the next two budgets we must remove everyone on the minimum wage from the income tax net. We must ensure that there is consistency between the tax net and the earning capacity of people who are in full-time employment. I hope the minimum wage will increase and I also hope the social partners will agree to a new partnership deal in respect of the economy by next spring. The spirit of partnership between the Government, the trade union movement, employers and farming and other organisations was one of the cornerstones for the success of the economy and increases in employment in recent years.</P>
    <P>The main success from an economic point of view in the past five years was the change in circumstances of many people who had previously been living in poverty. I firmly believe that the best way to aid people living in poverty is to give them a job so that they can earn a decent income, support themselves, feel dignified by holding down employment, work hard and enjoy themselves. I hope that all those earning the minimum wage will be removed from the income tax net in the near future.</P>

      <P>I support the Government amendment to the motion. I congratulate Deputy McCreevy on his reappointment as Minister for Finance. He did an excellent job during the past five years, not only for the Government but also on behalf of the Parliament and the people. I congratulate my colleague from Cork, Deputy Michael Ahern, on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Deputy Ahern's background is in financial accounting and this will be of immense value to him when he undertakes the tasks set before him. He will do Cork proud in that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has set out a programme for the next five years, agreed by both parties, which will ensure the continued development of our economy. It will also ensure we achieve the objectives of our social inclusion programmes. Specific priorities are set out in the agreed programme and targets have been set. This is what the people voted for on 17 May. They expressed their satisfaction with the last five years of government and the previous Government's progamme. The vast <Col N="677" /> majority of the targets set were achieved. We must now build on and continue that work.</P>
    <P>I want to see further improvements in the quality of public services, improvements in services for older people and more increases for pensioners who worked so hard to make the country what it is today. I welcome the Government's commitment to increasing the old age pension to &euro;200 per week by 2007. I welcome the setting up of the national pensions reserve fund which plans for the future pension needs of all our older people. This was a huge step forward and will be a help to future Governments which will not have to provide the funds required to service this need. The workers of today will benefit from this fund when they reach pension age. I note that no member of the Labour Party is present. During the general election campaign that party proposed that the fund be raided and used for short-term spending. I am glad the electorate was wise enough to see that the fund is an important one. The main Opposition party supported the fund when it was set up and still does.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's decision to set up the new Department of Transport under the Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, with responsibility for major roads and public transport investment. We will have a better delivery of investment and improvements in this area when it is focused under a single ministry. I look forward to increased investment in roads and infrastructure in the Cork area in particular. I am sure my Cork colleague, Deputy Simon Coveney, shares my opinion on the importance of continued investment in Cork Airport. I am delighted tenders have been invited from interested parties, that &euro;100 million is to be expended on the airport and that two million passengers will go through it this year. Before the general election some Opposition candidates claimed this investment would not materialise but the beginning of the tendering process is an important step forward.</P>
    <P>We have seen improvements in bus investment in Cork city and hope to see more investment in rail services in the region. We will be pressing the Minister for Transport for money for the docklands development plan, where much spending on infrastructure is required. The south link road, the downstream crossing &ndash; the Jack Lynch tunnel &ndash; and the Blackpool bypass have been completed and the Watergrasshill and Ballincollig bypasses are in progress. A new north west link road is on the drawing board. This is needed in order that people can get to my office. I hope funds will be provided in order that it can be completed in the next five years.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government is based on the manifestos of the two Government parties and has been democratically endorsed by the electorate. The priorities are set on a solid budgetary base which seeks to maintain a balanced budgetary position for the next five years. It is entirely realistic since it is a continu<Col N="678" /> ation of the programme of the previous five years, which was hugely successful. Five years ago many said the programme set out then, which was much less detailed and specific than the current one, was entirely unattainable. In fact, more progress was made in several areas than was promised by the Government. For example, it delivered in excess of 300,000 new jobs and saw the rate of unemployment slashed from 10.3% to 3.9% in five years. It also saw the government debt to GDP ratio halved form 74% to 34% and left Ireland with the second lowest national debt in Europe. These are considerable achievements and no one would have believed it if they had been predicted five years ago.</P>
      <P>It is reassuring that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is committed to continuing to generate resources, using them prudently and seeking maximum value for money. We must face up to the fact that the State can only provide services if it can afford to pay for them. There are huge demands in many areas, particularly in health and education, which the programme plans to address. The budgetary policy must ensure they can be paid for. The policy as set out in the programme for Government can ensure this.</P>
      <P>Over the last five years expenditure on infrastructure increased from approximately &euro;2 billion in 1997 to almost &euro;6 billion this year. A strong case can be made for providing some kind of incentive payment for design teams on public projects to come in under budget. This is one place where the system does not lead to value for money and there seems to be an incentive to increase the cost rather than reduce it. This problem must be addressed in the short term.</P>
      <P>The national pensions reserve fund has been referred to by a number of speakers. It will fund pensions for today's workers. I am glad the Minister for Finance had the foresight to learn from the difficulties experienced by many of our European partners in the area of pensions and paying people who worked hard to create those strong economies. There have been generous pension increases in the past five years and this programme undertakes to continue that positive trend. However, there is one group of workers whose pension needs have not been looked after and whose case I have raised here on several occasions. They are the employees of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. The case of these pensioners must be addressed during the period of this Government.</P>
      <P>There have been huge increases in child benefit which have contributed positively to family income, particularly for mothers. This has been added to considerably by the reduction in tax rates which have led to much improved take-home pay for workers. The PAYE regime, together with the company tax regimes, encourage employment. This is important in a competitive global economy where there is a huge level of competition for employment providers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme includes a commitment to decentralisation. There was some disappointment <Col N="679" /> at the slow rate of progress in this area in the past five years but difficulties are being addressed. I trust they will be surmounted. The people of Kilrush would be slow to forgive me if I were not to mention the fact that they will be making a strong case in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am glad the programme makes positive mention of the Aer Rianta and other regional airports. The example of Shannon Airport and the wonderful response to the difficulties arising from the events of 11 September and changes in bilateral agreements must be saluted and recognised. There will be difficulties in the next five years. Those of us who have been prepared to take a stand for Shannon in the past will be prepared to do so in the future and will watch very closely any developments in this area.</P>
    <P>The health strategy is an integral part of the programme. I am delighted that the planned progress of Ennis General Hospital is moving forward apace. I understand interviews will be held over the next week for the design team. I am delighted that is happening. It would have been electorally advantageous had more progress been made before 17 May, but the commitments entered into before that will be fulfilled under this programme.</P>
    <P>The ongoing delay with the Ennis bypass was also of considerable electoral significance. That is a matter we will be watching closely on this side of the House. I see one of my new colleagues is here and he will be watching from the Opposition perspective. I can assure everybody in Government and elsewhere that there will be a strong and effective watching brief from this side. We intend to ensure that project continues. The NRA has already commenced two huge projects in County Clare, the Newmarket bypass which was recently opened in part and its continuation to Shannon. That is only part of the story and we intend to ensure it continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for tabling this opportune motion. At the start of the Dáil term it is correct to discuss An Agreed Programme for Government. I am delighted to be able to contribute to that discussion and support the amendment tabled by the Minister. The programme contains 30 pages of closely spaced small print set out in a comprehensive and easily readable form. When the programme is implemented our small country will be a more caring and healthier place that is safer from both the security and environmental points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an elected Member for the constituency of Dublin South-Central, I must consider this programme from my constituents' viewpoint. Dublin South-Central has areas of the greatest social and economic deprivation in the whole country. The greater part of the constituency comprises areas of hard working, tax paying citizens, who earn around the average industrial wage. There are also areas where there are concentrations of senior citizens and there is a small professional <Col N="680" /> section of the Civil Service in the constituency. All socio-economic groups live in there. I must ask if I can look my constituents in the eye and say this is the programme for Government for which they voted. I must ask if it is clear and deliverable. Since I need to be able to answer those questions in the affirmative, I will consider some of the items in the programme.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this country has an underlying desire for peace in Northern Ireland. The programme states we will introduce an all-Ireland travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of the island. The free travel scheme, initiated by Charles J. Haughey, was one of the best things ever to happen in this country and this proposal would be of great benefit to pensioners.</P>
    <P>It is the stated intention of the Government to have a referendum on the Nice treaty in the autumn and this will be an opportunity for public representatives from Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil to work together to explain the benefits of enlargement and address the concerns that were expressed by people before the last referendum on the treaty. I wish the Taoiseach the best of luck in Seville in seeking a declaration on neutrality.</P>
    <P>The programme states we will implement Dáil reforms to ensure improved scrutiny of EU legislation and developments. We are very lucky to have three eminent and well-qualified members of the convention on Europe in Deputy John Bruton, Proinsias De Rossa representing the European Parliament and Ray MacSharry for the Government. Yesterday I attended the National Forum on Europe and they set out what is happening in the convention including how the national parliaments can become more relevant to European affairs. In that way the European Union would become more democratic and transparent.</P>
    <P>Our intention is to complete the extension of our overseas aid programme and achieve the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on development aid by 2007. That is a target all the people in Ireland and my constituents in Dublin South-Central would accept. Everybody has a great empathy with those who are suffering from wars, AIDS, HIV and famine. There is a duty on those of us who have done well in recent times to help in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a tradition in Dublin South-Central of people joining the Army. I am delighted there have been such major and positive developments within the Army, helped to a great extent by the revenue from property sales, which will be invested in infrastructure and equipment. Members of the Defence Forces are delighted that Irish troops will continue to be available to serve abroad on international peacekeeping missions. It is a great way to train Army personnel and keep up their morale.</P>
    <P>The motion is very much tied into the framework of the budgetary process and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, addressed this last night. I share the Minister's view that we can <Col N="681" /> and should only spend the resources we have. We should not overspend. As the Minister said, we have given a foreign commitment under the EU Stability and Growth Pact to maintain the budget close to in balance or in surplus. This was set out very clearly in our manifesto and was accepted by the electorate.</P>
    <P>The programme states that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have delivered dramatic reductions in taxation over the past five years. That is self-evident and anybody who canvassed at the general election saw that there were new cars and home improvements, people were fitter and better dressed and there is a better quality of life. This came about as a result of people having more money in their pockets.</P>
    <P>Over the next five years the priorities will be to eliminate from the tax net those on the national minimum wage. We will ensure that 80% of all earners only pay tax at the standard rate. Those two items are very important to the constituency of Dublin South-Central where there are people working on wages close to the national minimum wage. As I mentioned earlier, many of my constituents earn around the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>The programme sets out many of our intentions in relation to the very important area of enterprise and employment. Dublin South-Central contains areas like Walkinstown, Crumlin and Drimnagh that have been in existence for about 50 to 60 years. Many people now elderly came into those areas and worked hard. Many of their children went to university, obtained masters and PhD qualifications and are now in the workplace. The Government will encourage multinational and indigenous firms to develop higher productivity and knowledge-based activities, which is the direction we must take. We must develop the types of industries and services where the wages and salaries are higher than they are in the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the old age contributory pension will be increased to &euro;200 per week and &euro;150 is the intended amount for social welfare payments. The original question was whether I can go eye-to-eye with my constituents and say An Agreed Programme for Government is what they voted for and that it is clear and deliverable. I believe I can truthfully say it is.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Coveney, Connaughton, Breen, Murphy, Timmins, Boyle and Connolly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Agreed Programme for Government has 23 commitments to &ldquo;improve the level and quality of participation and achievement at every level of education&rdquo; but only one of these 23 commitments, that is in relation to establishing a national expert service for special needs education, actually has a targeted time frame. The most telling line in An Agreed Programme for Government is that &ldquo;it is a pledge to keep faith with the people and to honour the mandate given by them&rdquo;. Some manifesto promises, but not all, are <Col N="682" /> included, frequently as watered down, untargeted, immeasurable aspirations.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed itself to &ldquo;further expand adult literacy services&rdquo;. One quarter of our adults have the lowest level of literacy. What happened to the provision of training places for over 70,000 people in five years as promised in the Fianna Fáil manifesto? What happened to the Progressive Democrats promises that &ldquo;basic literacy at all levels is the most fundamental national education target&rdquo;? When and how is it intended that this target will be met?</P>
    <P>Every county has school buildings in dire conditions. Some in my constituency were recently described as unfit and unsafe. An Agreed Programme for Government pledges to ensure that every school building attains set modern standards. I would have assumed that the Government would have been aware at this stage of the conditions of school buildings around the country but yet, in order to reach this modern standard, children, their parents and their teachers will have to wait for a national assessment and inventory of conditions, without any timescale for completion. Why has the Government limited the &ldquo;second chance guarantee&rdquo; to those who left school before completing the junior cycle at second level? This excludes the significant portion that completes the junior cycle but fails to complete the senior cycle and leaves school with very limited qualifications. Are these young adults not equally deserving of a second chance? </P>
    <P>The programme contains no commitment to ensuring greater participation in sport, particularly at primary school level. No effort has been made to promote sport among school children so as to create a habit of physical activity at an early age. Indeed, the pledge to work with local authorities to provide facilities such as swimming pools at municipal level threatens to remove the one proper physical education outlet available during school times to children because, as is the case in County Offaly, many swimming pools are not under the control of local authorities and are totally under-funded and in danger of closing.</P>
    <P>Commitments to third level education are equally uninspiring. Continued support for advanced research and physical renewal of campuses is welcome but uncosted. There is no mention of tackling drop-out rates in third level education or of trying to increase participation. There is no commitment to tackling payment rates for third level grants, only an increase in eligibility for families with a number of students attending college at the same time. We still lag far behind the EU average for the provision of on-campus accommodation, forcing students to pay exorbitant rents, with over half of them in part-time work so that they can afford to remain in college.</P>
    <P>There is no commitment to improve the quality and take-up of science subjects at second level, nor is there a commitment to ensure that all schools are in a position to provide the three main science subjects. No motivation or incentive is provided in the programme to encourage <Col N="683" /> students to go down this route and, indeed, the fiasco of last week's biology paper will probably provide a further disincentive to students picking their subjects for next year.</P>
    <P>One glaring omission from the programme is the lack of commitment by the Government to provide outreach facilities from existing third level institutions to areas without these facilities. My county and constituency has one of the poorest take-up rates of third level places in the country. The failure to include such an important commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government leaves very much open to question last night's statement by the Minister for Finance on the Government's commitment to ensuring that all our children can achieve their potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before speaking to the motion, I first congratulate Deputy Michael Ahern on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I was very disappointed that Cork did not get more than one Minister of State but the Minister of State who has been appointed is well deserving of his portfolio and I genuinely wish him well.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion before the House. This is my first time returning to the Dáil after a general election and I had expected a detailed and ambitious programme for Government, with set targets to be achieved and a timescale laid out. I expected, particularly with the influence of the Progressive Democrats, that things would be approached in a businesslike manner. Even the smallest company or business setting up and looking for the trust of a bank requires a detailed business plan with short, medium and long-term projections and targets so that progress can be measured and monitored.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government is little more than a list of aspirations, most of them very worthy, but with no figures, targets or timescale to enable us to measure its performance. This time next year we in the Opposition could still be fed with the same aspirations with no target being met. In the section under the heading &ldquo;Insurance and Road Safety&rdquo;, which affects so many young people, there is an aspiration that &ldquo;work on the penalty points system will be completed to ensure its implementation at an early stage.&rdquo; That same aspiration, in almost exactly the same words, was expressed three and a half years ago, yet the Government still lacks the confidence to promise to deliver that before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My new responsibility is to provide constructive opposition in the portfolio of Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources. The first failing in An Agreed Programme for Government is that it did not even inform us that communications, the marine and natural resources were to be linked in the same Department. In fact, there is no real mention of communications in the document, apart from a <Col N="684" /> brief mention of broadband access with no timescale and no targets. Under research and development, all the difficult challenges that we face in broadcasting are not even referred to in the document, something about which people working in RTE will be very concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise two specific questions in relation to my areas of responsibility. First, why was there a demotion of the marine portfolio? We are an island nation with responsibility for 15% of EU waters, with potential riches in fish and natural resources second to none in Europe. We are facing negotiations on a new Common Fisheries Policy in Europe. Yet, when the Taoiseach announced the Cabinet, there was not even a Minister for the Marine and it was only after intensive lobbying by the marine industry that he changed his mind and re-installed the marine portfolio to the Cabinet table. Second, why is the communications brief linked with the marine and natural resources? There is no real connection. We will have a Department split in half, with one side dealing with communications and broadcasting and all that goes with that, which is substantial, while on the other side the same Department will deal with fisheries, marine and natural resources. This is in a year which may be the most important in decades for Irish fisheries. I do not see the logic or the connection in that regard, but it is clear that there has been a serious downgrading of the marine as a priority area for this Government.</P>
    <P>On looking at An Agreed Programme for Government in relation to my areas of responsibility, I found no reference whatsoever to the communications portfolio and there is a half page on the marine and natural resources. Some of the sections on fisheries are encouraging and relevant but there is no reference to the National Maritime College which is being established for the first time, nothing on sail training and the word &ldquo;safety&rdquo; is not even mentioned in the document in relation to the sea, although people die every year &ndash; needlessly, in my view &ndash; because of lack of Government policy in this area. There is still a great deal of work to do in relation to the marine and natural resources and, indeed, communications. I hope the Government gives it greater priority than is highlighted in this document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on An Agreed Programme for Government set out between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Essentially, this will be the Bible by which this country will live and prosper, or otherwise, over the next five years.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Tom Parlon on his elevation as Minister of State at the Department of Finance and I wish him the very best over the next five years. I have no doubt the challenges which confronted the Government in the last five years will be much more difficult in the next five years, but I hope for all our sakes they are met successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment to the Fine Gael front bench as spokesman on regional development, I <Col N="685" /> have taken particular notice of the programme for Government and what it says in that area. As the document reveals, the core objective of the national development plan is the achievement of a balanced regional development. The number one item under that heading states that the Government will complete and implement the national spatial strategy which is aimed at ensuring all the regions develop to their potential. If I had not been around this House for a while, and had not listened to a lot of things over the past five years, I might actually get excited about that development.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Government dodged and failed to bell the cat in the last five years so far as spatial development is concerned. The Government has no proposals for any counterbalance to the unhealthy example of growth that is Dublin. In a country of 4 million inhabitants, that 1.5 million people live in one area does not make sense and shows that we are the most centralised economy in Europe, if not the world.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a re-think on the way the economy is dispersed. It is very important that Dublin is strong, and everyone accepts that, but there are many things Government policies can do to ensure that the thousands who do not want to commute to and from the city every day, and do not want to clog up the thoroughfares of the city, do not have to do so, and that those who want to live and work in their localities can do so. This can only be done with a proper, well researched spatial strategy that ensures we have areas of growth big enough to pull away from the terrible attraction that is Dublin.</P>
    <P>Since I came to the Dáil, no Government has been able to pinpoint why everything is happening in Dublin and why it cannot happen elsewhere. Unfortunately, we have now reached the stage where, unless we are prepared to take the bull by the horns and provide areas with infrastructure on a scale that is strong enough to overcome that draw towards Dublin, we will make a hames out of this country. We are far down that road.</P>
    <P>I hope I am wrong but, from what I hear and see from economists, engineers and project evaluators across the country, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 cannot be delivered in the manner we have been told it will be. I hope that it can be done but I am told that there has been a 25% cost increase. Some of the roads that we are told are so necessary might not be ready for another ten or 15 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen" hpid="Mr. P. Breen Mr. P. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the chance to speak in this debate. Fine Gael has been calling for some time for a dedicated Minister for Transport and I welcome the chance to engage with the new Minister. It is unfortunate that it has taken five years for this Government to see how bad the transport situation is. The programme for Government has done nothing to improve this. It is nothing but a wish list, lacks direction and is drawn up by a Government that is unable to <Col N="686" /> implement most of it and is unwilling to recognise the problems the country faces.</P>
      <P>The Government states that it will support an agreed survival plan for Aer Lingus in its programme for Government. Nobody on the Opposition benches wants Aer Lingus to fail; it is the Government that has undermined the State airline at every turn. When the rainbow Government was in place, the national carrier was in extremely good health. The Government is not serious about sharing the benefits of the Celtic tiger it inherited five years ago. It is vital that international airports such as Cork and Shannon are developed to their full potential. Proper leadership is needed with regard to restructuring Aer Lingus. There is a situation at Shannon Airport where the only direct flight to New York, the EI 111, is now to start in Dublin before travelling to Shannon and on to New York. This means that cabin crews are to be based in Dublin. There are at present 254 cabin crew based in Shannon and some of these jobs will be transferred to Dublin. Is that progress in the airline business?</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is totally committed to Aer Lingus and its staff but this support need not be to the exclusion of communities far removed from the population centres that have done well from the recent boom. Fine Gael believes in protecting the needs of the entire nation and the Government must join with us in ensuring a vibrant rural economy, a strong national airline and modern transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government says that the Government will ensure a low-cost facility is built at pier D in Dublin Airport without delay. However, it does not mention other airports such as Shannon Airport. A terminal was built at Shannon in 1998 costing &euro;30 million that can handle up to 5.5 million passengers per year. At the moment it is handling 2.2 million passengers and is totally under-used. That is what the Government is doing towards regionalisation. I have mentioned what the Government has done in relation to the low cost airlines.</P>
      <P>When passengers are out of the sky and on the ground, things get no better. The programme suggests that the Government will fully implement the national roads programme in the national development plan. There is no mention of the economic mess that the plan is in or of the 33 road projects currently on hold, among them the Ennis bypass which has been on hold since last October. One of the largest volumes of traffic in Ireland &ndash; about 22,000 cars &ndash; passes through Ennis town every day. There is no mention of the delays, the mismanagement and the lack of consultation by this Government in its mishandling of the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the problem of the railways. In the programme for Government, there are promises on Luas but no promises on the railways in the western part of the country. The Limerick-Sligo line is in total chaos. The Government won last month's election on the back of a good economy behind which it could hide its lack of pro<Col N="687" /> gress on countless social and economic fronts. It will have nowhere to hide in the months ahead. The programme for Government is a sham. For Irish passengers and commuters it is progress delayed. It will take the next programme for Government to get Ireland moving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government clearly says that the Government will support the positive role of community employment schemes to meet the needs of both the long-term unemployed and the community. The Government has made a great start to this by cutting 7,000 places. I have listened to the Minister's explanation as to how she will put jobs currently with FÁS into health and education. She calls it &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo; these jobs. This is not such a bad idea provided the Department of Finance is going to properly finance these departments. Unfortunately, the experience is that the health boards will always be short of money. Consequently, these services will suffer.</P>
      <P>The big problem that has not been mentioned is how the Minister is to mainstream or finance environmental projects. The town and village renewal schemes carried out in co-operation with local authorities were a great success, and the development of leisure facilities in towns and villages was equally successful. However, the cutbacks in FÁS schemes puts these projects in jeopardy. The natural way to mainstream these jobs, if one was to follow the Minister's line, would be through the local councils. However, this Government introduced the policy document, Better Local Government, without financially compensating the councils. Most councils are now completely broke and have not the financial resources to mainstream these tasks. This is a major crisis for local communities and the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs must come up with a scheme to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Despite the decrease in unemployment figures to which the Tánaiste constantly referred today, there is still room for a social employment scheme. There are still people who are at a disadvantage or are too old to go into mainstream employment, who want the dignity of having a job and to be able to continue to serve their communities. A solution is possible if the Government has the will to solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government continues: &ldquo;We will move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government Offices and Agencies taking into account the National Spatial Strategy.&rdquo;  This is extremely good news for the people of north Cork who were told prior to and during the election that a decision to decentralise to Duhallow and the Charleville area would be taken, but not officially announced during the election in case it would be regarded as a cynical exercise. As the election is now over, this promise will definitely be regarded as a cynical exercise if the <Col N="688" /> Government does not deliver. This area of north Cork meets all the requirements, we were told. Now we await the announcement. As an area which has been seriously disadvantaged during the past five years by the policies of the last Government, particularly because of its neglect of agriculture, it is time it was thrown a lifeline.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government frequently refers to justice and the prevention of crime. While it is all very praiseworthy, it is of little use to a community like Newmarket which will no longer have a Garda barracks because it has been condemned. Despite our best efforts and those of the GRA, no funding has been made available. The grandiose talk is of little use to villages scattered throughout Cork and the rest of the country which no longer have a Garda presence. Words, plans and programmes or even well-intentioned waffle will not provide these services, action is what is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Parlon on his appointment to the Office of Public Works, an ironic position for him. Having read the programme for Government, I understand why he decided to take his chances in the floodwaters of Ringsend rather than face the agricultural community, particularly in counties Laois and Offaly. Given that there is very little in the document on agriculture, he has made a wise choice.</P>
      <P>It is often said that the Taoiseach speaks in forked tongues and operates in strange ways. I have a grave suspicion about the programme for Government. Although I belong to the group which believes that self-preservation is best served by not being overly critical, the Tánaiste and Taoiseach have handed us a time bomb because the document contains a huge amount of material with which it is possible to find fault with the Government. As I do not wish to be overly negative, I will confine my remarks to the section on agriculture, food and rural development which contains 20 points, five of which I have chosen at random.</P>
      <P>The first is the undertaking to &ldquo;maintain the Government and diplomatic offensive to improve world access and the opening of markets&rdquo;. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, knows how successful the last Government was in that area. The document continues: &ldquo;We will broaden the scope of agricultural education.&rdquo; In the past few years five of the 11 agricultural colleges have been closed. It further undertakes to &ldquo;encourage the Irish beef industry&rdquo;. This, it states, will be &ldquo;underpinned by the National Beef Assurance Scheme&rdquo;. The relevant legislation was passed in 1998, yet four years later it has not been implemented.</P>
      <P>The Government also promises to</P>
      <P>foster a clean and attractive countryside with a high quality of life that can be enjoyed and appreciated by all. As part of this policy we will seek to make the REP scheme more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the REP scheme has come into operation, the number of regulations has increased. Accord<Col N="689" /> ingly, inputs have increased while funding, in the form of the grant for the scheme, has not changed. This hardly amounts to encouragement.</P>
    <P>My final point refers to the promise to &ldquo;agree a series of proposals with farming organisations designed to tackle red-tape&rdquo;. I heard some Government members mention that an appeals office has been set up, yet to the best of my knowledge it has not heard a single appeal. I have covered just five of the 25 points in this section and will not elaborate further on them because my own preservation would not be best served by doing so.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few points about the agriculture and food sector. Many people in the industry have been experiencing difficulties as a result of the inclement weather.</P>

      <P>The Minister's predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who also had responsibility for flooding, gave a loose commitment to provide funding for flood prevention works in Arklow. Funding was provided for a study which is due to be published shortly and I look forward to the allocation of funding for the proposals it will contain.

      <P>This programme for Government is a modest little document from a Government that has decided it has much to be modest about. The motion on Private Members' time on the failure to adequately cost the provisions of the document is self-evident and the Green Party is happy to support it. With half the Government benches filled by members of the Progressive Democrats, I am pleased the party has at last achieved equal partner status.</P>
      <P>The Opposition will challenge the mythology, which the Government appears willing to perpetuate, that somehow one can collect less taxes while spending more money by magicking the money from other sources, such as public private finance initiatives. The external factors which helped the roller coaster ride that was the economy during the past decade no longer exist. It is not so much that the bubble has burst, but that it has vaporised. The Government will have to reap what it has sown in raising expectations and failing to deliver for the vast majority of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it should not get carried away with <Col N="690" /> the idea that it has received some kind of mandate to carry out this programme. Although it received an electoral bonus in terms of seats, the people gave the parties on this side of the House about 55% of the vote. Therefore, we have as much right to claim we represent the interests of the people as the Government. We are prepared to offer the type of challenge to the sterile and ultimately damaging philosophies it seeks to impose on the people for another five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I earnestly ask that the Government take account of the very serious situation at Monaghan General Hospital. The position is that we will not have medical personnel in place, nor have any such vacancies been advertised, to ensure that accident and emergency services will continue to be provided after 1 July, that is, in ten days' time. I am extremely conscious of the very significant mandate given to me by the people to ensure there will be a hospital available to the people of County Monaghan which will deliver basic services, including accident and emergency services.</P>
      <P>Monaghan General Hospital has a proud record of service provision and expert care and innumerable lives have been saved due to the professionalism and expertise of its staff. However, the tendency recently has been to denude the hospital of its basic services, thereby forcing patients to bypass it to receive treatment in Drogheda, Navan or Dublin. In cases of major trauma, this places lives at unnecessary risk and, given the hospital's proud record, it is unforgivable.</P>
      <P>Best medical practice indicates that the first hour, the golden hour, after a major accident is most critical and often determines whether a patient will live or die. A two or three hour delay is totally illogical when the previously adopted policy of the North-Eastern Health Board requires that a fully resourced and staffed accident and emergency department be based at Monaghan General Hospital. Here, a patient's condition could be immediately stabilised prior to a decision being taken on possible transfer elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In view of its unique geographic location in the Border area, Monaghan General Hospital is in a position to extend its services to its natural hinterland which straddles the Border and embraces south Tyrone and Armagh. The CAWT initiative with the North-Eastern Health Board presents us with an exciting and imaginative vista which envisages services being provided on a cross-Border basis. The people of County Monaghan have a right to convenient access to the highest standards of health care in a rural setting. Population rather than economics should be the sole arbiter of this. On behalf of the people of County Monaghan, I commend to the Government the urgent requirement and basic need for a fully staffed, fully equipped and properly funded general hospital in Monaghan with proper accident and emergency facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be here this evening to speak on the motion. The previous Government's record over the past five years provides a firm basis on which further progress, as set out in the new programme for Government, will be achieved. The new programme for Government is specific and targeted. It sets out key priorities for action aimed at building on the successes of the previous Government over the past five years. The Government programme clearly sets out its priorities with regard to improving the quality and effectiveness of public services and delivering on major capital programmes.</P>
      <P>The level of investment in the health service since 1997 has been significant and is now at the EU average. The new programme for Government re-emphasises the Government's commitment to implementing the key aspects of the health strategy.</P>
      <P>The Government has already shown its commitment to those on low incomes. In the period 1997-2002 social welfare spending increased by over 60% to just over &euro;9 billion this year. The proportion of our population experiencing consistent poverty, as targeted by the national anti-poverty strategy, has fallen dramatically and there have been substantial reductions in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. The new programme commits the Government to reducing this even further.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years the Government made education a top priority. This was underpinned by an unprecedented level of funding. In our new programme for Government we will continue to implement policies which will ensure all our children can achieve their potential. These policies will have particular regard to children with special needs and children and adults from disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current programme for Government undertakes to &ldquo;address Ireland's infrastructural deficit in a coherent and determined way over the next five years&rdquo;. It states, &ldquo;New methods of financing major capital programmes are required which must take account of the need to maximise efficiency, delivery, value for money and appropriate risk transfer across multi-annual programmes.&rdquo; In order to achieve this the Government proposes to establish, under the auspices of the NTMA, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, to finance major public projects and evaluate financing options for public-private partnership, PPP, projects. The NDFA will enable the Government to apply commercial standards in evaluating financial risks, costs and options associated with projects. As a result it will ensure the best financial package is availed of in each instance. The NDFA may compete with, but will not substitute for, private financing of PPP projects. It will work as an additional mechanism to be used to achieve value for money and risk transfer in PPP projects. Where significant once-off revenues accrue to the State through the sale of State assets or the restructuring of the Central <Col N="692" /> Bank, we will use these revenues to create a national transformation fund. This fund will also be managed by the NTMA and used to finance multi-annual infrastructural projects. Work on the establishment of the NDFA is already under way. Primary legislation will be required. The Minister for Finance expects to be in a position shortly to seek Government approval to prepare it. It is hoped to have the agency operational by 1 January 2003.</P>
    <P>Our economic prospects remain favourable, provided we continue to pursue the correct policies and secure our competitiveness. This Government's policies offer the best prospect of meeting the challenges which face us. I am in no doubt that the economy is in a healthy state and well positioned to take advantage of the improvement in the international economy as the year progresses in order that we can return to our potential GDP growth level of around 5% from 2003 onwards, but this is not to say we can take success for granted. As a small open economy, it is very important that the economy remains competitive, particularly as we no longer have domestic control of exchange and interest rate policy. That is the reason social partnership has been so important to our economic success. We must ensure costs evolve in line with productivity. It is crucial that an inflationary mentality does not take hold. Social partnership is key in this context.</P>
    <P>The previous Government achieved much in the past five years. The record speaks for itself. Our new programme for Government is specific and targeted and will result in even more success and prosperity over the next five years for the economy and the country as a whole. I urge the House to support the amended motion.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, on his appointment. Farmers in counties Laois and Offaly must be very disappointed he did not take the agriculture portfolio. I also congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Browne, on his appointment as a Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's agenda for the future is very disappointing. My expectations have been sadly dashed. When the programme for Government was being prepared I thought there would be something very exciting in it, but we are back to the same old programme of planning for the future. I thought the Government would have learned something from being in government for the past five years. All kinds of promises were made before the general election about what would be done if it got back into power, but looking through the programme the calculator used to add up the figures was not functioning properly. Two phrases resound through the document &ndash;&ldquo;we believe&rdquo; and &ldquo;we are committed&rdquo;. I hope <Col N="693" /> the commitment and belief expressed are carried through in the future.</P>
    <P>The development of a world class health service is one of the core objectives and I am eager to see its implementation. According to the Fianna Fáil manifesto the waiting lists were to have been eliminated in two years, but there is no reference to such a period in the programme for Government. What has happened to this aspiration? Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, can explain this, or the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, when he next comes into the House. It appears that it will be only a matter of days before people will get the treatment they need in regard to hip replacements, heart surgery and cataract operations. With my colleagues on the Opposition benches, I will be keeping a close eye on how the Government handles the issue of health care.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Health and Children will be able to visit my home county of Wexford in the sunny south east because he has not yet been there. I would like to bring him to St. John's Geriatric Hospital where a new hospital has been promised on three occasions, yet not even a spade has been stuck in the ground. Perhaps the Taoiseach or Tánaiste or anyone else will come down to turn the first sod. The people of County Wexford raised £250,000 for a CAT scan machine to be in operation from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., five days a week. In May 2001 I got a guarantee from the Minister for Health and Children that the machine would be operated to its full capacity, but the situation has not yet improved. I look forward to a resolution of such matters in the near future.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government states:</P>
    <P>We are committed to helping to improve the level and quality of participation and achievement at every level of education . . . We will ensure that every school building attains set modern standards.</P>
    <P>We could bring the Government to County Wexford or anywhere else in the country to see the poor state of our schools. Since I became involved in political life, an inordinate number of people have come to me on behalf of schools waiting for more teachers, including remedial, extensions and so on.</P>
    <P>The proposal to help carers is long overdue. It is about time that recognition was given to the hard work done in regard to the care of the elderly and those with disabilities. I hope the Government will give such people the recognition they deserve.</P>
    <P>There is much work to be done over the next five years, but the programme for Government does not inspire confidence that enough will be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little faith in the document, which begins with talk of the opportunity to build a fairer society of equal opportunity and sustainable prosperity. I know the Tánaiste thinks this Government has been in existence for only two weeks, but Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been in Government for the past five years. Why do they want to plan only now for a fairer society? Did the past five years not present the opportunity to do so? They have hardly realised that an opportunity exists only now.</P>
      <P>There are many examples of unfairness across the country and in my county of Meath. The programme will not alleviate the many problems that exist. One example concerns motor insurance and young people. I pay over &euro;2,500 for insurance and I have worked with lads who pay &euro;4,500. I do not believe this plan will solve the crisis. Under the heading &ldquo;Insurance and Road Safety&rdquo;, I read about the aspiration to make the insurance market more consumer-friendly. Does this mean that the person taking my cheque for &euro;2,500 will smile at me?</P>
      <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Railways&rdquo;, I read that a blueprint and study are on the way. This does not excite me. It does not do much for the 6,000 or 7,000 commuters leaving my home town of Navan every morning to travel for two and a half hours to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have little faith in this programme because of its lack of measurable goals. An Agreed Programme for Government states: &ldquo;This Programme for Government is both clear in intent and specific in detail.&rdquo; This is another joke. The programme is the opposite; it is of doubtful content and far from specific in detail. A prime example of this is in the first couple of pages of the foreword, which states that the Government pledges to transform the country it found in 1997. Into what will it be transformed? This is not very <Col N="695" /> clear or specific. If we are to go on the past five years, I fear into what the country will be transformed.</P>
    <P>I fear potential headlines in 2006 and 2007 will be as follows: &ldquo;Infrastructure projects being bypassed instead of the towns&rdquo;; &ldquo;All State assets sold to pay off national debts&rdquo;; &ldquo;Spiralling inflation leaves tourists as rare as leprechauns&rdquo;; &ldquo;National toll roads to introduce car-parking charges on the clogged up M50&rdquo;; &ldquo;Business parks left idle as multinationals flee the country&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Farm tours being organised for farmers who have no farms of their own.&rdquo; The only bypass my town of Navan will receive is a jobs bypass.</P>

      <P>I am not a pessimist by nature and it does not do me any good to speak like this, but let us be fair. If we compare what the Government of 1997 promised to the promises of this Government, there is little difference. Talk is cheap. Paper never refuses ink.</P>
      <P>It is not too late to set real goals and agendas and to stop shooting for the stars. There is no way anybody will get everything right, but there are valuable lessons to be learnt from the last programme for Government. Sadly, we have not done so.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will admit that he did not get everything right, but I will not hold that against him. He produced a document with no stated, achievable goals, with nothing to fall back on when things go wrong or no real cast-iron guarantees to our young, old, healthy or sick. In light of this, will the Government rework its programme? When it does so I will be the first to congratulate it. We want a programme that shows real accountability. Let the people see that we in Dáil Éireann want to make a difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is revealing that the programme for Government, in addressing the issue of economic growth, states that it sees &ldquo;low inflation, responsible fiscal policies and effective investment policies&rdquo; as central to this. It is revealing because, on all those fronts, the Government has been a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example is low price inflation. Price inflation is currently running at double the EU average. IBEC and the Minister's spouse in IBEC are telling the Government that inflation rates are increasing at an alarming rate and that it is becoming embedded in our economy. We have already seen that we are experiencing difficulties <Col N="696" /> in critical markets. Inflation is not something to be smirked at. It is not something vague like the CSO records. We are talking about real jobs. Already, we are seeing a decline in manufacturing employment. In the past 12 months, manufacturing is down 1%. Tourism is following suit. We are seeing real signs of struggle on the competitiveness front. The Government that tells us low inflation is a key issue in the programme for Government is misguided. It does not mention low inflation again in the programme. The first and last thing it has to say about inflation is in that sentence. It is not surprising since the Government's record is so poor.</P>
    <P>The Government also says that responsible fiscal policies are crucial to growth. This is the Government which, last year, allowed spending to grow at three times the level of growth of revenue. This year it has trumped that. In the first five months, spending has grown by 27%, double its own estimate. Furthermore, taxation revenue was down in the first five months. The Government says that its record will stand or fall on fiscal rectitude and a responsible approach to public finances.</P>
    <P>Where were our Progressive Democrats colleagues when decisions on public spending were being taken? Where were they when, in the first five months, agricultural spending was up 73% on this time last year? Department of the Environment and Local Government spending is up 46% on this time last year while Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation spending is up 54% on this time last year. Health spending is up by 29%. The so-called big spender of health is trailing behind these other Departments.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle knows the Government concealed the incipient deficit in its spending in the budget earlier this year by raiding, to the tune of &euro;2 billion, various funds in the Central Bank and of PAYE workers who put their money into social insurance. The <Col N="697" /> Government has brought forward corporation tax to try clothe its nakedness.</P>
      <P>In terms of health, the Government is proposing to spend &euro;7 billion extra over the coming five years. That is to what the Department of Health and Children says the national strategy amounts. What has the Government done? It said that it is committed to the national strategy, but it will not provide a budget framework. It will not do so in spite of having lectured the Opposition on its failure to provide a budget framework during the recent election campaign. It has the resources of the Department of Finance at its disposal, but the Minister did not even ask his officials in the Department of Finance to cost this programme. The Government is flying by the seat of its pants.</P>
      <P>We have got used to this practice. The Minister can, without a blush, say &ldquo;We do not bother to cost our programmes. We may implement them when the time comes. These were things over which we went to the country and made solemn pledges to the electorate, but they do not matter now. We will just have to wait and see what turns up next.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance told us how investment was so important to this Government. The Government has had huge cost overruns in project after project to which it was committed. Despite that, not one re-evaluation of any of those programmes was undertaken. The Minister tells us he is interested in efficient spending. Instead, all he produces is <Col N="698" /> institutional claptrap about three or four new agencies that will be set up to produce and manage funds. He does not look at whether we are achieving anything for this spending.</P>
    <P>Regarding health, the Minister for Finance admits that, having doubled spending on the health service, he still cannot see any improvement in accident and emergency departments, improvements for carers caring in the home or speech therapy services for children who have been waiting four years for them.</P>
    <P>Why has the Government not committed itself in this programme to evaluating the reason it is getting public spending so wrong? It is being allowed to rise inexorably. More and more is spent, yet poorer and poorer services are being delivered. These are the issues we expect to see addressed in a serious programme for Government. Priorities and ideas for reform should be set out. Where is the reform in the antiquated education structures, health boards and transport infrastructure? There is no reform in this programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Éamon Ó Cuív: It was a success though.</P>
    <P>Mr. R. Bruton: It lacks vision and is about as exciting as a reheated lunch. That is what it is, the old manifesto of 1997 reheated and put out again. A big bulldog clip of pious hopes pulls it all together.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Declaration on Neutrality.</Title>
    <P>Mr. Sargent: Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Aengus Ó Snodaigh.</P>
    <P>The matter of the forthcoming Seville Summit should have been raised at Taoiseach's Question Time today as I had tabled six questions. However, they were withdrawn without my permission and I am left to address the Dáil at the end of business. Meanwhile, the Taoiseach dodges and weaves around EU capitals like a hapless Neville Chamberlain, waving a declaration on neutrality which has not come before the Dáil. In the name of the people, I demand to see the wording of this declaration. After all, we know that it will make no difference to the Government's future behaviour in relation to the ongoing militarisation of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Ireland's involvement in the EU Rapid Reaction Force, which was never approved by the people, was cited by many &ldquo;No&rdquo; voters as the reason they rejected the Nice treaty, yet when the Taoiseach comes back from Seville the Government will still be involved in the Rapid Reaction Force. The Government, through the Rapid Reaction Force, will still have no problem with forming what Prime Minister Blair has stated is a strategic partnership with NATO, a military alliance based on nuclear weapons. The Government will still have no problem with the fact that some Rapid Reaction Force operations will be planned at NATO's supreme headquarters in Europe and under NATO command, nor will it see any problem with allowing US troops and military aircraft to use Shannon Airport en route to a war zone such as Afghanistan, or with <Col N="701" /> allowing the US Airforce to conduct military training exercises out of Shannon Airport and across the Irish countryside, as it did earlier this month. Already, NATO and US Congressional reports are referring to us as &ldquo;former neutrals&rdquo; in the European Union. The Government could have sought a protocol, similar to the one included by Denmark in the Amsterdam treaty. Such a protocol would have been legally binding. A declaration is meaningless. This declaration will fool no one, least of all Irish voters.</P>
    <P>There are other vital decisions being taken at Seville, particularly in terms of immigration policy. We have had no accountability before the Dáil on these issues either. The Government wonders why the people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Nice treaty the first time, yet we know that the lack of democratic accountability was a major issue. The lack of accountability of EU institutions and the Government to Irish citizens is still obviously alive and well in this new Administration. The Government's arrogant behaviour is a major reason the majority of the people will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; again to the Nice treaty.</P>
    <P>Aengus Ó Snodaigh: Ceann de na ceachtanna a múinimid do páistí óga ná nuair a deirtear &ldquo;No&rdquo;, is &ldquo;No&rdquo; atá i gceist. Is trua nach dtuigeann an Rialtas an ceacht seo. Ní hé sin an t-aon masla ar an daonlathas atá déanta ag an Rialtas. Masla eile ná go bhfuil an Taoiseach ag dul timpeall na hEorpa ag lorg tacaíocht ó tíortha eile do doiciméad nach bhfaca muidne atá togha ag an phobal. The declaration will come before this House next week. By the look of things, everybody else in Europe will have seen it, everybody except those on the Opposition benches in this House.</P>
    <P>This was the only state to hold a referendum on the Nice treaty, the only state to consult the people and by the look if it, the only state to reject the people's view. If they had not rejected the wishes of the people, we would not be time-wasting in this House next week, nor would we be wasting time for two weeks in September, or by holding another referendum in October. If the Government was serious about neutrality, why did it not adopt Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin's Bill on neutrality, as put before this House? It was proposed at the time as the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Had the Government adopted this Bill we could have a proper referendum on neutrality in October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify to the House the Government's approach to the declarations we are seeking at Seville &ndash; the national declaration by Ireland and the related declaration by the European Council. I emphasise that the texts of the declarations fully reflect the views expressed in the second report of the chairman of the National Forum on Europe. The forum was established as part of the Government's response to the concerns of the people raised in last summer's referendum on the Nice treaty. Chairman <Col N="702" /> Hayes, in his second report, underlined the importance of assurances that the Nice treaty did not imply a departure from our traditional policy of neutrality&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Boyle: On a point of order, that is not true. The Minister should not mislead the House.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cowen: As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, Chairman Maurice Hayes stated we had no plans to enter a military alliance or participate in the development of a European army and would not do so without the approval of the Irish people&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Boyle: That is not true.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: I am reluctant to ask the Deputy to leave the House. However, there are very strict procedures which must be observed for this debate.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cowen: There is no plan to change the basis on which Irish troops participate in peacekeeping and conflict operations. Each and every one of these points is being dealt with by the declarations.</P>
    <P>The national declaration will reaffirm, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the Treaty of Nice poses no threat to our traditional policy of military neutrality. In so doing it will confirm that Ireland is not party to any mutual defence commitment and that we are not party to any plans to develop a European army. It will also reaffirm that we will take our own sovereign decision on whether Irish troops should participate in humanitarian or crisis management tasks mounted by the European Union, based on the triple lock of UN endorsement, Government decision and Dáil approval. Moreover, the national declaration will also make it clear that Ireland will not adopt any decision taken by the European Council to move to a common defence or ratify any future treaty which would involve a departure from our traditional policy of military neutrality unless it has first been approved by the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>In the European Council declaration we will be asking our partners to confirm that the understandings in the national declaration are shared by all 15 EU member states. This includes Sweden, Finland and Austria, which are every bit as attached to their policy of non-alignment or military neutrality as we are. The declarations have a formal status and authority. Should people decide that the State may ratify the Nice treaty our national declaration will be lodged with our instrument of ratification.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asks the reason the wording is not being placed before the Dáil prior to the summit. The Taoiseach and I have been as transparent as possible on the Government's approach to the declarations. However, there has been a need for discussion with our EU partners. As well as con<Col N="703" /> sultations with the Spanish Presidency, the Taoiseach discussed the matter with the Prime Ministers of Finland and Sweden last week and today he is having talks in Rome and Vienna with the Prime Minister of Italy and the Chancellor of Austria. For obvious reasons it has not been possible to reveal the texts of the declarations until negotiations on them have been concluded with our EU partners in Seville.</P>
    <P>The declarations are being adopted on the authority of the Government which is responsible under the Constitution for the exercise of the executive power of the State in the field of foreign relations. Next Tuesday there will be a full discussion in the House on the outcome of the European Council being held in Seville. I can confirm that, when the declarations are agreed and adopted by the European Council, what will be waved to those who oppose the Treaty of Nice will be the legal texts that form the basis upon which successive Governments have preserved and maintained our policy of military neutrality. The clarity of the declarations will expose, for once and for all, the dishonesty of those who continue to seek to tell the people that they have a different meaning. That is what will be waved back&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Higgins: That is not true.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cowen: I will not be shouted down.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Higgins: The Minister will not be shouted down, but he will be answered.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cowen: What will be waved back will be the legal texts of the successive treaties, from the Single European Act to the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties, all of which were adopted. The Nice treaty is yet to be ratified.</P>
    <P>The reason we will have a second referendum is that a central policy platform of the Government prior to the general election was that, if re-elected, we would have a referendum. We have obtained that increased democratic mandate &ndash; that legitimacy is there for all to see and the people will retain the unfettered right to decide what they want to do. It is the duty of any responsible Government where its international interests are involved to put that question and to ask the people to reflect on it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Cowen: I assure Deputy Boyle that what will be waved back at him will be the confirmed and unanimous interpretation of all who negotiated the treaties &ndash; the full interpretation, understanding and political commitment of all member states as to what precisely are our obligations and what are the safeguards that have been negotiated by successive Governments in maintaining our policy of neutrality. That will be <Col N="704" /> something with which those opposite will have to deal when we return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important issue on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply. I wish to put on record details of the financial plight of the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association which is in dire need of greater support from the State.</P>
      <P>The association was formed in 1985 by the families and friends of those suffering from motor neurone disease. Motor neurone disease is a horrendous condition which affects motor neurones and leads to the wasting of muscles over a period of time, causing incapacity and frequently loss of speech and mobility. There are approximately 210 patients in this country. I know people in my constituency who are suffering and others who have died as a result of motor neurone disease and I can testify to the truly horrific nature of this condition.</P>
      <P>As well as supporting research into motor neurone disease, the association provides outstanding support and assistance to patients and their families. This work involves visits to homes, the provision of much needed equipment for patients and the provision of financial support for home nursing. I am also aware that patients and their families have gained tremendously from the wonderful physical and financial support which this association provides.</P>
      <P>Despite the wonderful work carried out by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, the level of Government support is pitiful. In the last calendar year, the association had an income of approximately £468,000 and expenditure of £612,000, leaving it with a deficit of over £144,000. An average of five staff were employed in 2001 and the wage and pension costs amounted to £160,000, although there was some Government help towards salaries and the association is very grateful for this financial support. However, there was no other remuneration from central government.</P>
      <P>An application was made for lottery funding in 2001 but this application was turned down. It has applied for lottery funding for the current year and I urge the Government to consider this application carefully as a matter of priority. Unfortunately, the association also suffered as a result of RTE dropping the People in Need programme, which had meant a considerable amount of money to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Motor Neurone Disease Association faces a particularly acute situation at present with regard to the equipment it provides to patients. Essential equipment, such as chairs, beds, showers and washing equipment, are provided speedily to patients and are always re-used where appropriate. In 2001, the association spent a total of <Col N="705" /> £94,000 on equipment for patients and at present it has over 1,000 pieces of equipment in use.</P>
    <P>The board of directors of the association considers that the financial pressure it is currently under is putting the future of funding and the availability of vital equipment in jeopardy. Why has the Motor Neurone Disease Association been left out of the loop for funding by the Government on so many occasions? Why, when millions of pounds of lottery funding was pumped into every club and organisation around the country, however well merited, was an association which provides such tremendous support to hundreds of people turned down? Why is there no direct aid from the Government, apart from a contribution towards the salaries, to help a body which has to resort to voluntary fund-raising and street collections? I know the nature of the work the association carries out and no such organisation should have to be persistently distracted from its wonderful objectives of patient care by financial headaches. I urge the Minister to consider carefully what I have said and to act speedily to address the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for raising the issue on the Adjournment. I wish to clarify the situation in relation to the provision of funding for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association. I am willing and available to meet the association if it wants to discuss these issues and its needs and assessments with me. There are systems and so on in place through which we allocate funding to health boards to allocate to various organisations dealing with specific diseases or medical conditions. We have assisted a number of them over the last number of years and greatly exceeded their funding base. I have no difficulty meeting the association to try to advance its situation in a better way.</P>
      <P>Generally, the provision of health related services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including motor neurone disease, is a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Priorities for the development of services are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. The Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association is represented by the Disability Federation of Ireland on the regional co-ordinating committees. Since 1997, funding of over &euro;185 million has been provided by the Government for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including people with motor neurone disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional revenue funding of &euro;30.53 million has been allocated in 2002 for investment in services for people with physical and sensory disability, including &euro;6.4 million in resourcing for the voluntary sector. Included in this was the payment of &euro;48,000 to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association through the ERHA as part of <Col N="706" /> the service audit of the voluntary sector physical and sensory service providers.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, limited funding is available through the national lottery for certain once off projects in the voluntary sector. We invite applications for this funding and the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association has applied on a number of occasions over the past few years. Some £80,000 was provided to the association in December 2000 on foot of such an application. Unfortunately, its application was not successful in 2001 as demand exceeded supply. It has, however, applied in 2002 and a decision on this has not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>In addition to this funding, with regard to the overall provision of services, my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector service providers, is currently developing a national physical and sensory disability database which I launched in March of this year. When complete, the database will provide, at local level, a detailed picture of each individual's health service requirements over a five year period and, at national level, detailed statistical information to assist in the acquisition of funds and identify priority services at which to target these resources. The disability database, ultimately, will be the route to a very comprehensive assessment of what is required on the physical and sensory disability side. That database will be the essential tool in the delivery of effective services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, including people with motor neurone disease, in a planned and co-ordinated manner.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Martin, on his re-appointment and welcome back Deputy Pat &ldquo;The Cope&rdquo; Gallagher and congratulate him on becoming a Minister of State.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of the report of the subgroup of the National Cancer Forum, the Southern Health Board is to develop two individual symptomatic breast disease centres of excellence at the South Infirmary and Cork University Hospital. There is widespread concern in Kerry about this decision, especially among women and GPs throughout the county. Women want a service as close to their homes as possible. At the moment, if a lump is detected by a GP on a Friday, the individual involved will be seen in the clinic in Tralee on the Monday morning. There is a very quick reaction time and women feel confident that if a lump is detected, it will be seen to immediately. However, if the service is not provided in Tralee General Hospital, it will mean women having to make appointments in Cork, which can sometimes take weeks. In view of this and given experiences of other areas of surgery, there is genuine concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five weekly clinics for breast care at Tralee General Hospital, including on Monday <Col N="707" /> mornings, which is very important. Recently, more than 300 people picketed the main meeting of the Southern Health Board at the county council offices in Tralee. They expressed their concern about any diminution by the board of the breast cancer services at Tralee hospital. During their protest and at a subsequent meeting, those involved made it clear that they want the services upgraded and improved and not reduced.</P>
    <P>At present, Tralee General Hospital provides all the mammography, biopsy, chemotherapy and consultant services. The breast clinic at the hospital is on a par with the type of centre of excellence proposed for the two hospitals in Cork. In addition, patients can get same day results, immediate diagnosis, and they can be assured that they have nothing to worry about. That can also be very consoling for their families.</P>
    <P>From 1 January to 31 December 2001, 1,187 women attended the breast clinic for investigation at Tralee General Hospital, which illustrates its success. It also demonstrates the confidence women in Kerry have in the clinic and the clinic's personnel, including the nurses and consultants, who operate it. Eighty of these women were diagnosed early with cancer and are receiving treatment. Last year, I understand the surgeon carried out 40 operations in the hospital and since 27 January, 574 repeat visits were made to the clinic. Some 232 new patients have been seen since then, of which 21 were diagnosed with cancer. Consultants and GPs maintain that had this service not been available, the women in question would not have been seen as soon and, as is the experience of any Kerry patient seeking treatment in Cork, they would have had to join a waiting list at which point diagnosis may be have been too late.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister is present for this debate. I call on him to direct the Southern Health Board to designate Tralee General Hospital as a centre of excellence for symptomatic breast disease care. The Minister's colleague, Councillor Paul O'Donoghue, asked for a review of the designation of the two centres of excellence in Cork. At the last Southern Health Board meeting, he said that north Cork and parts of east of Cork could be seen as part of the Tralee General Hospital catchment area, with a centre in Cork and Kerry. He also raised this matter at a recent county council meeting and it is worth consideration.</P>
    <P>The service in Tralee needs an immediate injection of funding to ensure that an extension of services at the oncology unit can commence, including the provision of counselling services, which is very important. Kerry patients do not want to go through the trauma of travelling to Cork, resulting in psychological stress and major inconvenience to their families.</P>
    <P>Mr. Martin: I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The planning, organisation and management of services at Tralee General Hospital is, in <Col N="708" /> the first instance, a matter for the Southern Health Board. The Deputy is aware of the history of this issue. The report of the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum, Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, was published in March 2000. It set the 13 centres of excellence that should be established across the country. Rather than politicians making the decisions, it was clinicians and people with expertise in the area of oncology and breast cancer who made these recommendations, and they did so on the basis of survival rates. We should always remember as we debate this issue that the bottom line is what we can do to organise our cancer services to get the best survival rates for women. I know that is the concern of all and, as conveyed to me by the National Cancer Forum and the sub-committee, that was the fundamental issue that concerned them.</P>
    <P>The report referred to the establishment of a network of specialist breast units across the country &ndash; 13 in all &ndash; and the appropriate infrastructure, personnel and equipment that was needed for them. It also made recommendations on the siting of the units. I accepted the recommendations and as breast cancer remains a major public health issue, I am committed to ensuring that quality services are developed for symptomatic breast disease.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that women with breast disease are best served by a team of specialists working together and that women experience better outcomes if their cancer is managed in centres along the lines of the recommendations of the sub-group. The report advised that, based on the population in the board's functional area, it is appropriate that two centres of excellence be located in the south. The Southern Health Board's own proposals for the development of symptomatic breast disease services are informed by the report's recommendations. Accordingly, and in line with the recommendations of the report, the board agreed to develop two individual centres of excellence, located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital and Cork University Hospital. The centres will function as one unit with regard to audit, data, collection, protocols, teaching and quality assurance. On a day to day level, two individual teams of clinicians and specialist nurse working independently in the two hospitals will carry out the clinical management of patients with symptomatic disease.</P>
    <P>With regard to oncology services in Tralee General Hospital, the current services are being maintained. When this report was published we gave a commitment to people in Tralee and to local public representatives that we would not downgrade or run down the existing services there. That commitment still stands. It was requested at the time by public representative and members of the Southern Health Board from the Kerry area.</P>
    <P>A dedicated oncology unit in Tralee General Hospital was established in 1999 operating five days a week and staffed by an oncology nurse <Col N="709" /> specialist and three staff nurses. This unit functions as an integral part of the cancer services in the Southern Health Board. The specialist nurses in this unit co-ordinate the treatment of patients, manage side effects from cancer and chemotherapy and provide information and psychological support for patients and their families. It also co-ordinates care of patients attending other centres of chemotherapy and provides local support for patients and their families.</P>
    <P>The medical supervision of the oncology services provided at Tralee General Hospital is the responsibility of the consultant medical oncologist at Cork University Hospital, who attends Tralee General Hospital twice a month. In addition, there are plans for a medical registrar to attend at the unit twice a month from July onwards. A palliative care consultant is due to take up a post on 25 November 2002 and a dedicated social worker is also being recruited. It is anticipated that this post will be filled by September 2002. Those appointments will lead to an enhancement of services at the hospital.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns of the women of Kerry and the Deputy. The only motivation is to get our cancer services in the region up to international standards in terms of outcome and survival rates. That is the bottom line. The medical personnel across the region of Cork and Kerry are working together and are co-operating to try to ease the situation for patients in terms of convenience, which is important, and the trauma that can often result from having to travel and so on. They are also trying to arrange protocols to facilitate that.</P>
    <P>We in this House and elsewhere have an obligation to ensure that we keep focused on the big picture, which is to try to improve survival rates and to get the best cancer service we can in place gradually. We have made some progress over the last five years with the allocation of approximately &euro;100 million in funding and the appointment of 62 cancer consultants, but we have a long road to travel in terms of proper, expanded oncology and radiotherapy services, etc.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for his compliments on my re-appointment as Minister. I will focus strongly on outcomes and survival rates. I give him a commitment that there will be no running down of the services at Tralee General Hospital &ndash; rather, they will be enhanced. That will be the philosophy underpinning my work over the coming years.</P>

      <P>Más féidir, ba mhaith liom an t-am atá agam a roinnt leis an Teachta Cuffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé seafóideach go bhfuil an t-aon ionad athchursáil agus déantús buidéal sa Stáit ag dúnadh. Tá sé seafóideach chomh maith, agus muid ag tosnú i gceart ar stráitéis athchúrsáil, stáitéis chun níos lú bruscar a bheith againn agus stráitéis chun caomhnú a dhéanamh ar ár dtimpeallacht, <Col N="710" /> go bhfuil Gloinne Ardagh i Rinn a Séid i mBaile Átha Cliath ag dúnadh in ainneoin go bhfuil brabach á dhéanamh ag an chomhlacht. Molaim don Aire an t-airgead atá an Ríaltas ag fáil ón cáin ar mhálaí plaistic a úsáid chun an monarchan seo a choimeád oscailte nó a rith thar cheann an Stáit.</P>
    <P>Tá breis práinn leis a bhfuil á lorg agam toisc go bhfuil an chomhlacht tar éis a luaidh an dáta a bhfuil siad chun tús a chur leis an monarchan a dhúnadh. The management has picked 1 July as the date to begin winding down the plant and to leave over 400 workers without a job. This is without agreeing a redundancy package as proposed by the Labour Relations Commission. The Labour Relations Commission recommendation was five weeks pay for every year worked. What the workers are now being given by the company is the minimum statutory redundancy package.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take every step possible to either get the company to overturn its ridiculous plan to close this profitable plant or for the State to take over the running of this vital cog in the waste management strategy. The Government is duty bound to intervene even at this late stage to keep the plant open and to get the company to honour the LRC recommendation. If these steps are not taken and if the State does not take this opportunity, it will affect the implementation of the waste management strategy and will, as such, cost the State much more money in the long term as such a facility will have to be rebuilt or subsidised in the near future.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cuffe: I truly believe that this is a taste of the Government's commitment to waste management and to safeguarding jobs. The closure of the Ardagh Glass company will result not only in the loss of 400 jobs but also in the loss of a major recycling facility. Since 1991 we have had a great deal of discussion and hot air about waste reduction, reuse and recycling, but we have yet to see the substance rather than the rhetoric.</P>
    <P>We have seen the demise of milk bottle cleansing facilities and the milk bottle is now a collector's item. We have yet to see recycling of telephone directories and any major State agency other than the Department of the Environment and Local Government using recycled paper. We have yet to see proper recycling in the State and we now see the prospect of the closure of Ardagh Glass resulting in major difficulties for the recycling of glass. To add insult to injury, the people of Ringsend are about to get an incinerator at the same time as this plant closes down which is truly a symbol of the Government's lack of commitment to recycling.</P>
    <P>We need a guarantee of employment for these workers. We also need a new semi-State agency to handle all aspects of waste reduction, reuse and recycling so that rather than rhetoric there is substance to the many Government documents over the past several years that iterate a commitment to recycling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" />In order to safeguard the jobs in Ringsend and to give a brighter future for recycling, the Minister needs to intervene in the case of Ardagh Glass, not only to safeguard those 400 jobs but to make sure that recycling is given more than a paper thin commitment.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Teachta Ó Snodaigh as ucht an ábhar tábhachtach agus práinneach seo a árdú ar an Athló, agus don Teachta Cuffe chomh maith. Tá fhios agam go maith na deacrachtaí atá ag daoine ag a bhfuil post acu ansin. Tá suas le 400 post ann. Chuirfidh sé sin isteach go mór ar an cheanntar, ar na daoine agus ar na teaghligh go léir. Dár ndóigh, is cheist fíor-práinneach é, ní amháin do Rinsend agus do Baile Átha Cliath ach don tír go léir.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the closure of the Ardagh Glass plant in Ringsend with the loss of 375 jobs is a major blow to the area of Dublin, as well as to the workers involved, their families and the recycling sector. I understand that the decision to close the plant in Ringsend was based on commercial considerations. In this regard, I want to make it clear that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has no function in relation to the provision of industrial supports or in relation to disputes within commercial companies.</P>
      <P>Everyone is agreed that higher and sustained levels of recycling are crucial to dealing with the increased levels of waste which this country is producing. Glass recycling has been one of our relative success stories in recent years and many people have embraced the discipline of bringing their empty bottles to the local bottle bank. To date, most of the glass collected in the State has been recycled by Irish Glass &ndash; an estimated 37,000 tonnes last year. Our recycling rate is just over 30% of glass arising in Ireland but this is still at the lower end of European recycling rates. I appreciate that the closure of the Ringsend plant will make it more difficult to find markets for the existing tonnage of glass collected here and will be an added challenge in increasing our recycling rates to European norms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has kept in contact with Repak in recent months regarding the issue of glass recycling. The company was set up in 1997 as a producer responsibility scheme charged with meeting industry's recycling targets for packaging, including recycling of glass. To that effect, <Col N="712" /> Repak subsidises the collection and pre-processing of glass and it has an important role in assisting in finding alternative markets for the glass collected.</P>
    <P>I understand that alternative outlets for recycled glass are being established, including through export and the diversion of some glass to a glass manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland. Decisions on these issues are primarily a matter for the glass merchants and the company involved. We in the Department will continue to monitor developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>For the longer term, my Department will work with relevant key interests to facilitate greater use of glass in the construction sector. Last year a pilot road construction project on the N2 in County Monaghan utilised 350 tonnes of green glass as an element of the bituminous mix. This was a useful experiment, although I appreciate that it only absorbed a small fraction of the available glass. More extensive use should improve the economic viability of this alternative.</P>
    <P>The Department will work with the NRA and construction sector to develop suitable specifications to allow for more widespread use of glass in both road construction and for other construction uses. The National Construction and Demolition Waste Council, which is being established tomorrow, will have a key role in encouraging and developing the use of recycled material in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>There are many other innovative ways in which glass can be recycled, including in industrial abrasives, glass wool and fibreglass, construction aggregates, insulation material, filtration systems, landscape applications and ceramic glazes to mention but a few. The potential for such applications recently formed part of an extensive research study on the development of products for recycled materials carried out by the Clean Technology Centre, Cork.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the policy statement, &ldquo;Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering change&rdquo;, published in March, and the Government programme, a market development programme will be established under the aegis of the proposed national waste management board. This programme will address the measures necessary to develop innovative markets for recyclable materials generally over the coming years. It is hoped to establish the national waste management board shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 June 2002.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that, on the advice of the Government, the individual concerned was retired, by the President, with effect from a date in June 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954 and paragraph 18(1)(f) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo;. The amended text of DFR A15 paragraph 18(2) as amended in 1985 states: &ldquo;An officer shall not be recommended for retirement for misconduct or inefficiency or in the interests of the service unless or until the reasons for the proposed retirement have been communicated to him and he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making such representation as he may think proper in relation to the proposed retirement&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the formal amendment was made some considerable time after this individual's retirement, in the event the manner in which his retirement was dealt with was in fact consistent with the later 1985 amendment in that the reasons were made clear to him and he was given every reasonable opportunity to respond. His continued assertions that the reasons for his retirement were never made clear to him are difficult to comprehend given the facts of the case. Specifically, prior to his retirement, the person concerned would <Col N="714" /> have been made fully aware, in some considerable detail, of the circumstances giving rise to his retirement in June 1969. He was afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond to the issues raised and failed to do so. He was interviewed by officers of the intelligence section of the Army on three separate occasions in April 1969 in relation to a number of serious matters which had come to their attention.</P>
    <P>At the third of these interviews on 30 April 1969, the person in question volunteered to submit a statement in relation to the matters raised, but did not subsequently do so. Given the serious nature of the situation presented to the military authorities, they were of the opinion that to retain him in service would be contrary to the interests of the Defence Forces and of the State.</P>
    <P>The Deputy Judge Advocate General was requested to advise on the matter and he himself conducted a personal interview at his office with the officer concerned on 28 May 1969. The Deputy Judge Advocate General informed the officer that he had been asked to advise the General Staff in relation to the case and that he wished to give the officer concerned an opportunity to submit any statement he wished to make in relation to the very serious issues which had been raised in the April interviews. The officer advised the Deputy Judge Advocate General that, following the April interviews, he had consulted a solicitor who undertook to correspond with the military authorities on his behalf. The DJAG informed him that no such correspondence had been received.</P>
    <P>The Deputy Judge Advocate General took the officer through the issues raised in the April interviews, explained the gravity of the situation, advised him to consider the situation, and arranged a further meeting for the following day, at which the officer was to submit a statement. The officer raised the question as to whether he could consult his solicitor and the DJAG made it clear to the officer that there was no objection to such a course of action. When the officer returned the following day, 29 May 1969, he then advised the DJAG that he would not in fact be making any statement.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, given the very serious nature of the situation presented to the military authorities and in the absence of any response from the individual in question to the matters put before him, they were of the opinion that it would be contrary to the interests of the Defence Forces and the State to retain him in service.</P>
    <P>A decision to retire an officer &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo; is only taken for the most compelling reasons. Given that the Government decision and advice to the President concerned military security, I can say that I am satisfied that the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner in accordance with the relevant Defence Force regulations extant at the time. I am also satisfied that the individual's case was dealt with in a manner which was consistent with natural justice and in fact which met the criteria <Col N="715" /> which were later incorporated in Defence Force regulations by the amendment in question. The decision to recommend his retirement was taken only after very detailed and due consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of access to files, the person in question applied to the military authorities in May 1998 under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, for access to copies of all documents in relation to his retirement from the Permanent Defence Force and in relation to his period of service in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The military authorities issued their decision on the application on 12 June 1998. They advised him that the records sought did not come within the scope of relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, except in so far as the request related to &ldquo;personal information&rdquo;, as provided for in the Act. In this regard, he was advised that he could have access to all personal information contained in his file for the period in question.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the FOI Act, the individual, through his legal representatives, exercised his right to appeal the decision to the designated FOI internal appeals officer in the Defence Forces. The appeal was considered by the relevant officer, who upheld the initial decision. This decision was issued in writing to the applicant's legal representatives on 20 July 1998. Copies of the records which were deemed by the military decision makers to come within the scope of the FOI Act were forwarded to his then legal representatives in July 1998. When conveying his decision in relation to the internal review of the decision, the internal appeals officer advised the applicant of his statutory right of further appeal to the Information Commissioner, who is an independent officer with statutory powers to review decisions made by public bodies in relation to FOI applications. I understand that in July 1998, such an appeal was lodged in this case with the Office of the Information Commissioner. Such appeals are a matter for the Office of the Information Commissioner. However, I understand that the case was suspended in July 1998 at the request of the applicant's then legal representatives and was subsequently discontinued by the Information Commissioner's office in 1999, due to the subsequent non-pursuance of the matter by the individual concerned and his legal representatives at that time.</P>
    <P>I understand that on 17 July 2001 the individual made a further Freedom of Information request to the military authorities in relation to the records regarding his period of cadet training. These records were released in full by the military authorities. The applicant submitted an internal appeal in relation to the decision in relation to this application and was advised by the internal appeals officer that all records in relation to his period of service as a cadet had been released. I understand the applicant has now submitted an appeal on this decision to the Information Commissioner.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 the Government moved quickly and decisively to respond to the evolving international situation. In replies to previous questions to the House on 4 December 2001, I outlined details in relation to the establishment of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Planning.</P>
      <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted is continuing. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency. As chairman of the task force, I intend that such responses would be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.</P>
      <P>The task force continues to meet regularly to review the various emergency planning and response issues. The role of this task force is to ensure a co-ordinated and an effective response to large scale emergencies.</P>
      <P>The Office of Emergency Planning continues to provide a key support to the task force and co-ordinates the work of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Emergency Planning to meet the new threats arising from international terrorism. The existing lead role of Departments and agencies in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will of course continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to report to this House that there is a high level of co-operation between my Department and all other Departments and agencies through the Task Force on Emergency Planning, the Office of Emergency Planning and the Interdepartmental Working Group on Emer<Col N="717" /> gency Planning. These arrangements have provided the fora to significantly enhance the emergency planning process within all Departments and agencies and have helped to restore public confidence in the emergency planning process.</P>
    <P>The review of existing emergency plans has been conducted in the light of current developments and initial review shows that there are sound arrangements within the relevant Departments and agencies for dealing with emergency issues.</P>
    <P>Contact and liaison with emergency planning bodies in other countries, and also at EU and Partnership for Peace levels, confirms that all countries are grappling with the same emergency planning and response challenges. The Office of Emergency Planning will continue to maintain and develop such formal and informal contacts, in order to ensure that information on emergency planning issues is available to the emergency planning community and that the process in Ireland is benchmarked against international best practice.</P>
    <P>The focus for the office will be to ensure that the momentum behind emergency planning does not decline.</P>
    <P>I am keenly aware of the public confidence issue involved in emergency planning. It is imperative that the information being presented to both the media and the public be aimed at developing understanding of the issues and likely responses that any emergency may require.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the task force, I presented the first report of the task force to Government on 11 December 2001 and a further report on 10 April 2002. I would like to thank those who have been actively involved across a range of disciplines, Departments and agencies in supporting the work of the task force. I will continue to report regularly to Government and to this House on the progress being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>A service commitment scheme was introduced in 1997 for pilot officers of the Air Corps. This scheme applied primarily to experienced personnel who were rated on and flying the principal operational aircraft in the Air Corps. The scheme was introduced to assist in the retention in service of senior pilots in key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport. The gratuities available under the scheme were designed to strike a fair and reasonable balance between the demands of the external commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay. Pilot officers eligible for the scheme could <Col N="718" /> opt for either a three year or a five year service commitment and were entitled to a payment of £10,000, &euro;12,697, in respect of each of those years. Those committed to a five year period also earned a terminal bonus of £5,000, &euro;6,349.</P>
      <P>Such financial incentives are not uncommon in Defence Forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining highly qualified and readily marketable personnel. The scheme moreover was perceived to offer a more acceptable avenue of approach for all concerned than the imposition of any compulsory retention.</P>
      <P>The service commitment scheme was introduced for a two year period and was subsequently extended to eligible pilots in 1999, 2000 and 2001. A total of 19 pilots had opted to participate under the terms of the service commitment scheme by the time of closure of the scheme in July of last year. Application for entry to the scheme was, of course, entirely voluntary in nature.</P>
      <P>Proposals for a new scheme are at present being developed by the military authorities and officials of my Department and the Department of Finance. These discussions are nearing completion and I expect to be in a position to announce the revised terms in the near future.</P>

      <P>The provision of jobs is a day to day matter for the development agencies and not one for which I, as Minister, would have a direct function.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Louth Enterprise Board, which are the agencies under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for industrial development, are actively marketing Louth as a location for industry.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is about to start the development of a 63 acre business and technology park in Drogheda adjacent to the new motorway. After commencement of site works the agency will be in a position to seriously market this location. Planning permission has been received for approximately 180,000 square feet of office-light manufacturing space with construction of the first building to begin later in the year on securing a developer.</P>
      <P>In Dundalk, IDA Ireland will shortly be applying for planning permission for three units on Finnabair Business Park. In Ardee, IDA Ireland proposes to establish a pharmaceutical project, Galen. However, there is an issue still to be resolved regarding planning permission, and the realisation of the project ultimately depends on full planning permission being granted.</P>

      <Col N="721" />Enterprise Ireland, the industrial agency which deals with indigenous industry, as part of its regional strategy launched in 2001, is committed to driving growth in enterprise, and thereby jobs, in the regions, with particular emphasis on the counties in the BMW region. In 2002 Enterprise Ireland aims to commit in excess of 30% of its financial supports to projects in the BMW region including County Louth: approximately 25% of EI clients are currently located in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>The agency is working with its client companies and other key players in the regions to implement its regional development strategy, a feature of which was its June 2001 seminar aimed at encouraging Dublin-based companies to consider expansion or satellite operations in the regions. A number of new initiatives for companies in the Border counties have been introduced, in addition to Enterprise Ireland's existing programmes.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland's efforts to encourage and assist industry development is focused on export promotion, assisting the development of innovative products, encouraging new business start-ups with significant development potential, identifying deficits in the operating environment and promoting the north-east as an excellent location for Irish mobile investment. In its efforts to promote County Louth, Enterprise Ireland engages in the following activities such as a new community enterprise scheme, launched in April 2002; this scheme replaces the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Centre Scheme 1989-2001 under which centres were established in Dundalk and Ardee; the proposed establishment of a number of technology hubs nation-wide, termed &ldquo;Webworks&rdquo;, including one in County Louth; and the investment of &euro;95 million in 12 venture capital funds which will have a dedicated regional focus delivered through four of the funds.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to work closely with the Ardee Community Development Company Limited, in the community's efforts to develop a significant business park in the town, with the potential to house ICT-based business.</P>
    <P>Under the &lsquo;Micro-Enterprise' Measure of the Regional Operational Programme, the Louth County Enterprise Board continues, with EU funding, to support micro-enterprises employing under ten people, with financial intervention and entrepreneurial development of management and e-commerce skills, and enterprise education in second level schools. To date, 356 enterprises have been approved by Louth County Enterprise Board with 25% in a rural location and 75% in urban areas.</P>
    <P>With a remit to foster trade between North and South, InterTradeIreland is operating across all sections of industry, and with every conceivable shape and size of business, complementing the activities of its sister development agencies on the island. Key programmes cover graduate placement, equity awareness, business fora and public procurement and a number of businesses in County Louth have participated in some of these.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" />I am confident that the combined efforts of the industrial development agencies will result in improved prospects for employment growth in County Louth.</P>

      <P>The recently announced community enterprise centre scheme, to be administered by Enterprise Ireland, replaces the Enterprise Ireland community enterprise centre scheme which dated back to 1989, under which circa £6 million had been committed in supporting 63 community based enterprise centre developments nationally.</P>
      <P> The new scheme provides funding of &euro;8 million over the next two years, to support community based small business initiatives. The scheme will provide infrastructural facilities to support the establishment and expansion of micro enterprises, with local community participation. Priority will be given to supporting centres in areas of particular need, such as locations where there is a poor history of enterprise development, or where there is a lack of existing enterprise space with little prospect of any becoming available.</P>
      <P>The enterprise centres will be developed by community groups which adopt an acceptable legal structure. Typically, they will be non-profit taking and include broad based representation by the communities in which the centres are based. </P>
      <P>The initiative will operate in the form of a partnership between local communities and the State. It will be administered by Enterprise Ireland working in close co-operation with FÁS, the local authorities and by both the county and city enterprise boards and the county and city development boards along with Shannon Development.</P>
      <P>It is designed to actively encourage a flow of new start-up businesses throughout the regions and is an important part of Enterprise Ireland's regional development strategy. </P>
      <P>Support up to 50% of eligible expenditure, or &euro;400,000, whichever is the lesser, is available for communities within the BMW region. Support of up to 40% of eligible expenditure, or &euro;300,000, whichever is the lesser, is available for communities outside the BMW region. An additional 5% is available for projects located in the Clár programme districts.</P>
      <P>Also, support is available of up to 50% of eligible expenditure or &euro;38,000, whichever is the lesser, towards the recruitment of a centre manager, to be paid over a period not exceeding two years. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, support is also available of up to <Col N="723" /> 50% of eligible expenditure, or &euro;13,000, whichever is the lesser, to assist communities at the feasibility or pre-planning stages of a proposal. </P>
    <P>Applications, received under the first call for proposals, are now under consideration. It is expected that the successful applicants will be announced within eight weeks. A second call for proposals is expected to be announced towards the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 41 together</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many businesses and individuals are facing and of the problems this is creating for them.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents me and the Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>However, the Government intends to tackle the high costs of insurance by way of the comprehensive set of measures, which we have put forward in An Agreed Programme for Government.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to implement urgently the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB.</P>
      <P>The implementation group, which was set up at the end of April 2002, is making good progress on preparation of an action plan to give effect to the 67 recommendations. The action plan, which I intend to make publicly available, will contain a target timeframe for implementation of each recommendation by the Department or body concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Agreed Programme for Government also contains a commitment to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. Towards that end, I expect shortly to present to the Government, in accordance with the usual procedures, <Col N="724" /> the report of the Interdepartmental Implementation Group, which I can confirm I received recently. I intend to make the report public after it has been considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>The social partners have committed themselves in recent partnership proposals to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. As part of this commitment, the Workplace Safety Group, which enjoys the support of the HSA and social partners, is promoting a workplace safety code on safe working and accident prevention. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The establishment of an office to promote workplace safety with a chief executive and administrative assistant has been proposed. My Department will be involved in providing financial and other assistance towards getting this initiative off the ground.</P>
    <P>Complementary to the measures foreseen by the Government, discussions have taken place with ISME, IBEC, the Irish Insurance Federation and other bodies and enterprises concerning the availability and cost of insurance. I encourage them to develop, in consultation with their clients, innovative strategies for controlling risk.</P>

      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. Towards that end, I expect shortly to present to Government, in accordance with the usual procedures, the report of the Interdepartmental Implementation Group, which I can confirm I received recently. I intend to make the report public after it has been considered by the Government.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a series of measures aimed at tackling the high cost of insurance, particularly motor and employer liability insurance. These measures include the implementation of the 67 recommendations of the MIAB report, many of which have the potential to impact favourably on employer liability insurance as well; and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</P>
      <P>While employers' liability and public liability insurance is not compulsory in Ireland, surveys carried out indicate that approximately 90% of companies were covered either by commercial or self-insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" />The introduction of a statutory requirement for limited liability companies to have certain minimum levels of insurance cover in place while trading would be a radical departure from existing practice.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche Management Consultants Report on Insurance Costs in Ireland (1996) pointed out the following possible disadvantages to having compulsory employers' liability insurance: distortion of the market; special arrangements being needed to insure bad risks &ndash; as in the case of motor insurance &ndash; possibly increasing premiums overall; companies that currently do not have insurance are unlikely to have the highest safety standards; difficulties with restrictions on market capacity; and possible negative effect on safety in the workplace.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility that general insurers in other EU member states might be discouraged from writing business in the Irish market if employer liability and public liability cover were compulsory, since they would have to participate in arrangements designed to ensure that all risks could receive a quote. They would also have to contribute towards an uninsured employers fund.</P>
    <P>While I accept that there are also possible advantages to having compulsory employers' liability and public insurance, any such proposal would need careful consideration and would involve detailed consultation with the social partners. An Agreed Programme for Government indicates that urgent consultations on the issue of making employer liability insurance compulsory will be initiated.</P>

      <P>Where people lose their jobs by way of redundancy, FÁS has a procedure for putting supports in place prior to the date of redundancy to enable employers and employees to prepare for exit planning related to retraining or alternative job seeking.</P>
      <P>Where such redundancies affect large numbers, other agencies are involved, for example, IDA, Forfás, local enterprise boards, partnerships, LES and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>Appropriate supports include individual interviews, career evaluation, career planning, retraining or training upgrades and job matching with local vacancies that may exist. Where appropriate, specific training courses are set-up.</P>
      <P>Where the job losses are of a different nature and people register with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as unemployed, there is a standard procedure in place between FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to point such people towards the variety of FÁS services available to their particular needs.</P>
      <P>In both scenarios, the supports are delivered by FÁS throughout its network and are processed on an integrated basis through employment offices, training centres, community offices and services to employers.</P>
      <P>These interventions were a key component of the successful strategy pursued by the last Government that delivered economic and social progress through job creation with the resultant low unemployment rates.</P>
      <P>The new Government recently reaffirmed its commitment in the programme for Government which stated: &ldquo;FÁS will engage with redundant workers and people facing the prospect of long-term unemployment to ensure that the period out of work for a substantial number of people is kept to a minimum.&rdquo;  I can assure the Deputy that it is a commitment that will be delivered on.</P>
      <P>Given the current economic conditions and the projections for the remainder of the year, FÁS is confident that adequate financial and other resources are available to serve the needs of these clients.</P>

      <P>Research has shown that insurance premiums are high in <Col N="727" /> Ireland mainly due to the number and level of compensation awards to policyholders. The costs of delivery of compensation run at approximately 40% of the cost of claims.</P>
      <P>While reports indicate that employer's liability insurance costs are higher in Ireland than in other member states, this may be attributable to the differences in social provision between Ireland and other EU member states. In many EU countries medical expenses and loss of earnings are largely, if not totally, provided for by the State. Where such arrangements are in place, they may operate through partial recoverability against employers but, of course, they do have implications in relation to the level of taxes on employment in those countries.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. Towards that end, I expect shortly to present to Government, in accordance with the usual procedures, the report of the interdepartmental implementation group, which I can confirm I received recently. I intend to make the report public after it has been considered by the Government. It is expected that PIAB will, in the course of time, substantially reduce the number of personal injury claims being brought to court, thus reducing the legal and other costs involved in the delivery of personal injury compensation.</P>

    <P>In anticipation of the receipt of revenue from property sales, substantial additional money has been provided in the Defence Estimate in the past few years. This has resulted in an unprecedented level of investment in equipment and infrastructure in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>A total of &euro;230 million has been invested on equipment since 1997 and the White Paper on Defence allows for an unprecedented &euro;320 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure over the next decade. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
    <P>Substantial programmes of investment are taking place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as follows. The initial contract for the supply of armoured personnel carriers to the Defence Forces is now complete with all 40 APCs delivered to the Curragh Camp by Mowag in Switzerland. The contract has the option of the purchase of further APCs from Mowag and the take-up of this option will be considered later this year. There has been significant investment on new vehicles including specialist transport cargo vehicles &ndash; deployed to KFOR &ndash; and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4's, and ¾ ton trucks. More than &euro;13 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. The planned investment package for the Army in the next three years includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces is also under way.</P>
    <P>On 17 January 2002, following on from a tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters, I authorised the Department to open negotiations with Sikorsky for the supply of the S-92 helicopter. One of the unsuccessful companies, Eurocopter, have now commenced proceedings in the High Court challenging my decision. Sikorsky have been joined as a notice party to the proceedings. The pre-trial procedural steps are being undertaken as expeditiously as possible by all parties. The matter is due for mention in the High Court on Monday 24 June 2002.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of up to eight training aircraft for the Air Corps is regarded as a top priority by the Department. The request for tender documents have issued in this regard and tenders are due back on 26 July 2002.</P>
    <P>The second new ship for the Naval Service LE <i>Niamh</i>, which is a sister ship of LE <i>Róisín</i> was commissioned into the Naval Service last September. As with LE <i>Róisín</i>, the new ship cost more than &euro;25 million and already is proving to be a tremendous asset to the Naval Service in carrying out its various roles. The ship has <Col N="729" /> recently returned from a very successful trade mission to the far east.</P>
    <P>With regard to infrastructure, approximately &euro;112 million has been expended on a capital building programme from 1997 to 2001. Furthermore, another &euro;42 million has been provided for further capital works in 2002, a grand total of &euro;156 million. In addition, almost &euro;50 million has been &ndash; or will be spent &ndash; on non-capital maintenance works from 1997 to 2002 inclusive.</P>

      <P>Participation in PfP activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation.</P>
      <P>Existing equipment programmes were set out in the White Paper on Defence. Future equipment requirements are the subject of examination within my Department by the high level civilmilitary planning and procurement group established under the White Paper and are being funded from within the existing procurement financial provisions and savings realised from the reduction in Permanent Defence Forces personnel numbers and the sale of property which is surplus to requirements. Participation in Partnership for Peace does not impose any new commitments in the area of procurement.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence recognises that the primary focus of the Defence Forces, when not engaged on operations, is training and preparation. The appropriate training for all Defence Forces formations and units is based on conventional military doctrine to prepare them to fulfil the roles laid down by Government, including overseas peace support operations.</P>
      <P>To date the Defence Forces have, and continue to, participate in PfP partnership programmes and the PfP planning and review process, PARP, with a view to enhancing interoperability with our PfP partners. The aim is to create the conditions in which different contingents can work together efficiently and effectively in peace support operations.</P>
      <P>The details of Ireland's participation in PfP are set out in our two Individual Partnership Programmes IPP's the first of which covered the period up to 31 December 2001 and the second which covers the period 2002-03. Both of the IPP's have been lodged in the Dáil Library. Activities consist of training courses, seminars, workshops, conferences and table top exercises.</P>

      <P>As part of its education and training policy the Defence Forces have, for many decades, conducted an active programme of overseas courses and visits to other defence forces. This programme is designed to meet a number of important Defence Forces training needs: doctrinal development which is maintained by attendance at command and staff courses abroad, for example in the UK, the USA and France; instructor capacity courses aim to maintain, update and multi-skill the Defence Forces instructor base and are attended primarily in the UK; PfP-EU interoperability means that there is a requirement to send personnel on courses abroad to develop within the Defence Forces a thorough awareness and familiarity with the PfP operational and logistical doctrine and the procedures required by units if they are to function effectively and efficiently as part of any future multinational peace support operation; and with regard to equipment, some courses and visits with other forces are designed to support expenditures on equipment already purchased.</P>
      <P>This external programme of training encompasses personnel from all services, Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service. The programme is continuous as the ongoing need for new training arises with changes in policy, procedures and the purchase of new equipment.</P>
      <P>The Army ranger wing also undergoes a number of specialised training courses with other armed forces.</P>
      <P>An exchange visit of cadets will take place between the Belgian Military Academy and the Cadet School in July.</P>

      <P>The total number of Defence Forces personnel currently serving overseas is 518. Full details are listed in the tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of Defence Forces participation in overseas missions is kept under regular review. Requests from the United Nations for Irish participation in new missions are considered on a <Col N="731" /> case by case basis within the context of the United Nations stand-by arrangement system. As I have indicated in the House previously, in October 1998 Ireland signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations in relation to UNSAS. Ireland has committed up to 850 Defence Forces personnel for UN service at any one time under this system. There is no obligation to participate in any particular mission and Dáil approval is required for the despatch of a contingent to a specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>

      <P>The most recent CSO data shows that there were 143,900 farms in 1999, 146,300 in 1998 and 147,800 in 1997. This means farm numbers declined by 2,400 and 1,500 across those years. This trend in declining farm numbers is not specific to Ireland &ndash; indeed it is mirrored in developed countries all over the world.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the preservation of the maximum viable number of full and part-time farmers. Due to this commitment I established the Agri-Food 2010 Committee in June 1999 &ldquo;to propose a strategy for the development of Irish agriculture and food over the decade to 2010.&rdquo;  This independent committee invited and received submissions from interested individuals and organisations and produced a report in March 2000. In response to its report I initiated an extensive round of consultations with organisations representing consumer, farmer and other interests. The Government's policy response to the Agri-Food 2010 report is contained in the Agri-Food 2010 plan of action.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plan makes a clear commitment to maintaining the maximum number of farmers and envisages a dynamic agri-food sector in 2010 which offers farm families attractive and sustainable livelihood options, thus ensuring the <Col N="733" /> maintenance of the maximum number on the land; has the necessary strength and capabilities to successfully compete within the EU and on our main third country markets; is focused on meeting consumer demands, particularly for the highest standards of food safety; and values our rural environment as the basis for thriving rural communities.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the campaign currently being run by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group. The current VAT treatment of charitable organisations is based on EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply. Under the sixth VAT directive a wide range of charitable and voluntary activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This <Col N="735" /> means that the organisations involved do not charge VAT on their services but, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT they bear on the goods and services that they purchase in the course of their activities. It is estimated that the cost of any refund mechanism as proposed by the ICTRG would be significantly in excess of &euro;63 million.</P>

    <P>The year-on-year spending increase of 27% shown at the end of May exceeded the annual increase of 14% provided in the Estimates. Year-on-year percentage increases during the early part of the year are affected by a variety of factors such as the timing of payments this year, the level of spending in the corresponding period last year and the absolute size of the figures being compared.</P>
    <P>Spending to date is less than profiled by Departments and offices. Also 41% of the total allocation has been spent which is to be expected if there is an even pattern of spending throughout the year.</P>

      <P>At budget time the forecast for the 2002 Exchequer balance was for a surplus of &euro;170 million. This estimate remains unchanged. At budget time the forecast for the general Government balance was &euro;837 million. The estimate for the 2002 general Government balance was published in the March EU Maastricht return was for a surplus of &euro;690 million.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures for Exchequer receipts and expenditure were those for the period up to 31 May published on my Department's website on 5 June. This shows a surplus of &euro;56 million for the period up to the end of May.</P>
      <P>While the performance of individual tax and non-tax subheads will vary, receipts will improve as the economy continues to recover and the full impact of the Budget revenue raising measures is felt. Similarly, there are different levels of spending to date this year by Departments and I am determined that Departments will have to manage within their approved allocations.</P>

    <P>In 2002 the pay bill will amount to &euro;11,550 million. This includes a &euro;150 million budget day provision for benchmarking, an increase of 13.4% over the 2001 figure of &euro;10,187.</P>
    <P>In 2002 increases arising from PPF and other pay rate increases account for an increase of 6.5% or 48.5% of the overall increase. Other factors, mainly extra numbers employed but also including the &euro;150 million provision for the cost of benchmarking, account for an increase of 6.9% or 51.5% of the overall increase.</P>
    <P>The health sector accounts for 40% of the total pay bill and has shown the greatest increase in the period. The education sector accounts for 30% while the Civil Service accounts for 13.8%. The security sector and the non-commercial State bodies accounts for 12% and 4.2% respectively.</P>

      <P>Supplementary Estimates represent departmental estimations of additional moneys required towards the end of the year to meet both known and anticipated pressures on spending.</P>
      <P>In the normal course, some anticipated pressures will not materialise or will be offset by savings across the range of Votes. The end year expenditure outturn is often considerably lower than the total Estimates voted by the Dáil, that is original plus Supplementary Estimates. This was the position in 2001. The outturn exceeded the original Estimate by &euro;349 million or just 1.4%. Of this total voted current spending exceeded the original current Estimate by &euro;190 million or 0.9% and voted capital spending exceeded the original capital Estimate by &euro;160 million or 3.4%.</P>
      <P>The absolute value of spending, which I approved by way of Supplementary Estimate in 2001, totalled &euro;850 million or 3.4% of the original Estimate.</P>

      <P>The Government holds the person and the office of the Dalai Lama in the highest regard and considers him to be a significant force for moderation given the present circumstances which exist in Tibet. His Holiness is always welcome to visit Ireland whenever he wishes.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that in its bilateral contacts with China, and through the EU, Ireland has consistently called on the Chinese Government to respect the rights of the Tibetan people and to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>Last September the Taoiseach raised the situation in Tibet during his meeting with the Chinese Premier, Mr. Zhu, in Dublin. He called for a dialogue between the affected parties with a view to overcoming the current impasse.</P>
      <P>I reiterated this position during my meeting in Beijing with my Chinese counterpart, Minister Tang, on 23 January. I highlighted the level of concern in Ireland in relation to Tibet and strongly encouraged the Chinese authorities to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama on the issues of concern.</P>

    <P>Ireland is also pursuing the issue of Tibet through the EU-China human rights dialogue, <Col N="743" /> which has proven to be the most effective fora in which to raise human rights issues of concern with the Chinese authorities. At the last session of the Dialogue on 5-6 March, the EU raised its concern about the problem in Tibet, in the context of the political and cultural rights of minorities. The EU put forward its concerns, in particular over the detention of monks, closure of monasteries, and discrimination in population control policies.</P>
    <P>The issue was also raised at the 58th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which recently took place in Geneva. In its statement on the human rights situation worldwide the EU highlighted the problem in China, and Tibet in particular.</P>

      <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed about aspects of the biology paper and, in accordance with normal procedures, any concerns expressed to my Department are being forwarded to the chief examiner. Our examination system is acknowledged to be one of the most open, transparent and pro-candidate national examination systems in the world. A cornerstone of this openness and transparency is precisely those mechanisms that are in place to take on board genuine concerns that interested parties, including schools and students, might have in relation to the examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over and above any individual observations submitted, as a matter of course, subject associations and the teacher unions regularly each year provide observations on question paper content to the Department in advance of each marking conference. All observations received in relation to a subject are made available to the chief examiner for consideration in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject. The marking <Col N="751" /> scheme is developed at the marking conference by the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are drawn from teachers of the subject. In the case of biology, experienced teachers acting as examiners are able to input their own considered views into the formulation of the marking scheme.</P>
    <P>As it has been the practice for a number of years to publish the detailed marking schemes used in the marking process, all interested parties will be able to satisfy themselves in relation to the marking process that applies in the case of biology this year. Furthermore any candidate who chooses to view their marked script will have access to the marking scheme and will be able to see at first hand precisely how the finalised marking scheme applied in their own case. I strongly believe it would be utterly inappropriate for me or indeed any Minister or politician to interfere in the work of the chief examiner and the team of examiners who are the experienced practitioners as they follow these long-established practices.</P>

      <P>The home-school community liaison scheme was established in 1990 and is a key element in my Department's strategy to combat educational disadvantage. Under this scheme, co-<Col N="752" /> ordinators are assigned to schools in disadvantaged areas to work with school staff, parents and relevant community agencies in advancing the educational interests of children. The scheme seeks to address the discontinuity between the children's home and community experiences and the demands of schooling by maximising active participation of targeted pupils in the learning process and by promoting active co-operation and collaboration between home, school and community. A national co-ordinator oversees the day-today operation of the scheme and promotes its development.</P>
      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme is currently being reviewed by the Education Research Centre for my Department. In addition to examining the impact of the scheme and how efficiently and effectively the scheme has achieved its objectives, this review will help to inform future policy and practice in relation to the development of school, family and community linkages as a means of addressing educational disadvantage. At present there are 309 primary schools and 211 second level schools included in the home-school-community liaison scheme. I am arranging for a list of the schools to be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>The new foster care allowance scheme, which was introduced in August 2001, was designed to give effect in practice to the recommendations contained in the report of the working group on foster care, Foster Care: A Child-Centred Partnership. The report recommended that all payments made in addition to the basic foster care allowance should be abolished and that the basic allowance should be increased.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that orphan's allowances and pensions should not be paid in respect of children in respect of whom foster care allowances were being paid. However, it was not possible to implement these recommendations in exactly the manner set out in the report. The new foster care allowance scheme is designed to achieve the same objective which is to provide an adequate level of payment to foster carers to enable them to look after their children and to ensure that all children in foster care are treated fairly and equitably. The new scheme has therefore substantially increased the foster care allowance and has incorporated the orphan's allowance-pension.</P>

      <P>The planning, organisation and management of services at Tralee General Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board. As the Deputy is aware, the report of the sub-group of the national cancer forum Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease was published in March 2000 and contains recommendations for the establishment of a network of specialist breast units throughout the country, and the appropriate infrastructure, personnel and equipment which is needed for such specialist units. The report also makes recommendations regarding the siting of such units in each health board area. The report recommends that, based on the population in the board's functional area, it is appropriate that two centres of excellence be located in the south. The report also recommends that women with breast disease are best served by a team of specialists working together and that women experience better outcomes if their cancer is managed in centres developed along the lines of the sub-group report.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board's own proposals for the development of symptomatic breast disease services are informed by the report's recommendations. Accordingly, in line with the recommendations of the report, the board is to develop two individual symptomatic breast disease centres of excellence, located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital and Cork University Hospital. These centres will function as one unit with regard to audit, data collection, protocols, teaching and quality assurance. On a day to day management level, two individual teams of clinicians and specialists nurses working independently in the two hospitals will carry out the clinical management of patients with symptomatic breast disease.</P>
      <P>The current level of oncology services in Tralee General Hospital are being maintained. A dedicated oncology unit was established in 1999, operating five days a week and staffed by an oncology nurse specialist and three staff nurses. The specialist nurses in this unit co-ordinate the treatments for patients, manage side effects from cancer and chemotherapy and provide information and psychological support for patients and their families. The unit also co-ordinates care of patients attending other centres for chemotherapy and provides local support for patients and their families. The medical supervision of the oncology services provided at Tralee General Hospital is the responsibility of the consultant medical oncologist in Cork University Hospital who attends at Tralee General Hospital twice per month. The continued development of oncology services in Tralee General Hospital is also a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the provision of health services at Mayo General Hospital is the statutory responsibility in the first instance of the Western Health Board. The board has informed me that there is one consultant rheumatologist at present in the Western Health Board based at Merlin Park Regional Hospital and services for patients from the Mayo area are provided by this consultant. I understand from the Western Health Board that the provision of a consultant rheumatologist at Mayo General Hospital is being considered in the context of the development of the orthopaedic services at Mayo.</P>
      <P>The board is preparing a strategic plan for the development of rheumatology services. This strategic plan is at a very advanced stage and will be placed before the Western Health Board for consideration and adoption within the next two to three months. The further development of rheumatology services in the Western Health Board region will be considered in the context of additional funding available for acute hospital service developments in 2003 and the associated competing priorities.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the risks of assault on psychiatric nurses. I can inform him that I have established an appropriate task force to investigate the incidence and the reasons for assaults on psychiatric nurses. While it is recognised that it may be difficult to deal with the issue of a compensation scheme in relation to any one group of health service workers in isolation <Col N="757" /> from other public sector groups, regard will be had to the recommendations of the task force on the feasibility of an appropriate compensation scheme. Membership of the task force includes representatives of the relevant nursing unions &ndash; PNA and SIPTU &ndash; the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance. The task force held its first meeting on the 12 June 2002. Every effort will be made to ensure that the task force completes its work by 1 December 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Directions on the recruitment and selection of staff to children's residential centres were issued by my Department in November 1994. Under these directions employers must obtain Garda clearance on all staff being considered for appointment to a children's residential centre. In September 1995, these directions were extended to the recruitment of staff to any area of the health services where they would have substantial access to children and vulnerable individuals. The directions include standard documentation to be used as part of the Garda clearance procedure. The directions also stress that it is important that employers validate information supplied by candidates and verify references pro-actively. The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has reiterated this point in the past stating, <i>inter alia,</i> that irrespective of whatever clearance arrangements are in place, it is necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants suitability for jobs and that there is a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality <Col N="758" /> and Law Reform has informed me that a central vetting unit was established within the Garda Síochána in January 2002 in response to requests for an enhanced clearance system for employment related to children and vulnerable young adults and following a comprehensive review of Garda clearance arrangements in this area. The primary role of the Garda central vetting unit is to check prospective employees who as part of their duties will have substantial access to children or vulnerable adults. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also informed me that the new unit will provide a better service, with reduced delays, in respect of those employees covered by the existing system; it will have the capacity to respond to the significant increase in applications for clearances which have been experienced even under the present limited criteria, and it will provide a basis for a phased extension of the existing clearance system in respect of child-related employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The evolving role of my Department and, indeed of the health promotion unit, is reflected in the national health strategy and the national health promotion strategy. These state that if the Department is to address the key areas which it has outlined as being of strategic importance, it is crucial for it to strike the appropriate balance between its day-to-day operational work and the work required to plan, develop, monitor and review the services and the environment in which they are delivered. Thus, the executive function of the health promotion unit of my Department is being devolved to the health boards allowing its policy function to be strengthened. The health boards now have a statutory obligation to develop health promotion programmes bearing in mind the needs within each area and the objectives of the Department in relation to health promotion generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To meet the objectives of La Leche League of Ireland and to continue the promotion of breastfeeding throughout Ireland it is essential that there are effective linkages between all stakeholders. La Leche League have applied for and received funding on an <i>ad hoc</i> annual basis from the health promotion unit over the last decade. However, while the unit does provide some funding to voluntary groups, it is not in a position to <Col N="759" /> provide core funding to such groups. Consequently, my Department has recommended that La Leche League make contact with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority with regard to their baseline-core funding needs in order to ensure the proper co-ordination and development of services at regional level. These linkages will allow for a greater degree of integration and continuity of services.</P>

    <P>The spending to April is some 3% in excess of the period budget. Some upward adjustment of the budget is due when the half year review of the waiting list initiative and bed capacity initiative is completed. In addition, some further adjustments on the pay side are likely following clearance of pay award costings. All of these issues will have the result of lowering the reported excess, though it is not clear at this stage what the precise value of this reduction will be. When comparing the expenditure pattern to that recorded in 2001 for the same period, the increase over budget in 2001 was 5%. The year end result for 2001, based on the unaudited accounts, shows an overall excess of &euro;8 million or 115% on approved spending levels.</P>
    <P>The Department, together with the authority and health boards, is continually reviewing the expenditure outcomes in order to manage both the financial and service delivery aspects presenting. It should be mentioned that acute hospital output has recorded increases of 10% in day case activity and 2% in respect of all discharges in 2002 over 2001. I am confident that, as demonstrated in 2001, the ERHA and health boards will succeed in managing their overall financial affairs within the limits as approved for 2002.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the recruitment of staff and for monitoring the level of vacancies in the health service lies with the employing health agency. My Department collects data on vacancy levels for key professions central to the delivery of services, including medical, nursing and health and social care professionals, but does not hold information centrally on the total number of vacancies affecting the upwards of 100,000 persons currently employed in the health sector.</P>
      <P>In so far as medical personnel are concerned, the total number of approved consultant posts in the public health system currently stands at 1,650 which is well in excess of the number recommended by the Tierney report on consultant staffing which proposed a staffing complement of 1,500 by the year 2003. I have been informed by Comhairle na nOspidéal that the number of hospital consultant posts approved but not currently filled on a permanent basis is 195. However, I understand that a large number of these vacant posts are currently filled in a temporary capacity and are in the process of being filled on a permanent basis. I have also been informed by Comhairle na nOspidéal that approximately 50 of the 92 temporary consultant posts approved to support the waiting list initiative have been filled to date. In addition, I have been advised by the Health Services Employers Agency that the total number of whole-time non-consultant hospital doctor vacancies currently stands at 51.5, representing a low vacancy rate of approximately 1.4%.</P>
      <P>In respect of nursing, the HSEA undertakes a survey of nursing staff resources on an ongoing basis. As at 31 January 2002, while all sectors reported that recruitment of nurses was well ahead of the required replacement level, there were a total of 1,089 nursing vacancies in an employment complement of around 30,000. It should be noted that the end-January 2002 figures represents a significant decrease, approaching 20%, in the level of vacancies as compared to the position at end-November 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed information on vacancies for certain therapy professions is contained in the report by Peter Bacon and Associates, Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, commissioned by my Department and published in July 2001. This report identified a total of about 200 vacant posts in physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy in the health boards and the Dublin academic teaching hospitals. However, this should be set against the increase in excess of 400 &ndash; 35% &ndash; in employment in these professions in the health service over the three years to end-2000. In order to ensure that the quality of patient care is maintained, health service employers minimise the impact on service provision of vacancies in key <Col N="763" /> health professional grades through the use of overtime, agency staff, locums, contract staff and by adjusting the skills mix, as appropriate. For example, in nursing, the HSEA survey disclosed that the utilisation of agency nurses and overtime working provides the service-equivalent of around 1,270 full-time nurses.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that intensive efforts continue to be undertaken to improve staffing levels including the provision of an increased number of training places, concerted recruitment of health care professionals from overseas and the enhancement of human resource management, in line with the objective set out in the health strategy to continue to transform the health service into an employer of choice so as to maximise the retention of personnel.</P>
    <P>Continued investment in information technology together with the development of integrated workforce planning for the health service on a national basis, a key action specified in the health strategy, is expected to make a major contribution in the future to the provision of quality employment-related information and the development of a human resources inventory for the health service.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review titled &ndash; Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review &ndash; which was published on 16 January 2002, helped to inform the Government in its decision to provide a total of 3,000 additional acute beds for public patients over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. The commissioning of over 700 of these beds is being advanced by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. The estimated cost in current terms of providing an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds over the next ten years is &euro;483 million revenue and &euro;1270 million capital. The process of identifying the additional staffing requirement, which is necessary for the commissioning of these additional beds, will be advanced by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in conjunction with my Department.</P>

      <P>A number of significant initiatives have been taken to improve services in accident and emergency departments. A &euro;40.63 million investment package was provided by the previous Government in the winter of 2000-01 aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. This investment package provided for the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants and for the contracting of additional private nursing home places for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted more than 700 beds under this initiative in the winter of 2000-01. This level of funding was repeated over the period October 2001-March 2002 and has been of significant benefit to health agencies in responding to the high level of demand for hospital beds over the winter periods.</P>
      <P>Funding was also provided by the previous Government to the ERHA and the health boards to support a further range of initiatives in accident and emergency departments. These include: £5.19 million towards the development of accident and emergency facilities at St. James's Hospital; the provision of minor injuries units in Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St. James's and Tallaght hospitals; development of an accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital; extension to the accident and emergency department at St. Columcille's Hospital; development of pilot services for deep venous thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital; provision of a chest pain service at St. James's Hospital; the provision of a pilot discharge lounge in Beaumont Hospital; the recruitment of discharge planners and patient liaison personnel at accident and emergency sites in the eastern region; development of new accident and emergency department at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; development of new accident and emergency department at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street; planning of a new accident and emergency department for Cork University Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Galway University Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Castlebar General Hospital; development of accident and emergency department at Tullamore General Hospital; appointment of a design team for the development of a new accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital; and upgrading of accident and emergency facilities at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Monaghan General Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, has conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of that review entitled, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &ndash; A National Review, the previous Government decided to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. On 16 January 2002, a &euro;65 million investment package was announced by me for the com<Col N="765" /> missioning of 709 of these 3,000 beds in acute hospitals. Commissioning of the 709 beds is currently under way by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards.</P>
    <P>A major refocus on primary care services, marked by the introduction of new models of care involving core multi-disciplinary primary care teams, which will work with a wider network of health and social care professionals and which will offer 24 hour cover to patients, has taken place. This will also help to reduce demand from, and treat appropriately, patients who would otherwise have to attend at an accident and emergency department. This sector will therefore take on a pivotal role in helping to reduce pressures in accident and emergency departments. Investment of &euro;17.29 million will be made in the development of this service in 2002.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives have been identified in the national health strategy which are designed to improve the operation of accident and emergency departments. These include: the establishment of minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in accident and emergency departments; the appointment of advanced nurse practitioners in acute hospitals; the use of admission protocols to ensure that emergency patients will be the only group of patients admitted to hospital through accident and emergency departments; the appointment of additional personnel to liaise with patients while they await diagnosis and treatment at accident and emergency departments; and the introduction of information systems that record comprehensive, comparable and reliable data on activity in accident and emergency departments. Such information will provide staff with a valuable tool in structuring services to meet the needs of patients.</P>
    <P>At my request, Comhairle na nOspidéal has undertaken a review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments. The report of the review entitled, Report of the Committee on Accident &amp; Emergency Services, examines and makes recommendations on the provision of emergency services in public hospitals in the State. It explores factors that affect efficiency and effectiveness of hospital emergency services and links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows throughout the hospitals. I am confident that its work will contribute significantly to advancing the existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services as set out in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that action was taken earlier this year by nursing staff employed in accident and emergency departments in order to highlight difficulties being experienced in service provision. Proposals put forward by the Labour Relations Commission aimed at resolving the difficulties which had arisen were accepted by all <Col N="766" /> parties. One of the proposals included a requirement that a national accident and emergency nursing staffing structures review group would be established to carry out an immediate examination of existing structures and staffing levels in accident and emergency departments. In this regard, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that both sides have agreed on an independent examination to take place in a timely fashion.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I established an accident and emergency forum to identify urgent measures which can be taken to enhance accident and emergency services in acute hospitals, consistent with the commitment in the health strategy. Participants included hospital management, members of the medical and nursing professions, para-medical and non-nursing personnel, staff representative associations and unions, patient advocacy groups and other interested parties. The work of the forum, which took place on 20 March and 1 May this year, will help build on the existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services as set out in the strategy. A number of short, medium and long-term actions aimed at alleviating service pressures were identified and these will now be advanced by the national partnership forum through the involvement of partnership groups at local level. I am committed to ensuring that accident and emergency departments are in a position to respond to the need for their services. I am confident that hospital management and staff in hospitals providing accident and emergency services will continue to work together to respond to any difficulties presenting and to ensure that a high quality service continues to be provided to patients in the best conditions possible.</P>

      <P>In April 1999, information from the National Intellectual Disability Database indicated that in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,677 new residential and 912 new day places were required to meet the identified needs for these services. Since 2000, over 900 new residential and over 2,000 new day places have been provided. It should be noted that in addition to the day places required to meet the needs of those awaiting placement in the services as mentioned above, the additional funding also provided for those requiring a change in day services, for example, young people leaving school and requiring rehabilitative training places or those moving from rehabilitative training to other areas of the services such as sheltered work, activation or services for older people. In relation to residential services, in some cases, an enhanced level of support would also have been provided for those already in receipt of some level of residential services.</P>

      <Col N="767" />My Department is reviewing on an ongoing basis the position in relation to the implementation of this development programme with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Information will be available within the next few weeks from the National Intellectual Disability Database in relation to the level of service provision and identified need as of 31 May 2001, which will reflect the impact of the 2000 development programme. Further information in respect of service provision and identified need as of 31 May 2002, will be available later this year. This information will also assist my Department in this matter. The national monitoring committee, which is representative of my Department, the Health Research Board, the chief executives of the health boards, the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Intellectual Disability, the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland are also involved in the monitoring of this programme.</P>
    <P>The number of persons with an intellectual disability accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in May 2002 was 485, down from 970 in 1996. There is a specific reference to this programme in the health strategy with the objective of completing the programme as soon as possible and not later than 2006. It is also included in the programme for Government. I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to fulfilling the commitment which it gave in relation to meeting the needs of this population group, as outlined in the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>A notification was received from Dublin Bus on 10 April 2002, as required by a direction issued under the Transport (Re-organisation of Coras Iompair Eireann) Act, 1986, advising of the proposed introduction of a new service route 102. This new service arises from the amalgamation of routes 230 and 102. Dublin Bus was advised by my Department that the new route conflicted with an existing licensed service provided by a private operator in respect of some Sunday morning services. A copy of this licence was forwarded to Dublin Bus and they were asked to consider minor amendments to the timetable for the new service to take account of the existing licensed service. A response is still awaited from Dublin Bus. On receipt of this revised timetable a decision will be given to Dublin Bus on its proposed new route.</P>

      <P>My Department's guidelines for planning authorities on residential density, published in September 1999, set out the types of locations appropriate for higher residential densities, the range of densities appropriate to various locations and the need to achieve a high quality of residential environment. The guidelines specifically provide that one of the criterion to be taken into account by planning authorities in considering applications for higher density housing development is the &ldquo;provision of an appropriate scaled range of social and community facilities, including shopping, education, health and child care. Any planning applications for higher density development would be considered by planning authorities in the context of their development plans. Section 10 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides that each development plan must contain objectives for, <i>inter alia: </i>the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, <Col N="771" /> community and cultural requirements of the area and its population; the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities; and the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community, including, in particular, schools, crèches and other educational and child care facilities.</P>
      <P>I am therefore satisfied that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that a high quality residential environment is achieved in relation to all new higher density housing and I have no proposal at this time to review policy in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002, provides for the amendment of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts to facilitate the implementation of the first stage of the modernisation programme for the civil registration service. In particular, it provides for the introduction of electronic registers of births and deaths and the electronic production of certificates of birth, death and marriage.</P>
      <P>The implementation of electronic registration procedures is a key first step underpinning the integration of public services and delivery of e-government objectives which will be implemented via the public service broker currently being developed by the REACH agency operating under the aegis of my Department. The building blocks for this new service were put in place with the legislation introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in 1998 providing for the use of the personal public service number as a public service identifier and as a framework for the sharing of information between public service agencies for specified services. The 1998 legislation specified an tArd Chlariatheoir as a body which could use the PPS number as an identifier. The inclusion of relevant PPS numbers in the 2002 Act is the practical application of this objective. Over time, this will mean that records of births, marriages and deaths will be linked through the use of the PPS number. This linking of events will provide assistance in the future for checking that people are free to marry and that a deceased person's identity cannot be abused.</P>
      <P>The Act provides for the inclusion of both the child's and his or her parents' PPS numbers in the registration of a birth and also makes provision for the registration of a deceased person's PPS number in the registration of a death. However, the Act specifically provides that the certificates of both births and deaths will not include the PPS numbers of the persons concerned. The Act provides that the personal data collected at birth registration will also be used for the purpose of allocating a person's personal public service number. The inclusion of the parents' PPS numbers is designed to facilitate the parents or parent acting on behalf of the child in dealing with public service agencies. The above requirements apply equally in the case of marital and non-marital births when registering her child's birth. Thus a single mother is required to furnish details of her own PPS number and that of the father, where his details are being included in the register.</P>
