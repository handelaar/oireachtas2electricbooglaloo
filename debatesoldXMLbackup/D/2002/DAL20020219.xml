    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The key areas for which my Department is responsible in terms of implementation of An Action Programme for the Millennium can be broadly summarised as follows: supporting the development and implementation of policy in a co-ordinated way across Departments, including servicing the activities of the Cabinet committees; working with the British Government and the pro-Agreement parties to achieve the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects; taking a lead role in respect of Civil Service modernisation, including regulatory reform; and supports for the social partnership process, including the NESC, NESF and the NCPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my Department takes a lead role <Col N="1110" /> in the development of the information society. This is focused on realising the potential of information and communication technologies &ndash; ICTs &ndash; across all areas of economic and social activity.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area of law reform and the law offices, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution was re-established and has produced six progress reports to date. A review group reported in June 1999 on the reorganisation of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. As a result, the formal transfer of responsibility for criminal prosecution work has transferred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions with effect from 3 December 2001. The transfer of responsibility for the State solicitor service, which will require legislation, is currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>Progress under these various headings is reported to the House by Ministers with direct functional responsibility for areas which are facilitated by the co-ordinating work of my Department. For example, in the context of public service modernisation, progress in this area has included: two iterations of strategy statements by Departments and offices; development and adoption of principles of quality customer service; publication of customer action plans by Departments and offices; publication of the OECD report on regulatory reform; introduction of a performance management and development system; and a new gender equality policy for the Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of supplementary questions arise from the Taoiseach's reply. He said his Department has a co-ordinating role in bringing together the various strands that make up An Action Programme for the Millennium. Will he describe in detail the co-ordination that went into achieving the sixth objective of the action programme, as published on 11 October 2000, which was &ldquo;to provide affordable housing for our population and to ease the transport and other infrastructural bottlenecks through a major public investment programme, including public private partnerships&ldquo;? It is more than two years since that objective was outlined. Will the Taoiseach outline the type of co-ordination he has provided in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I chair a cross-departmental committee on infrastructure and public private partnerships. It is serviced by officials from my Department who work with various other Departments in a co-ordinating role. At times, public agencies are also involved in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the objective of providing affordable accommodation, does the Taoiseach consider the failure of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to publish legislation on the private rented sector to be the result of poor co-ordination? What is his explanation for such a clear measure not being brought forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1111" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for affordable social housing last year was 5,000 which was 1,000 more than the target set by the Department's guidelines. As its excellent report demonstrates, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has continued that work. A few weeks ago in a reply to Deputy Gilmore, I reported that the heads of the Bill have been produced and that legislation is being drafted to deal with the issue. That, however, is a matter for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>A young constituent of mine is in a coma in Cork University Hospital after being beaten unconscious on the streets of Cork. He is in the same hospital as a young Cork man who was beaten unconscious two weeks previously. Three nights ago, a young man was found unconscious in Eccles Street, Dublin, after being beaten unconscious. What co-ordination is the Taoiseach undertaking to ensure that the many commitments made on crime, encapsulated by the commitment that there would be zero tolerance of all crime, are fulfilled? What is the Taoiseach doing to keep the streets safe and to allay the fears of many parents who are afraid to let their teenage children go down town? What is he doing to allay the fears of the many young working people and students whose lives, particularly their social lives, are being destroyed every weekend by acts of random violence perpetrated by people who seem to be sure they will get away with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with those issues every day. We do not have a separate committee dealing with them. Crimes will still be committed, even with a 27% decrease in the crime rate, 1,200 extra gardaí, an end to the revolving-door prison system and tougher legislation. Eccles Street is in my constituency and that was not the only such event to occur recently in the capital. I am glad to say that by and large the streets were far worse 15 years ago when drug use was rampant and before many of the drugs initiatives were in place. The Minister is bringing in a public order Bill to deal with what was referred to by Deputy Noonan, namely, that there still are people who at night randomly attack, assault, injure and maim young people. It is a feature of modern society towards which the legislation is directed and I think everyone in the House will support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the recent household surveys have shown that less than one crime in four is now reported? Is he aware that there is a particular problem among young men in reporting crimes where they have been assaulted, associated with feelings of self-worth and inadequacy? Is the Taoiseach further aware that there is an absolutely total mismatch between the incidents of street assault recorded at the main accident and emergency hospitals and those recorded in Garda stations? Will he treat this matter seriously in the dying days of the five-<Col N="1112" /> year Government? Will he take his Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform aside and tell him to stop the hypocrisy and make the streets safe once more, because they are not safe at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the picture painted by Deputy Noonan is a picture of the cities that I know, including his own city. Figures have fallen by an unprecedented 27%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>They are August statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they accurate figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures are at a 20-year low. I do not think there is any change in the attitude to recorded crime. Of course crime exists and there are still attacks taking place, particularly at night at weekends. The situation in the city centre was probably worse in the mid-1980s when the drugs issue began. At that time there were no special units and no deputy commissioner with responsibility for the co-ordination of those special units as are in existence now. Many of the people involved in crime are being caught and it would be wrong to give the impression that the people involved in these random attacks are not caught; many of them are before the courts daily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium progress report for September 2001 boasts that the Government has what it describes as the most ambitious decentralisation programme in the history of the State. The reality is that in the regions, and certainly in the region I represent, we have no evidence of such a programme being implemented. County Monaghan in particular has not had a single section of a Department decentralised since the establishment of the State. I ask the Taoiseach to what programme is this report of September 2001 referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Ó Caoláin puts down a question to the Minister for Finance who is the Minister responsible. This Government has been committed to continuing the programme of decentralisation. Long and arduous discussions with the trade unions and the staff associations have just been completed. We have spent a considerable amount of time trying to agree terms acceptable to the public service workers in order to gain their support for the decentralisation programmes. About 120 or 130 towns have made their case for inclusion in the programme and I am sure Monaghan has done so. The Minister has a committee working on the decentralisation proposal and he has made it clear that he is not going to make any announcements before a general election because it would bring the system into disrepute and would upset the progress made with the staff associations on this matter. Whoever is the Minister for Finance in the next Government will find the work has <Col N="1113" /> been done to enable the programme to be implemented very quickly with the agreement of the staff associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach suggests I submit a question to the Minister for Finance. I did so in October 2000 to which he replied that consultations were ongoing and decisions would be made by the end of that year. What decisions have been made? Is it not the case that the Government has lost a golden opportunity not only to address the needs of the regions but also to address the needs of this hard pressed and over-stretched city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the city is over-stretched. There is a commitment and now an agreement with the staff side that, ultimately, a considerable number of thousands of public servants will be moved with their agreement. That process had to be negotiated. It is one thing to announce what will happen but more difficult to agree on a process by which it will be done.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago I was involved in the largest decentralisation programme to date involving the movement of staff from the Inland Revenue, the Department of Social Welfare and elsewhere to towns and cities. There must be agreement with the staff side and I believe that is now in place. A committee has considered which areas will be transferred but no final decisions have been made because, as the Minister has made clear, announcements should not be made during a general election campaign.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Does the Taoiseach agree that at the outset of the new millennium it is very sad that a coalition of groups representing people with disabilities are obliged to come together to demand the most basic rights for disabled people? Does he agree that any action programme for the millennium should have incorporated, as a fundamental right, physical access to education and other services rather than allowing the various institutions of State to make decisions on whether such rights should be granted? Will he indicate if the Government is committed to taking on board the points being made by those championing the rights of the disabled, including the withdrawal of the Disability Bill until it is suitably amended and to give a new impetus to projects that would make the country, in all its aspects and institutions, accessible to those who now suffer from various forms of disability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, has on numerous occasions reported to the House on the progress she has made. I am sure the Deputy will agree that in view of the Equal Status Act, the Employment Equality Act and many other measures, she has probably done more in this area than any of her predecessors. In addition, significantly greater <Col N="1114" /> resources have been allocated to disability services.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is committed to working with disability groups and lobbies on the Disability Bill. Like other Ministers and members of the Opposition, I have listened to the concerns of many of these groups, especially regarding section 47 of the Bill, and their ideas on how the Bill should be amended. The Minister of State is in consultation with them in an effort to resolve these issues. She is anxious to ensure that this, the fifth or sixth Bill she has dealt with in this area, is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Action Programme for the Millennium stated the Government's commitment to ensuring that disability is placed where it belongs, on the agenda of each Department and public body. When the programme was updated in 1999, the Government promised to develop a comprehensive disability strategy, yet, as Deputy Higgins pointed out, after five years, in the dying days of the Government, and for the first time ever the nine principal organisations which look after the interests of the disabled are meeting tonight in the Mansion House to protest against the Government's inactivity and demand the withdrawal of the derisory Disability Bill which does not meet their needs. How can the Taoiseach stand over this after five years? What type of situation has he allowed develop after all these commitments that the most vulnerable groups in society are left in the lurch by his Administration and he does have the time to mend his hand and put in place what they demand? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the list of projects proposed, the Taoiseach stated proper resources would be provided for people with a disability. The list was published in October 2000. How can the Taoiseach explain his failure to do this against the background of unprecedented wealth, on the one hand, and the manifest dissatisfaction, on the other, of the group of nine, to which Deputy Noonan referred and which are in conflict with the hapless Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, who has lost trust with the people for whom she has so-called responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall where the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and the Government picked it up, the Bills which were struck down and could not be operated after the then President had referred them to the courts. That was the mess we were in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>That was amended under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thankfully, we now have the Equal Status Act, the Employment Equality Act and other Bills. As Deputy Noonan said, local authorities, health and other agencies are working in a co-ordinated way to improve the position. That has required resources, particularly for edu<Col N="1115" /> cation. We have moved from expenditure of &euro;7 million to &euro;70 million per annum in the area of education for those with a disability. In the residential area, for the first time in 30 years the waiting list has been reduced. Admittedly, this will have to continue for the next ten years. It built up leaving many elderly persons with people with medical, sensory and other forms of disability. Resources will continue to be required. We have allocated further resources to the services end. This year alone, for those with an intellectual disability and autism, an additional &euro;50 million has been provided and for those with physical and sensory disabilities we have allocated further revenue and capital of almost &euro;40 million.</P>
      <P>In the case of legislation, I know the point the groups are making. They state section 47, as they see it, is an obstacle. Their views are being listened to by the Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard what they stated. They want to ensure compliance. They believe most of the measures brought forward in the legislation are excellent, but want to ensure they are put in place. To this end they are looking for a compliance regime. The Minister of State is prepared to work with them to try to achieve this. Needless to say, she does not want to bring forward legislation that will not be complied with.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>She is prepared to try to address this issue and work with the group. She has been extremely hard-working. It is unfair of any Member to say otherwise, but there is a difference on this issue which she is trying to resolve. I have never seen anybody so dedicated both in government and opposition in working with people with a disability. I am sure the groups concerned appreciate this. They differ on the legislation, which is the not the first Bill to which amendments have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the start of Question Time we have established that the able bodied are afraid to walk the streets and the disabled are left with no other course of action but to come together tonight to protest against the inactivity of the Government. After five years in office, this is deplorable. I turn to the commitments made in the Government's programme on housing. Assuming it was safe enough for a person to walk the streets, he or she would see large numbers of homeless people destitute in doorways around this city, yet the Government promised to increase the number of houses. Does the Taoiseach agree the number of houses being built <Col N="1116" /> declined by 6% last year and that the reason the clinics of every Member of the House and every councillor, regardless of political persuasion, are full of people looking for local authority houses is that their only chance of receiving a home is to be housed by the local authorities? What are the Taoiseach's plans, in the final few weeks of his dying administration, to ensure sufficient numbers of local authority houses are built to house the homeless people who have been crowding our advice clinics for the past 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question by Deputy Quinn, the Taoiseach claimed that 5,000 new local authority dwellings were built last year, a figure he claimed was 1,000 ahead of the target set by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Given that the target for last year provided for in the PPF was about 6,500 local authority houses, when did the Department set a target of 4,000 local authority dwellings? Were the Government and the Department operating to a different target from the one agreed among the social partners in the PPF? </P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government took office, hardly an autistic child had a special teacher. There are now hundreds of special teachers for autistic children. While it is uncomfortable for the Deputy to hear this, it is, nevertheless, true. An enormous amount of resources has been put into this area.</P>
      <P>We have taken radical steps on housing, including new legislation. When we took office, house prices were spiralling out of control and rising at an annual rate of 40%. There were no proposals to deal with this in the programme of the rainbow Government. Increases in house prices have eased dramatically from 40% in 1998 to under 6% now. Last year more than 51,000 new houses were built, the highest figure ever and the fifth consecutive year of record housing output under this Government. It is also 50% above the highest level of output achieved under the rainbow Government, which was 33,700 completions in 1996. Last year &euro;1,707 million was spent on housing, three and a half times the &euro;507 million spent in the year the rainbow Government left office. The increase in supply and easing of prices were brought about by well timed and successful initiatives taken by the Government, which I am sure the Deputies will welcome on behalf of their constituents.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, they have been on the list for a considerable period of time. Despite the fact that the House sat four days a week and late nights, it did not get time to deal with this legislation. Both Bills are important, perhaps the most important on the legislative programme, but they are not holding up many issues. The work on the Statute Book has continued, a matter on which I have reported to the House on many occasions. The purpose of the Interpretation Bill is to simplify the reading of statute law by deleting large amounts of standard principles of interpretation. This is important to a certain section, but perhaps not a priority against the type of legislation that has been on the list. There was a delay in regard to the other Bill to allow the proposals of the NCCP to be taken into account. That is now ongoing. I understand there is some urgency in regard to the Bill.</P>

        <b>: </b>Can I ask the Taoiseach if he or his Department has made an effort to curb the fees demanded by legal advocates who have worked at the Moriarty tribunal and other inquiries, in order to save taxpayers' money? The Taoiseach was quite brutal in his dealings with secondary teachers who sought what many people considered to be a quite justifiable pay rise, given the difficult job they do. Can the Taoiseach confirm that sections of the legal profession can nominate any fees they wish and that neither he nor his Department has opposed this? What has the Taoiseach to say about the apparent possibility for sections of the legal profession to name any amount they wish and to get it without any objection? Does he think this is a rip-off of the taxpayer who funds these inquiries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The setting of fees for counsel is a matter for the Office of the Attorney General. There are strict Department of Finance guidelines for this area which the Attorney General follows. It is not the case that anyone can get anything. There is a procedure for certifying counsel fees. An invoice would first have to be cleared by the eminent judge of the relevant tribunal. One cannot lodge any claim willy-nilly as there are strict guidelines. On the other hand, if counsels wish to improve their positions there is a process whereby they have to put their case in train for increased fees. There is a process.</P>

        <b>: </b>I was going to be brief. Given that the Attorney General, or attorneys general, are part of the legal establish<Col N="1122" /> ment, does this situation not smack of the legal establishment looking after itself? Why do we not have an independent monitoring body to set fees which is reasonable from the point of view of taxpayers, rather than people being allowed to name any fee they want and the Taoiseach going along with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not listening to me. The fees are set and negotiated by the Department of Finance. If someone wishes to change the position it is for the Department of Finance to do so. The new fee is initially certified by the relevant judge &ndash; in this case Mr. Justice Moriarty. The tribunal registrar then certifies the fee and passes it to the finance unit in the relevant Department. The Attorney General also certifies the fee which is based on the fees which are set out. The Attorney General is certifying what has been negotiated and what is fulfilling the Department of Finance's directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Finance, does the Taoiseach share my experience that there is no negotiation regarding fees and that, in effect, the Attorney General comes into the office of the Minister for Finance and says, &ldquo;This is the amount of money we have to pay&rdquo;? Deputy Higgins alluded to the fact that, in effect, this is squared down in the Law Library.</P>
      <P>In light of the fortunes which have been made recently, does the Taoiseach agree that perhaps we should start to apply the same tendering procedures to legal fees which apply in all Departments regarding consultants whereby people would be invited to submit bids which could be subjected to some kind of external scrutiny? In light of the extraordinary costs and the fact that we are carrying &euro;1.27 million on account for two people who may or may not lodge claims, does the Taoiseach further agree that it is time the Competition Authority was asked to look at the manner in which fees are set? The current situation comprises a triangle between a judge who, in most cases, is a former senior counsel, an Attorney General, who usually has to be a senior counsel, and current senior counsels, three of whom square off and decide the rate of pay on a <i>per diem</i> basis. Does the Taoiseach agree that there is no tendering process for this extraordinary level of remuneration in contrast to the provision of professional services under tender in every other sphere of Government activity?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some truth in the Deputy's comments and I know the procedure. However, the Deputy knows that the situation is not that easy in cases involving the State. There is no negotiation, but that is because the market can pay a higher rate than Departments. The situation has not changed in the 15 years I have been observing it. There is a rate set by the Department of Finance which has to be followed.</P>

The Deputy knows the Department of Finance fights as hard in terms of the overall fees because in all of these inquiries and investigations there tends to be a longer period and a shorter period and the costs mount. This has always been the case, no matter which tribunal or funding issue is involved. However, in many cases the Department and the Attorney General, who are trying to negotiate the counsel, have experienced difficulties in getting the people the Government wants, even at those rates. It is not the case that people are queuing up. This happens all the time and it makes the whole thing quite difficult.</P>

It is evident that there is no incentive for them to finish in any great hurry.

      <Quest>if he has received a report from the Central Bank on the reported loss of $750 million in a subsidiary of AIB; if so, the findings of the report; and if he is undertaking an investigation of the Central Bank in order to establish its role in the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the Central Bank became aware of what had happened, contact was made with the US Federal Reserve, the primary regulator of Allfirst's activities. As the consolidated regulator for the AIB Group, the Central Bank has supervisory oversight of Allfirst. However, primary regulatory <Col N="1125" /> responsibility lies with the Federal Reserve. Two officers of the Central Bank travelled to the headquarters of Allfirst and they have been working with officers of the Federal Reserve to confirm the scale of losses and to identify as far as they can how these losses were accumulated and why procedures failed to identify a serious problem in good time. These inquires are ongoing.</P>
      <P>When their current investigation has been completed, the Central Bank will prepare a report for me on whether any changes to legislative provisions governing banking supervision may be required in the light of recent events. I should explain that the Central Bank is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions. National legislation dealing with the prudential regulation of credit institutions, which is largely derived from EU directives, obliges the Central Bank to treat as confidential the information it holds on supervised entities.</P>
      <P>The legislation is framed so as to preserve the confidentiality of a bank's commercial interests and customer relations. It provides a protection for privacy, balancing the very wide range of inquiry which the Central Bank must have to carry out its supervisory role. There are provisions which enable the Central Bank to share confidential information with other bodies with similar functions subject to stringent conditions of professional secrecy.</P>
      <P>It follows from what I have just outlined that there is no specific legal right of a Minister for Finance to information held by the Central Bank on individual supervised entities. I may, however, under the Central Bank Act, 1998 consult with the bank, in general terms, on regulatory issues. In this case, I have asked the Central Bank to report to me on the legislative arrangements in place and on the lessons to be learnt in that regard. The bank has confirmed to me that it will produce such a report.</P>
      <P>International banking supervision is very complex, and many subsidiary entities are regulated at different levels and in different countries from their parent companies. A very wide network of co-operative working arrangements exists between regulators. In this case, the Central Bank was not the principal regulator of the supervised entity, but did regulate the overall prudential position of the group concerned. Events have shown that the prudential and solvency position of the group is more than sufficient to weather the strain. I know the Central Bank is anxious to learn from these events.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that we have a massive failure yet again in AIB and the Central Bank? We have a failure of internal controls and management information systems, a failure of internal and external audit and particularly a failure of the supervisory authority, the Central Bank. Does the Minister accept that there is a worrying trend developing? The Central Bank knew nothing and did nothing about ICI, the evasion of DIRT or about the problem <Col N="1126" /> in Allfirst until it was informed by the AIB itself. Are alarm bells not ringing in the Department of Finance about the performance of the Central Bank?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in reply to priority questions, the primary regulator in this regard was the Federal Reserve of the United States. The same regulations apply in this country. The banks that operate here are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland and it has the primary role in relation to their operations here. In the last 15 years there has been a large increase in the number of banks and financial institutions operating here. In the US the Federal Reserve is the banking supervisory authority for operations within its remit. There is a residuary role for the Central Bank of Ireland as it is the potential regulator of the AIB Group but primary responsibility for the issue lies with the Federal Reserve. It is not correct to try to link the three issues. The US has cause to be proud of the Federal Reserve yet I am sure one would find lapses in this area in its operation. People here seem anxious to pin blame at all costs on the Central Bank and that criticism is unfair.</P>

      <P>I am not in that category but I was appalled by the evidence given by the Governor of the Central Bank and his predecessor. It showed me, as chairman of the DIRT inquiry, an enormous gap in the Central Bank and it has now manifested itself again. Does the Minister agree there is something amiss when only one bank group has such a series of events? Does he agree that now is the time to ask questions about the supervisory role of the Central Bank in relation to the AIB and to ask for heads in the AIB?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Central Bank of Ireland and the Federal Reserve of the United States will be interested in the outcome of the report being prepared by the AIB's investigators, the investigations by the management of the AIB Group, those being carried out by the Federal Reserve, those of the FBI and whatever investigations are carried out by the Central Bank of Ireland. Everybody will learn something from that process, not least the management of AIB Group. AIB will have to answer to its shareholders and to the various regulatory authorities. The various bodies will take on board whatever lessons have to be learned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>In the mid-1980s when the AIB Group had difficulties with the Insurance Corpor<Col N="1127" /> ation of Ireland the Government of the day deemed it of sufficient magnitude that it could be a danger to the banking business of the State. That is why that Government took the decision it did regarding that particular collapse. The situation is different today. Despite this substantial loss by AIB Group on its Allfirst operation in the US, the effect on the reserves of the AIB Group are not significant. The adequacy of its tier one and two capital ratios are way above the minimum requirement. If the group had suffered such a loss in the 1980s the situation would be different but such is the strength of the AIB Group that it is able to take the strain.</P>

      <Quest>the number of High Court orders sought by the Revenue Commissioners under the Finance Act, 1999 to require financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information regarding holders of bogus accounts; the number of cases where orders have been granted; the progress made in identifying the holders of such accounts who did not avail of the recent voluntary disclosure scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5871/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, as provided for by the Finance Act, 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders will be the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>Eight applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 11 financial institutions. One other application is pending. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that work is currently progressing in relation to other financial institutions and that further applications to the High Court will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>Work has already commenced as regards taxpayers who held bogus non-resident accounts which were detected in the course of the DIRT look-back audits of financial institutions in 1999 and 2000 and did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001. Revenue expects that information under court orders will become available on a phased basis commencing shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long <Col N="1128" /> programme of investigations over a number of years, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that significant progress is being made in this new phase of the investigations. Deputies will recall that the earlier voluntary disclosure phase resulted in receipts of £179 million, &euro;227 million, for the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that the so-called voluntary disclosure depended on a carrot and stick effect, the carrot being the remission of a certain amount of the penalties involved and the stick involving prosecution or investigation by the Revenue. Does the Minister have any reason to revisit the guestimate of the Revenue Commissioners, that there might be 25,000 bogus accounts? Can he give any indication of the results so far of the applications made to court or whether any information has become available from the institutions concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 25,000 was given during the course of the DIRT inquiry and it resulted from a memo prepared by an officer. All Revenue applications for High Court orders will have been made by 21 March this year. Work has begun on an initial list of over 800 account holders identified from accounts detected during the DIRT audit, the process Revenue conducted with the banks over time. Since the scheme of voluntary disclosure ceased Revenue has been making applications to the High Court under the powers I gave in the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>This is a big undertaking. What will be done in the first phase will be to match bogus non-resident accounts with people who availed of either the 1993 amnesty or the subsequent voluntary disclosure scheme of 2001. That will take considerable time. There are a large number of staff in the Revenue Commissioners working on this. As settlements are made, they will be published in the quarterly returns made by the Revenue Commissioners, if the limits are exceeded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does any difficulty arise for the Revenue Commissioners in comparing the information it receives from these returns with the earlier amnesty in 1993 given that that amnesty was carried out on condition that anybody receiving a certificate would be guaranteed secrecy thereafter? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware at this stage of any particular difficulties and doubt if any will arise. If, under the powers of the 1999 Act and court orders, Revenue found and wrote to such a person, whom we may call Mr. A, it would be in his interests to produce for the Revenue Commissioners the certificate from the 1993 amnesty which &ldquo;amnestises&rdquo; that particular account. It would be in the taxpayer's interest to produce the evidence. That is what has been happening in recent years. Cases have come to light where the Revenue Commissioners, on foot of normal investigations regarding back duty, have come <Col N="1129" /> across persons who said their accounts were &ldquo;amnestised&rdquo; under the 1993 legislation. However, I am not aware of any further difficulties, nor do I anticipate any, because it is in the taxpayer's interests to produce the certificate he or she obtained under the 1993 amnesty, or the voluntary disclosure scheme of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does a difficulty arise where somebody made a partial but incomplete disclosure in 1993, where he or she declared part but not all of his or her liability? If one goes back to that person now, he or she can claim that he or she has his or her certificate which debars Revenue from looking at the account or amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy is talking about the 15% incentive amnesty, which certificate covered a person's total reported earnings and where he or she had to pay a certain amount. He or she would have to prove in 2002 that the amount he or she &ldquo;amnestised&rdquo; in 1993 covered the full total, including the amount of the undisclosed bogus non-resident account. The Revenue Commissioners would carry out a normal back duty audit investigation of, for example, Mr. A, whereby they would go over his dealings for a number of years. When it came to a final settlement, he would say he &ldquo;amnestised&rdquo; certain amounts under the 1993 amnesty. If a person took advantage of the 1993 amnesty but did not declare or &ldquo;amnestise&rdquo;, if that is the appropriate word, a bogus non-resident account, he or she is in breach of the 1993 amnesty and will have difficulties under the voluntary disclosure scheme of 2001 also. He or she will not get off the hook in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>At budget time the forecast for the 2002 Exchequer balance was for a surplus of &euro;170 million. This remains unchanged from the budget. Forecasts for the public finances are predicated on the level of activity in the economy. On budget day an increase of 3.9% in gross domestic product in 2002 was forecast. Nothing so far would lead me to change this view which is reasonable given the current economic climate.</P>
      <P>The increase in tax receipts in 2002 over 2001 was forecast at budget time to be 8.6%. The January Exchequer returns showed that tax receipts in January were disappointing in that they were lower than receipts in January 2001. However, it is important to note that this is not necessarily an indicator of the trend for the year as a whole and it is not appropriate to extrapolate an estimate for the remainder of the year on this basis. In addition, in 2002, a significant element of the tax changes announced in the budget, in the case of VAT and corporation tax, will not take effect until later in the year. The standard rate of VAT will increase from 20% to 21% in March this year and the impact of this increase should be evident from the May receipts onwards. The changes in the corporation tax payment dates will be evident in receipts from June 2002 onwards.</P>
      <P>As with tax receipts, it is difficult to draw conclusions for the year from one month's spending increase. In fact, in the case of voted current expenditure, January spending was 7.4% of the annual estimate which is less than one twelfth of spending for the year as a whole. As the year advances, it is likely that the emerging position in some areas will improve while in others there will be a disimprovement. This is characteristic of the normal activity in the headings which comprise the Exchequer balance depending also on the pattern of economic growth during the year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Exchequer returns are analysed in detail on a quarterly basis throughout the year. An assessment of quarterly trends provides a better basis for examining emerging trends and comparing them with previous years and existing forecasts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners keep a profile of expenditure. When the quarterly <Col N="1131" /> returns are announced the data at that particular time give under each heading the figure for a particular item as against the Revenue profile. The Revenue Commissioners do this on a quarterly basis and a press conference is held at which journalists ask questions about the various areas of interest to them.</P>
      <P>There has been some comment about the January figures. I will point something out to the Deputy about the Revenue side. It would be foolish to take the month of January as an indicator for the whole year. In January 2001 receipts were 19% over those of January 2000. However, the receipts for 2001 were down to a far lower level. If one had extrapolated from the January 2001 figures, the Exchequer surplus for 2001 should have been enormous, but it was not. It is incorrect to base assumptions on one month's figures.</P>
      <P>There are technical reasons the figures for January 2002 were not up to the level of 2001, of which one was that January 2001 showed an enormous increase on the previous January. I have already referred to the question of VAT and corporation tax which were attacked later in the year. The change in the short tax year means that P35s, which would normally have been received in April &ndash; the end of the tax year for all employees &ndash; will be received in February. There was a tendency during the years that people would group their monthly accounts with their P35 at the end of the tax year and send them in. The P30, which gives the monthly figure for PAYE, would only have operated from 6 to 31 December.</P>
      <P>Because of these factors, I would not like too much to be read into the figures for January 2002. A better trend will emerge when the quarterly figures are announced in March. This should be borne in mind.</P>

Against this, there are receipts under every tax heading and figures for what Revenue would have expected under each heading. The <Col N="1132" /> estimation of receipts under the various headings is done independently of the Minister for Finance. It is done in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and officers of my Department before the budget each year. I have no hand, act or part in it.</P>

The Minister is ultimately responsible. I will go back to my question &ndash; I do not why the Minister is evading it. What do the monthly projections of the Department state about what should have been the outturn for revenue and expenditure for January? How do they compare to the actual outturn?

      <Quest>if, before appointing a new Governor of the Central Bank, he considered a possible nominee from outside the Department of Finance; his views on whether the habit of transferring senior Department of Finance personnel to the governorship of the Central Bank blurs the lines of independence and demarcation between the two; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5755/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Central Bank Act, 1942, the Governor of the Central Bank is appointed by the President on the advice of the Government for a term of seven years. The current Governor, Mr. Maurice O'Connell, informed me of his intention to retire with effect from 10 March 2002. Following this, on 30 January the Government considered a range of possible candidates to succeed Mr. O'Connell and, in the event, decided to request the President to appoint Mr. John Hurley, current Secretary General of the Department of Finance, as Governor of the Central Bank with effect from 11 March 2002.</P>
      <P>The Government's deliberations in this matter are confidential and I do not propose to say which other candidates, apart from Mr. Hurley, were considered for appointment. It is true that the post of Governor has traditionally been held by former officials of the Department of Finance. It will be agreed that the country has been well served by these individuals who, in their terms as Governor, have contributed to the high reputation the Central Bank enjoys at home and abroad, especially as a regulatory authority in the financial services area.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the post is held by a person of integrity with a proven track record of good management and interpersonal skills, familiarity with the area and with the intellectual capacity to serve, <i>ex officio</i>, as a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank. Viewed in this context, it can be readily appreciated that the post of Secretary General of the Department of Finance is an excellent and appropriate background for a Governor to possess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of independence, the governorship of the Central Bank is protected at a number of different levels by a legal framework that ensures independence. This independence is <Col N="1134" /> traditionally jealously guarded by Governors and protected by the Maastricht Treaty. The Government must also, in appointing a governor, take full account of the potential appointees and their personal ability to assert that independence. Clearly, the Government is happy with its decision in the current case. Future cases are a matter for future Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question does not impugn the proposed appointee, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, who is an eminent public servant. The issue is the principle involved. The Committee of Public Accounts, in its DIRT inquiry, found the Central Bank severely wanting. It found that there was no independent thinking in the Central Bank or in the Revenue Commissioners as distinct from the Department of Finance. It found that there was a cosy relationship which led all people to think the same and to come to the wrong conclusions together.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister, therefore, agree that it would be much better in order to encourage independence of thinking to provide for critical analysis of the Department of Finance's policy by having a Governor of the Central Bank who is not only independent in name, but independent in thought? Somewhere other than the Department of Finance should be sought as a source for Governors of the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a slur on the current Governor and on previous Governors of the Central Bank to impugn that they do not have independence of thought. That is what the Deputy said and it casts a slur on the current Governor and past Governors, something the Deputy said he would not do. Over the past four and a half years &ndash; I would say I speak for my predecessors as well &ndash; we often hoped that the Central Bank annual review or quarterly review would happily coincide with the views of the Minister and the Department of Finance, but, in my time and in previous times, I have not yet seen a comment by a Governor of the Central Bank or one in the report of the Central Bank that was not critical in large or small measure of what the Minister for Finance and the Government of the day was doing. In all those reports, the Central Bank exercised its independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the Department of Finance in particular are responsible for setting out the regulatory and legislative framework within which the Central Bank operates. However, governors of central banks here and abroad have acted independently of the Irish Department of Finance and Departments of Finance in other countries. From my experience in Europe, the Central Bank operates much more independently than most other central banks in Europe which operate independently. It is wrong to think that the Central Bank of Ireland does not operate independently of the Department of Finance or anybody else. Its independence is jealously guarded. The Governor is appointed for a seven <Col N="1135" /> year term and only in very unusual circumstances can a Governor of the Central Bank be removed. It has never occurred here and it ensures the independence of the Governor.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for future Governments to decide who they wish to make Governors of the Central Bank, but, as far as I am concerned, the people who have served as Governors of the Central Bank, having served in the Department of Finance, have done an excellent job. If the Deputy does not believe me, he should consult former Ministers for Finance in his party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not surprising that former Ministers for Finance would say that having appointed previous Governors. There is an incestuous relationship between three major financial organs of this State &ndash; the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance &ndash; or that certainly was the case until the DIRT inquiry. A specific point made by the DIRT inquiry is being ignored. The old pals act where the Secretary General or a very senior assistant Secretary General of the Department of Finance is promoted to the Central Bank is not good enough. Deficiencies in the Central Bank over the past number of years have been shown to exist and I am very disappointed and surprised that the Minister seems happy with the whole show.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of plans for a new programme of decentralisation involves a very considerable amount of work. To date, consultations have taken place with Civil Service management as well as with the public service unions. My Department has also received submissions, representations and inquiries from or on behalf of over 100 urban centres throughout the country. The results of these consultations as well as the submissions, etc, will help to inform the Government's decision in relation to the new programme. I have consistently said that decisions will be taken only after appropriate deliberation and I am not prepared to move from that position.</P>
      <P>A new and significant programme of decentralisation will have implications not only for the people involved, but also for the way in which our public administration operates. I am concerned to ensure that at no time is the efficient delivery of public services compromised. In the meantime, I am continuing to consider all the implications of a significant new programme of decentralisation and given the importance and complexity of many of the issues involved as well my commitment that decisions should be taken only after appropriate deliberation, I am not prepared at this time to commit myself definitively to a time by when such decisions should be taken.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to reflect on the Minister's responses to this question whenever it has arisen since he first initiated the policy two years ago. In the first six months or so he told us how incredibly urgent it was to get responses from colleagues and take decisions. He then marked time for about a year. For the past six months he has been telling us he is determined not to rush the process. Is it not time to face the music and tell us this is not going to happen?</P>

      <P>I would like to have completed the process of decentralisation long before now, but it sparked off such interest among Deputies, county councillors, town councillors and branch secretaries everywhere in Ireland that I have been snowed under with applications. Every Deputy in this House has put questions to me on this matter at various times. Also there has been considerable interest from the trade unions representing their members and from the management of the various Departments. I would like to have moved with considerably more speed than has proved possible. However, it is better to get the decision right than half-baked. There are well over 100 interesting and very well worked out submissions from various towns and centres throughout the country. It has, therefore, taken more time than I would have wished.</P>

      <P>Let me ask the question again, because the Minister did not respond to it. Let me, perhaps, make it a little easier for him. Is there the remotest chance of this process being <Col N="1137" /> initiated in a serious way before the dissolution of the Dáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not credible for the Minister to say he was surprised by the level of interest in this programme of decentralisation. What went wrong? The Minister gave a firm commitment two years ago that the programme would be up and running by now. Was there a veto by the Tánaiste, who put it on the record that she did not want this programme to be turned into a Fianna Fáil election gimmick? Is that what scuppered the plans? Something must have gone wrong because the Minister gave the firmest commitment to this House, to individual Deputies and to groups across the country over two years ago that the programme would be up and running by now. I appreciate that the applications must be processed, but what went wrong? Did the Minister not have any idea of how the applications could be assessed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that decentralisation should go hand in hand with a proper well thought out spatial plan? Does he agree that dealing with decentralisation on the basis of stroke politics, depending on which Minister is resident in what constituency, is no way to handle human beings who have dedicated their lives to the public service? Does he agree that, without a proper spatial plan that recognises future development centres, it is codology to pretend there is decentralisation when it is really a question of shifting people to prop up a weak Deputy or Minister in a constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take account of the national spatial strategy, which is in the course of preparation and will be published shortly. If I were to engage in what the Deputy terms stroke politics, I would have dealt with the matter in the way alluded to by Deputy Bradford, which has been, I must confess, the history of decentralisation. I have often referred to the compelling case made for County Wexford to have decentralisation to two places during the term of office of the last Government. That, of course, had nothing to with the fact that Deputies Yates and Howlin were Government Ministers at the time. I am sure there was no connection, but other people might not think that.</P>
      <P>What I did commit to was that there should not be a definitive list of criteria against which applications would be measured and if they did not meet those criteria they would be excluded. I was not prepared to rule any centre in or, more importantly, out. I gave a commitment to this House that I would not engage in stroke politics in this area because it involves people's lives and careers, and considerable benefit to the locations involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons for decentralisation <Col N="1138" /> which relate to the social partners, the locations and good planning. For those reasons I have time to deliberate. If Deputy McDowell amends the Constitution to allow me total powers in deciding everything, I might be able to do what he wants. There are many aspects to be taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 of the Finance Bill provides for the introduction of a new scheme of relief from income tax on the direct sports earnings for Irish resident sports persons involved in certain sports. The categories of sports persons that can avail of this relief are listed in Schedule 23A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which provided higher contribution limits for retirement annuity purposes. These categories are an athlete, badminton player, boxer, cyclist, footballer, golfer, jockey, motor racing driver, rugby player, squash player, swimmer and tennis player.</P>
      <P>Qualifying sports persons, whether in a professional or semi-professional capacity, will be entitled to a deduction from earnings from direct participation in their particular sport of the order of 40% for up to ten years of assessment back to and including the tax year 1990-91, provided the sports person was resident in the State in these years.</P>
      <P>Eligible income under the scheme will arise from direct participation in the sport and will not include income accruing from sponsorship, advertising or endorsements. The relief can be claimed in the year in which the sports person ceases to be permanently engaged in that sport, provided the individual is resident for tax in that year, and will be provided by way of repayment of tax.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister define &ldquo;semi-professional&rdquo;? Gaelic games are amateur sports, but it could be argued that they, and the GAA in particular, receive sponsorship which is beneficial to the sponsors. Would the Minister be willing to incorporate the various aspects of its work plan in the scheme, and could that be done at this stage? In regard to the definition of the term &ldquo;semi-professional&rdquo;, would it be possible, in today's age of sponsorship of sports which are in fact amateur, to include amateur sports under that heading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether a sports person is a professional or a semi-professional is not relevant to this tax rebate. This tax rebate will operate in the year in which a person retires. It will be paid by way of repayment of tax on gross earnings from direct participation in sport. If a Dáil Deputy is also a semi-professional soccer player <Col N="1139" /> with Shamrock Rovers, the tax rebate will not relate to his earnings from the job of Dáil Deputy. It will relate only to his gross earnings from playing league of Ireland football with Shamrock Rovers. In the year of his retirement tax will be recalculated and his entitlement to a rebate will be determined. He will pay tax each year on the same basis as everybody else, but the year in which he retires, he will be entitled to a rebate of 40% of his gross earnings from direct participation in the sport.</P>
      <P>I know there are junior clubs in our county with players competing and training as hard as county players did 25 or 30 years ago. However, this is not a grant-type scheme. This is for people who are directly participating, whose earnings relate to a particular sport and who have short earning careers. I am aware of many people in my county who had a successful three or four years in a particular sport, made a living, paid a lot of tax and are now standing around street corners of certain towns. This has always struck me as ridiculous.</P>
      <P>This measure will benefit the 98% of people who make a modest living from sport. If the GAA were to change its rules and pay players for direct participation, that could be incorporated. It is not a grant type relief, it is to recognise the short earning careers of people who get money directly from sport. It will not reimburse tax for other activities, such as endorsements, sponsorship or television appearances. It is similar to the artists' exemption relief.</P>

      <P>Like most of the brilliant ideas of various Finance Bills, from SSIAs to changes in the pensions regulations, no one made representations to me. I could outline a variety of changes I have made over the years and the geneses were always my own ideas. Many years ago when I was a member of the Opposition, greater contributions were allowed for self employed persons who made their living from sport. The Jockeys Association made the case that jockeys be allowed, as they are in Britain, to put more than 15% of net relevant earnings into pensions. The idea arose ten or 12 years ago and has been around for some time. The last Government considered doing something similar but the genesis of the idea did not involve representations made at Lansdowne Road, the Curragh, Cheltenham or the pitch and toss banks in Maynooth.</P>

Given that the Minister's Department is responsible for lottery funds, can these people not be compensated by sufficient grants through the lottery scheme to allow them to cover their costs and expenses while remaining amateurs, instead of expanding the discrepancy between semi-professionalism and elite amateurism? A person who reaches the heights of inter-county football must travel and train five days a week. County representation should be rewarded by an elite person's sports grant administered by the Department of Finance to cover costs.</P>

      <P>When I was examining the matter, I considered the idea of having the relief in the year the money was earned. I decided against it because my personal experience is that people who make a successful career in sport when they are in their 20s are inclined to fritter away that money. Deputy Barrett and I have both known people in our non-political lives who earned a lot of money in their early 20s but then through accident or injury were unable to earn more. If they had their time back when they reached 30, they would do it differently. I came up with this proposal to do it in reverse &ndash; a person pays tax in the normal way and then, when he or she has more sense, he or she appreciates it more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with the substance of this question in my reply to the priority question put down by Deputy Jim Mitchell. I have not yet received a report from the Central Bank into the events in question, on the lessons to be learned from this episode and what legislative changes, if any, might be appropriate to strengthen the regulatory system as it applies to credit institutions.</P>
      <P>So far, the Central Bank has told my Department that it has sent two officials to Baltimore head office of Allfirst Bank. These officials have been working with officers of the Federal Reserve, the primary regulator of Allfirst Bank, to confirm the scale of the losses involved, to identify how these losses were run up and why procedures failed to detect them in good time.</P>
      <P>The role of the Minister for Finance is to bring forward legislative proposals for the regulation of the financial sector. Once the necessary legislative framework is in place, day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of credit institutions is a matter for the Central Bank. The Central Bank is statutorily independent in the exercise of its supervisory and regulatory functions. When the details of the events in question are known, the Central Bank will take all appropriate action, such as, no doubt, the strengthening of internal control arrangements and closer monitoring of subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>Doubtless, AIB Bank itself will inform the public as to the outcome of its investigation. The Deputy will be aware that AIB Bank has appointed an eminent person with appropriate experience to report on what happened at Allfirst Bank.</P>

Has he had any direct contact with the management of AIB Bank and what was the nature of that contact? Will the Minister confirm <Col N="1142" /> the response given to me on the Order of Business two weeks ago by the Taoiseach, when he indicated the Bill to set up the single regulatory authority would be published but was unlikely to be taken before the dissolution of the Dáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed by the Governor of the Central Bank of the issue relating to the AIB Bank and I dealt with him. I was at a function in my county last night for AIB Bank Group at which the chief executive was present. We did not discuss this but it was referred to when we met. The event was attended by 200 other people. I have had informal contact of that nature but nothing else on the matter because it is not my responsibility and it would not be appropriate to deal directly with AIB Bank as Minister for Finance. That is a matter for the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The Bill, which is known as the Central Bank of Ireland Regulatory Authority Bill, is with the Parliamentary Counsel and is on the Whips' lists. It is hoped it will be published during this session.</P>

      <P>Unless we order our business in a very streamlined fashion, it will not be. The Bill is already over 200 pages long. It is a tome and has still not been finalised. Even if it were published, unless we changed many other Bills, it is unlikely it would be taken during this session. I hope it will be published because much time and money has been spent preparing this Bill. We engaged outside consultants and solicitors to help us and then sent it to the Parliamentary Counsel. Much money and time has been spent on the Bill which I hope to publish before the end of this session. I have invested much time in it, apart from all the negotiations that took take place in the lead up to it.</P>

      <P>The changeover to the euro was completed smoothly and efficiently and transactions during it were neither brought to my attention nor gave me cause for concern. The smooth changeover was facilitated by the extensive preparations undertaken beforehand. The extensive public awareness campaign by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and the business awareness campaign run by Forfás ensured both the public and business sector were well prepared. The frontloading of euro cash by the Central Bank to banks and the sub-frontloading of retailers ensured notes and coins were widely available for the transaction of business in euro from 1 January 2002. Starter packs of euro coins <Col N="1143" /> were put on sale to the public from 14 December 2001.</P>
      <P>The cash changeover plan, drawn up by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland in conjunction with the key changeover organisations, was implemented efficiently from 1 January. On that day accounts with financial institutions were converted to euro and ATM machines began dispensing euro notes. Some 85% were dispensing in euro by 6 p.m. Retailers who opened on that day systematically gave change in euro only or, in some cases, provided exchange facilities to enable transactions only in euro at the tills. From 2 January euro cash became even more widely available through exchange and withdrawals from financial institutions, social welfare cash payments in euro and change giving by retailers generally. By the end of the first weekend the bulk of cash transactions were taking place in euro and the changeover was virtually complete within a week. Legal tender status was withdrawn from Irish pound notes and coins at midnight on 9 February, bringing the dual circulation period to an end.</P>

      <Quest>the main features of the decision taken by the Government prior to Christmas 2001 with regard to giving powers to the Revenue Commissioners to directly initiate prosecutions for tax offences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what exactly the Deputy has in mind. As he will be aware, there are existing arrangements between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Revenue Commissioners whereby members of the DPP's staff provide on-the-ground assistance for Revenue in the course of investigations of criminal cases. Under these arrangements cases are now handled by Revenue without the involvement of the Garda which refers them directly to the DPP.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the issue of a revenue court. In its final report the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts on DIRT found &ldquo;that the case has not been made for the introduction of a Revenue Court and fiscal prosecutor.&rdquo; It recommended that &ldquo;the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General undertake a more detailed study of the benefits of a Revenue Court and fiscal prosecutor and to report to the Public Accounts Committee by 31 March 2002.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department had preliminary discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners as to how the study proposed by the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts might be undertaken. I discussed the matter with the Attorney General. Having considered it, it was decided that the Attorney General would ask the <Col N="1144" /> Law Reform Commission to undertake the study. The Government noted the position in December 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the question was to elucidate the nature of the decision made by the Government in December 2001 when, according to press reports, it was indicated that Revenue would have an in-house tax prosecutor and be given the power directly to prosecute without the need to go to the DPP, something that would obviously require legislation. Is this procedure being contemplated by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting two matters slightly confused. Since 1996, when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance, the Revenue Commissioners have operated a dedicated unit for prosecutions. It liaises with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and has done so since 1996, before I became Minister for Finance. It is working effectively, although, as Deputy Jim Mitchell pointed out, the number of prosecutions brought to court may not be at the desired level. This system has been in operation for the past five years. Before 1996 matters had to be referred separately to the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of which there were all kinds of difficulties. The sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts, under the chairmanship of Deputy Jim Mitchell, stated the question of having a fiscal prosecutor was being considered by the Department of Finance which is to report by 31 March 2002. This involves a considerable amount of research and resources. Having considered the matter and discussed it with the Attorney General, I considered that the most appropriate body to research the matter was the Law Reform Commission. We decided to refer it to the commission for its views in December 2001.</P>

      <P>No, Sir. We are protesting, Sir, at the way in which business is being managed in this House. This proposal is but one indication of the cavalier attitude of the Government. In its run to the country it will no longer be accountable to this Chamber. I have cited earlier, Sir, that this House is being denied its constitutional right to hold the Taoiseach and the Government accountable as is our obligation under the Constitution as elected Members. I ask the Tánaiste if she is a party to this sordid little arrangement that is ongoing where the Taoiseach will only answer parliamentary questions once in the first three weeks of March. Is she aware of what is going on? Has she been consulted? Can I hear directly from the Tánaiste that she is giving her political approval to this set of parliamentary arrangements that will effectively deny accountability in this Chamber?</P>

I put it to the Tánaiste that the man sitting on her left was able to inform the nation last night that this will happen. What level of discussion took place between the Government and the Referendum <Col N="1153" /> Commission and what were the considerations which led the Government and the commission to believe it was not legitimate to involve the Opposition parties in those discussions?</P>

In light of its guillotining of this legislation prior to Christmas, the Government knew clearly what was intended and when the referendum would take place. Is the debacle within the Referendum Commission the inevitable outcome of the squalid fight or phoney war between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil over the so-called national stadium at Abbotstown?

      <P>On a separate matter, the Tánaiste will be aware, as will every Member of this House, that a large public meeting will take place tonight in the Mansion House. The meeting has been called out of a sense of absolute frustration, anger and betrayal on the part of different groups who have been led up the garden path by this Administration in relation to the Disabilities Bill and who believe that not only is it inadequate legislation but it removes existing rights in legislation if implemented in its drafted form. In the light of such unprecedented opposition and the anger that is now manifest across the country, will the Tánaiste, with whatever residual power the Progressive Democrats have in this Administration, give an undertaking to the House that this Bill will not see the light of day in terms of Second Stage? She has that power, or so she boasts in relation to other matters of Government policy. In the dying days of this Administration, will the Tánaiste exercise that residual power and kill this Bill which does not deserve to live?</P>

Will the Tánaiste tell us when it is planned to order Second Stage of the Courts and Court Officers Bill? Is it intended to amend the Bill to allow for the new appointments? Will the Government give the Bill the urgency it requires due to the fact that the failure to enact it has resulted in a huge backlog of cases at High Court level?

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It affects the issue of the joint amendments in our names. I am glad the Minister has accepted this amendment proposed by the Opposition and that he has reverted to using the term Office of Tobacco Control rather than Tobacco Control Agency. The term &ldquo;agency&rdquo; gives the impression of someone who acts for another person whereas the term &ldquo;office&rdquo; gives the impression of a more independent body for example, the Office of Attorney General or the Office of Director of Traffic in Dublin Corporation. It implies the person has powers and it illustrates the real role of the office.</P>
      <P>We raised most of our concerns on Committee Stage so I will not delay on these issues throughout the debate. However, RGDATA still has concerns. The members of RGDATA feel that the fact that the Office of Tobacco Control can remove a retailer's registration for the sale of tobacco products for up to three months could have the effect of closing down some of them completely. They feel that penalty is too onerous and that punishment should only be imposed by a court and not by an administrative body or office. What does the Minister intend in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" />The RGDATA members also say that the Bill would oblige retailers to put cigarettes in closed containers below the shop counter where neither the products nor the container will be visible to the public. I raised this issue on Committee Stage when there was a suggestion that it could be done in such a way that they would be accessible but not visible. Has the Minister addressed that issue? Also, will the Minister allow retailers a valid defence in a prosecution for the sale of cigarettes to a minor? That is catered for in a later amendment. On this amendment, I am glad to join with the Minister in re-naming this office the Office of Tobacco Control instead of the Tobacco Control Agency. That strengthens the role of the office and indicates that we mean business and that this office will have power and be able to act. Accordingly, I support the approach taken by the Minister and I thank him for taking the suggestion made on Committee Stage on board.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;any form of patronage by a manufacturer or importer of a tobacco product such as the association of the name of such manufacturer or importer with any public building, part of such building, educational fund, third-level chair or any other means whatsoever,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I made a point on Committee Stage in relation to this amendment. There is an issue surrounding patronage by tobacco companies which is separate from direct sponsorship. I am disappointed that the Minister has not been able to come back with a proposal to deal with this because it is clear from his comments on Committee Stage that he felt there was a matter to be dealt with. There is something wrong in having a third level institution benefiting from funding by a tobacco company in terms of trying to ensure a concerted impact in relation to reducing the level of cigarette smoking. I am interested to hear why it was not possible for the Minister to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a look at this between Committee Stage and Report Stage. I had specifically said that I would re-examine the issue as it pertained to financial contributions to educational establishments, particularly third level colleges. I had discussions with the Parliamentary Counsel and his advice, and the strong legal advice, was that we have gone as far as we can on the patronage issue and that the comprehensive definition of sponsorship in section 36 of the Bill would effectively prohibit any form of patronage where there is any evidence of a consideration being sought or given for such patronage. In other words, if a tobacco company gave funding for the chair of a particular faculty, the chair could not <Col N="1174" /> be named after that company and no advertising could be secured for that company as a result.</P>
      <P>I received further advice that there would be difficulty in terms of trying to impose particular obligations on universities on the grounds that they are independent, in essence. That was fought some years ago, but we have no right to interfere with their freedom to accept gifts from whoever they wish provided that they do not act in a manner that is at variance with the object of the university or college, or that is inconsistent with its functions. On public health grounds, we can ban patronage and sponsorship but there might be constitutional difficulties in trying to ban an individual who wanted to give money to a university without receiving anything in return, that person being connected to the tobacco industry, from doing so. However, we can ban any consideration being given to a tobacco company in response to, or as a result of, the sponsorship or patronage that the company may have offered to a college or university.</P>
      <P>On those grounds, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment even though I find it absolutely reprehensible that any university would entertain any form of funding from a tobacco company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw the amendment because of what the Minister has said but I suggest that he transmits those views to the universities. He should make it clear that, while we respect their independence, we feel that they have a duty as third level educational establishments to be part of what has to be an integrated effort to reduce the level of cigarette smoking, and to reduce the power and influence of cigarette companies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;specialist tobacconist' means a retail outlet specialising wholly or mainly in the sale of tobacco products other than cigarettes;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I proposed this amendment on Committee Stage because I was concerned about specialist shops that normally provide cigars and do so on a basis that is totally different to the sale of cigarettes. The proposal from the Minister provides for certification and perhaps the Minister will explain the basis for this. It seems to deal with the issues I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I agreed to consider the position regarding specialist cigar tobacco shops on the understanding that there were one or two in the country and that the provisions regarding tobacco advertising would put them out of business. We are talking about a type of tobacco outlet that specialises in expensive cigars and tobacco products only, and caters for a clientele on average aged 30 and upwards. In that regard, I have put forward amendment No. 197<i>a</i> which would give the Minister of the day <Col N="1176" /> enabling powers to allow such establishments to be&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister read the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, after I explain this. It would allow such establishments to be excluded from the Bill on an individual application basis. The matter was discussed further with the parliamentary counsel who has drafted an amendment which will allow the Minister to grant a certificate exempting persons who are engaged wholly in the business of selling tobacco products. The new section provides that the Minister may make regulations regarding the size and nature of the premises concerned, the type of tobacco products sold, the information to be supplied by the applicant, payment of fees to defray expenses and the period for which the exemption may be enforced.</P>
      <P>The amendment states that: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;44.&ndash;(1) This section shall apply to a person who carries on in whole the business of selling&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;tobacco products, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;products used for the purposes of or in connection with smoking, by retail, other than a person who carries on in whole such business being a subsidiary of a company that does not carry on in whole such business.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister may issue a certificate to a person to whom this section applies, upon application being made in that behalf by that person, stating that section 43 shall not apply to him or her in respect of such premises as are specified in the certificate, and accordingly, where the Minister issues such a certificate, section 43 shall not apply to the person in relation to those premises while such certificate remains in force.</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister shall not issue a certificate where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;the person making the application concerned is in contravention of regulations   under this section,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;there is a contravention of such regulations in respect of the premises to which the application concerned relates.</P>
      <P>(4) The Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this section, and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, such regulations may provide&mdash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;for the minimum size of premises to which a certificate under this section  shall apply,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;that such premises shall not form part of another premises in which products other than those referred to in<i> subsection (1)</i> are sold,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" />(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;for the proportion of tobacco products that may be sold in the form of cigarettes on those premises,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp;for the form of an application under this section and the information and documentation that shall accompany such application,</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>)&nbsp;for the payment of fees by a person who makes an application under this section, for the purposes of defraying expenses incurred in considering such application or issuing a certificate under this section, or</P>
    <P>(<i>f</i>)&nbsp;the period in respect of which a certificate under this section shall continue in force.</P>
    <P>(5)&nbsp;The Minister may revoke a certificate under this section if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;the person to whom the certificate is issued&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)&nbsp;contravenes the regulations under this section, or </P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp;ceases to be a person to whom this section applies, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;there is a contravention of such regulations in relation to the premises concerned.</P>
    <P>(6)&nbsp;In this section &lsquo;subsidiary' has the same meaning as it has in section 155 of the Companies Act, 1963.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is to prevent a situation where the tobacco industry or companies could set up a range of subsidiaries. That cannot happen under this amendment. One cannot set up stand alone tobacco outlets in supermarkets or in any area where there are other shops and other products being sold. The amendment gives enabling powers to the Minister to grant a certificate to the very rare, individual cases that have so far been identified &ndash; I think only two have been identified &ndash; specialising in cigar, tobacco and smoking utensils. We have not banned smoking in this legislation &ndash; in other words, we have not stopped retailers from selling cigarettes which would be the logical conclusion in that if one does it for one, one has to do it for all. Representations were made by all sides of the House on this issue. My main concern was to be reasonable while at the same time making sure there were no loopholes which could subsequently be exploited by the tobacco industry.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain in layman's language what the effect would be on a company specialising in the sale of cigars which also sells cigarettes or some other product as a small part of its business? Apparently, the exemption could apply to it but I would like the Minister to spell that out. Did the Minister mention the age of 30 during his earlier contribution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The age of 30 is not in the amendment. This is an enabling measure. The Minister may introduce regulations concerning the size of the place, how many cigarettes can be sold and so forth. It really applies to a shop specialising in an expensive range of cigars. It refers more to gift shops selling smoking utensils, cigars and pipes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Members of the OTC shall not have any direct or indirect interest in the tobacco industry and the members shall make a written declaration to that effect to the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to members of the Office of Tobacco Control being required not to have any direct or indirect interest in the tobacco industry. It states that members shall make a written declaration to that effect to the Minister. It is a reasonable proposal. In the past I came across an agency under the Department of Health and Children where a person who was on the board of that agency was also involved with a tobacco company. It seemed to me an undesirable relationship. In this case, given that members of the Office of Tobacco Control will be members of an office which will have a lot of powers, it would be reasonable for them to make a declaration to the Minister that they do not have any <Col N="1187" /> direct or indirect interest in the tobacco industry. I raised this issue on Committee Stage and I think the Minister said he would reflect on it between then and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook to look at the possibility of doing this but we were advised by the parliamentary counsel that it is not necessary to accept the amendment because a similar requirement in relation to declarations will apply to members under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. This Act applies to all appointments to State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Ethics in Public Office Act would require members to make a declaration of their interests. I am looking for a declaration that they do not have any direct or indirect interest in the tobacco industry. In other words, the implications of what I am requiring are that they could not be a member of the Office of Tobacco Control if they had any such interests. If it is merely a matter of making a declaration under the Ethics Act, they could have major investments in tobacco companies and just declare them. The implications of my amendment are that they would not be suitable persons for the office because they would have to make a declaration that they do not have such an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of the day would not appoint somebody with a direct interest in the tobacco industry. The problem as I saw it on Committee Stage was that people would not know whether they had an interest and that there was no basis for declaring it. Under the Ethics Act there is a basis to so declare.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;12 shall be appointed by the Minister, of whom not less than one shall be a person or persons nominated by such body or bodies as the Minister may determine being&ndash;</P>

      <P>(ii)&nbsp;(where the Minister makes a determination in relation to more than one body) bodies that have as their principal objects, the promotion of abstinence from smoking, and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agreed on Committee Stage to consider an amendment tabled by Deputy McManus which <Col N="1188" /> provides that a member of ASH Ireland be nominated by the Minister to the Tobacco Free Council. I have discussed again with the parliamentary counsel drafting an amendment which provides for the Minister to appoint not less than one person from an anti-smoking organisation to the council. This allows for the nomination of a person from ASH or a similar organisation, without mentioning any organisation by name. The wording takes account of any name changes that might be made to ASH or similar bodies.</P>
    <P>If an organisation is included by name in legislation and subsequently alters its name, it would necessitate an amendment to the Act in the future. We have provided here that &ldquo;12 shall be appointed by the Minister, of whom not less than one shall be a person or persons nominated by such body or bodies as the Minister may determine&rdquo; and that the bodies in question have as their principal object the promotion of abstinence from smoking.</P>

      <P>This is an excellent amendment. I am delighted that the Minister has taken on board the spirit of my amendment. Perhaps he would clarify the term &ldquo;parliamentary counsel&rdquo;.

      <P>I move amendment No. 158:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 14, after &ldquo;sold&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in circumstances where the sale of the product may reasonably be regarded as increasing the sale of the tobacco product&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 33 in Part 3 deals with the prohibition of advertising of tobacco products. The effect of amendment No. 158 would be to add at the end of section 33(2)(<i>b</i>), after the words &ldquo;any trade description, designation, trademark, emblem, marketing image or logo by reference to which a tobacco product is marketed or sold&rdquo; the words &ldquo;in circumstances where the sale of the product may reasonably be regarded as increasing the sale of the tobacco product&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 159 would add a new subsection (3), which would state:</P>
      <P>The OTC may upon an application in writing exempt a brand, with such conditions attaching as the OTC at its absolute discretion may attach, that includes the name of a tobacco product where it is satisfied that the advertising of the brand is clearly distinct from the tobacco product and cannot reasonably be regarded as increasing, maintaining or supporting the sales of tobacco products.</P>
      <P>This section, dealing with the prohibition of advertising of tobacco products, is one which I strongly support. I have no difficulty with it as drafted. However, amending subsection 2(<i>b</i>) would improve it. I suggest the insertion of a new subsection (3) because it has been brought to my attention that there are companies called &ldquo;Marlboro&rdquo; that promote but which have nothing to do with the brand of cigarette. There is also a company called &ldquo;Camel&rdquo;, which promotes the cigarette, but also has a range of other businesses. It could use the title in the promotion of the other parts of the business without the intention of promoting smoking and in a way that does not promote smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not go to the wall on this amendment but I do not want to leave any loopholes. However, if we leave it in the hands of the Office of Tobacco Control, I doubt it would be likely to take a soft approach to giving an exemption to a brand in the circumstances I suggest. I have every confidence that the OTC would not take a soft approach or allow anybody to abuse the rules while at the same time ensuring that anybody who has a business, which can naturally and properly be conducted while not promoting or be seen to promote tobacco products, can go about its work in a lawful way. I am not proposing that the Minister take power or that we set such power out in the legislation. My suggestion is that the OTC would have the ability to make the exemption. Since the OTC is the gatekeeper in this matter, it certainly would not be likely to give any<Col N="1190" /> body a soft run on this issue. That seems to be the most reasonable way of dealing with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at this again since Committee Stage. The purpose of Deputy Mitchell's amendment is to deal with the possibility of a bona fide non-tobacco manufacturer or trader who coincidentally shares the same name as a tobacco manufacturer from, for instance, marketing T-shirts with its name on them. The Deputy expressed concern that the current brand-stretching provisions of the Bill would prohibit such a practice. The legal advice was that the current provisions were carefully constructed so that it would be clear to any court that the intention is to prohibit a tobacco manufacturer or trader from brand-stretching and that there is no danger of a bona fide trader, not being a tobacco manufacturer, being prosecuted. The legal advice is that the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> The purpose of this amendment is to insert in section 38(1), which deals with the prohibition of certain marketing practices, a new power for the Minister. Section 38(1) at present provides that it shall be an offence for persons to sell cigarettes by retail other than in a packet containing not less than 20 cigarettes. The amendment would add a new paragraph (<i>b</i>) to provide that the Minister could increase the minimum number of cigarettes in a packet, if the size of tobacco packets changes. I understand that in some countries there are packets of 25 cigarettes. That is the purpose of the amendment. I raised this on Committee Stage and the Minister undertook to come back to it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>We sought legal advice on this amendment to which, as I said on Committee Stage, I was favourably disposed. The issue has been considered in depth by the parliamentary counsel and I have been strongly advised against accepting such an amendment or moving a similar one on the grounds that it could make the Bill vulnerable to an attack. Foreign manufacturers might contend that, if we unilaterally increased the number of cigarettes in a packet to 25, it would not be worth their while to supply the Irish market because of that restriction. They could contend that this would amount to competitive advantage being given to domestic manufacturers and constitute a quantitative restriction on trade between member states. The advice is that it would be safer to seek to make progress on the issue at European level at which there have been numerous assaults on tobacco legislation in the context of internal market regulations, because of which one EU directive was struck down. On that basis I pull back from accepting the amendment.</P>

If we were to move towards packets of 25, 26 or 27, there would be a situation where there would be different packet sizes in different markets and manufacturers within Europe would claim they were being deprived of a particular market. It could be construed as a trade barrier.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" />In page 27, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Proceedings under <i>subsection (3)</i> shall be held <i>in camera</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to take account of the fact that an application from a manufacturer or importer under subsection (3) would be grounded on the contention that the proposal of the office to publish information or results of tests under subsection (1) would result in the disclosure of a secret manufacturing process. Our strong legal advice is that such a hearing would have to be <i>in camera</i>, an oversight not provided for in the first instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very suspicious of the tobacco industry. I have no confidence in the bona fides of those behind it. They are wealthy and devious individuals who have avoided their duty to appear before a committee of this House when asked to do so. As they may be compelled to do so, depending on the outcome of a court case dealing with another matter, I am suspicious of any changes that will allow them to make their case <i>in camera</i>. Section 41(3) already states that the High Court, if of the opinion that the publication of information or the results of tests in accordance with subsection (1) would result in the disclosure of a secret manufacturing process, may direct the agency not to publish this information or results upon application being made to the High Court in that behalf by the manufacturer or importer concerned. I would prefer if proceedings under subsection (3) were held <i>in camera</i> at the discretion of the High Court. If, at its discretion, the High Court was of the view that there was a case of a secret manufacturing process being made available, fine, but in using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; we are directing it. I have a difficulty with this.</P>
      <P>There is a deliberate strategy on the part of the tobacco industry not to disclose a secret manufacturing process, not because competitors would find out &ndash; I am certain they already know each other's processes &ndash; but because legislators, the courts, journalists or the public might find out. The evidence points towards the fact that there are variations made to make the product deliberately addictive. Further evidence has been given that this product is more addictive than heroin or cocaine. Clearly, as heroin and cocaine do damage more quickly, I do not put it in that league, but it is highly addictive. They target this addictive product at very young people. That is their objective &ndash; to get them using the product and guarantee their future sales, thereby increasing the cancer rate in any country where this trend is followed. I am very nervous about the people concerned having the power to keep this secret. I, therefore, ask the Minister to accept that he should delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute that hearings may be held<i> in camera </i>at the discretion of the High Court. That would be more reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3), at the bottom of page 26, contains the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; in the sense that the High Court may, if of the opinion that the publication of information or the results of tests in accordance with subsection (1) would result in the disclosure of a secret manufacturing process, direct the agency not to publish such information or results upon application being made to the High Court in that behalf by the manufacturer or importer concerned. Subsection (6) states that proceedings under subsection (3) shall be held<i> in camera</i>, on the presumption that if the case is being taken on the basis of not disclosing a secret manufacturing process, obviously, it will have to be held <i>in camera</i>.</P>
      <P>The substantive point &ndash; I have examined this matter at some length and discussed it in depth with the parliamentary counsel &ndash; is that I do not want the Bill to be struck down. I have been strongly warned that it would be vulnerable to challenge if subsection (3) was deleted. This balancing act is a safeguard to protect the Bill in terms of subsequent assaults that may come. I am under no illusions that once the Bill passes through both Houses it may come under legal assault from various interests. That is the advice I received and, faced with it, I had no option but to safeguard the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that. The House is being too malleable in accepting the concerns and implied threats of the tobacco industry that it will go to the courts, in which I have every confidence in this type of situation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but we are introducing a new section. We are recommitting the Bill to facilitate it. It requires, under amendment No. 192, that a new subsection (6) be inserted stating that under subsection (3) the proceedings shall be held <i>in camera</i>. What is wrong with using the word &ldquo;may&ldquo;? Why are we binding the courts with the word &ldquo;shall&ldquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the problem be in leaving the decision to the High Court? If the High Court is of the opinion that the publication of information on results in accordance with subsection (1) would result in the disclosure surely, if it had the option &ndash;&ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;<Col N="1194" />&ndash; it would follow the logic and hear the case <i>in camera</i>? Why are we tying the hands of the High Court? I do not like the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this particular case. We should leave it to the discretion of the High Court. The Legislature would be unnecessarily binding the hands of the High Court in these circumstances. I take the Minister's point that if it goes as far as section 3 and says that there is a case, the logic would follow that maybe it would be held <i>in camera</i>. It may not always follow, however, and so we should leave it to the discretion of the court. Rather than saying it &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, I think we should say it &ldquo;may&rdquo;. The difficulty is that we recommitted this on Report Stage and we do not have very much time to deal with it. If the logic is that having accepted that there may be the possibility of a disclosure of a secret process becoming public, presumably the High Court would have the ability to decide under &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; that it would take the course the Minister presumes to be obvious. It may not be obvious in every case, however. There may be circumstances where the High Court does not want to hear cases <i>in camera</i>. It may well be that the court wishes to put manners on a stroppy applicant. We should insert the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; here instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concerns but I have received strong legal advice on this matter. I argued the toss over it for quite some time and have aired it thoroughly with the parliamentary counsel. The legal advice was that if the Bill was to be challenged subsequently the insertion of subsection (3), and subsection (6) which is allied to it, was an essential safeguard to protect the Bill in terms of reasonableness.</P>

What threats or contacts have there been from the tobacco industry? What contact has there been from solicitors or others acting on behalf of the industry? Where did this proposal come from? If it came from the parliamentary counsel why then did the counsel not insert this in the original draft or put forward an amendment on Committee Stage? This concern was not raised on Committee Stage by any member of the committee or by the Minister, so where did this proposal come from?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It came from the parliamentary counsel. I have had no representations on this issue from anybody and I have had no engagement from the tobacco industry on the Bill at all. It has written in but I have met nobody. I have not entertained any proposals from the tobacco industry in respect of this Bill or, indeed, any proposal contained in the Bill. This came exclusively from the parliamentary counsel. According to my note, it was an oversight which led to the fact that it was not provided for on Committee Stage. I <Col N="1195" /> take that in good faith and I can assure the Deputy that is the only reason I have not accepted his amendment. We discussed the entire subsection on Committee Stage when many representations were made about the appropriateness or otherwise of inserting subsection (3). That is the issue I re-examined. After a long discussion it was made clear to me that if I was to take it out, I would do so at my peril and might render the entire Bill vulnerable to legal challenge. So, I opted for safety.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some concluding remarks on this Bill. Both sides of the House put a lot of work into it and I am glad to see its passage. I had the honour to be the rapporteur for the second report on smoking by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. It was published some months ago. The committee received a number of submissions from interested parties and committee members were well prepared for this legislation and well rehearsed on the issues involved. There are some quite frightening statistics in relation to smoking and tobacco. We heard evidence that says tobacco kills between 6,500 and 7,000 people in Ireland every year, that 31% of the population smokes and that between 35% and 40% of children are smoking before they reach the age of 18 years. We heard evidence that nicotine is more addictive than heroin or cocaine and that the tob<Col N="1202" /> acco industry was the first to know that nicotine was addictive, long before the anti-tobacco lobby had similar knowledge. We heard a wide range of information in relation to the tobacco industry, including that almost half of all those admitted to Saint James's Hospital in Dublin are suffering with smoke-related illnesses. There are now 1.1 billion smokers worldwide but by 2025 it is estimated that the figure will rise by 1.6 million. According to the report of the Royal College of Physicians in Britain, tobacco is one of the greatest causes of preventable and premature deaths.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about passive smoking. The Minister now has powers under this Bill and has specifically taken powers in relation to licensed premises. This was at my request and that of the Oireachtas Joint Committee and at his own initiative. He was criticised in an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>and I think it was for something I said rather than he said. I am strongly supportive of any steps to eradicate or reduce passive smoking. Based on statistics published in the United States, indirect smoking is the biggest killer after direct tobacco smoking and alcohol. It is reasonable to presume from those figures that something in the order of 879 people a year probably die in this country from passive smoking, inhaling the smoke of others. The problem is that they do not know they are doing it. Somebody having a pint in a pub is inhaling the tobacco of others. There was a time when people put up with that and did not complain because they thought it was the norm.</P>
      <P>If people knew of the dangers to their health from passive smoking, particularly in public houses, there would be a huge outcry. The Government would carry out a campaign on television and radio, presumably with the Minister in the starring role, at least until the general election, telling people of the dangers. Indirect smoking is as dangerous a threat to life as the likelihood of being killed in a road traffic accident. While I do not have the figures on road traffic accidents before me, perhaps as many as 800 to 900 people die from indirect smoking per annum. There is an alarming lack of awareness by members of the public that they are exposed to this danger.</P>
      <P>Publicans constitute a strong lobby. I have mentioned the situation in my local pub to the Minster. He is throwing his eyes to heaven but he must address this issue. The death rate in Ireland, especially from cancer and heart disease, is well above that of the European Union, which is itself above that of Canada. People in this country die younger than their peers in the European Union and much younger than their peers in Canada. We take that for granted. We talk about preventative medicine and changes in lifestyles, yet this is one area where the health of people is threatened and they are not even aware of it. It is time we made them aware that passive smoking is a threat and one that emanates primarily from public houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Office of Tobacco Control to use <Col N="1203" /> its powers to heighten the awareness of the public on this issue. We need a counter balance to the powerful lobby the publicans have at their disposal. If the office can harness the support of the public and if in response the public takes up this issue with Deputies action will be taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be deterred on this issue. He should use the powers granted to him under this legislation to deal with public houses and he should get the process under way sooner rather than later. In my draft report I suggested that a ban on smoking should be imposed in parts of public houses, at least initially, but by all-party consensus the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children amended that to call for a ban on smoking in pubs and recommended that if people wanted to smoke they should go outside or into a side room. I realise to achieve that immediately would be difficult but the Minister now has the power to achieve it in part, or all, of licensed premises. He should act on it.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Office of Tobacco Control to please act as a counter balance to the powerful publicans' lobby. If it can secure the support of the public, especially the young public, Deputies will listen and will act to reverse the dramatic trend of greater risk of dying from passive smoking, notwithstanding the colourful comments of a colourful and prominent columnist with<i> The Irish Times. </i>I ask the Minister to act quickly and I hope the Office of Tobacco Control will act in the way I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Mitchell and McManus for their constructive approach to this legislation. The all-party support for the broad thrust of the Bill has been very important in terms of a broader political consensus on taking on the tobacco industry and in endeavouring to create an environment that will reduce the incidence of tobacco smoking and the consumption of tobacco. Without question, this is the single greatest health challenge facing the country. While we talk about other issues &ndash; I am often amused by the way in which people become exercised by a range of other environmental issues &ndash; we are not sufficiently aware that the smoking of cigarettes constitutes the greatest single threat to human health in this country. It is responsible for 7,000 deaths per annum and has a huge impact on the quality of life of those over the age of 40 years if they smoke for prolonged periods in terms of asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, other lung diseases and a range of cardiac problems.</P>
      <P>We top the European league table in terms of heart disease and are very high in terms of cancer. In no small measure that is due to smoking. The most alarming aspect of the most recent statistics available to us from the Cancer Registry, covering the years 1994-98, is the fact that lung cancer among Irish women is, I understand, over 50% above the European average. It is an appalling statistic and can be directly related to smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" />I accept Deputy Mitchell's remarks on passive smoking. The research shows it can kill and cause significant damage to people's health. I also compliment the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for its considered approach to the Bill and for the work it has done in producing two reports on tobacco. They complement and support the work of the Department over the past years. I pay warm tribute to my officials for the work they put into the Bill and to the Parliamentary Counsel. The counsel is under enormous strain dealing with a number of Bills in rapid succession, yet it managed to produce this Bill and acted with great patience when we pushed it to draft a significant number of amendments between Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>After just one year of existence the Office of Tobacco Control has shown its influence. Last week there was a very good debate on environmental smoking at a seminar on passive smoking, which I opened. The potential figure of 150 bar workers dying ever year from passive smoking was cited. The office is developing as a very effective counter balance to the tobacco industry in raising these issues for public debate. Significantly, people from the broader trade union movement attended the seminar. We want the movement to change its attitude to the use of increases in the price of cigarettes impacting on the consumer price index as a basis for wage increases. If we could get that stopped it would be a major development in terms of dealing with the tobacco problem.</P>
    <P>The Office of Tobacco Control has also commissioned opinion surveys which show that the majority of smokers favour prohibitions and restrictions on passive smoking in pubs and the work place. This legislation has the potential to prohibit or restrict smoking in any public place. We have added to the list of places that can be affected and I intend to use the regulations as soon as the Bill is passed by the other House. I thank all concerned, including the external non-governmental organisations, such as ASH, who made significant contributions to the debate in the form of suggested amendments and constructive criticisms of earlier drafts of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;that over 850 major primary and post primary school building projects are awaiting sanction to proceed to construction phase in the Department of Education and Science;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" />&ndash;&nbsp;the contents of a recent INTO survey of 75 primary schools in substandard conditions;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the adverse impact which substandard classrooms have on both staff and students;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the deliberate failure of the Minister for Education and Science to keep boards of management, parents associations, students, staff and elected representatives informed as to the current status of individual school projects;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;condemns the Government for its failure to manage the school building programme and calls for a radical overhaul of the school building unit in the Department of Education and Science to facilitate greater use of public private partnerships, a move to design and build contracts, grater input by local boards of management and increased capital provision to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Clune, Tom Hayes, Finucane, Reynolds and Naughten.</P>
    <P>The recent INTO survey found that 66% of the 75 schools listed have inadequate toilet facilities; 50% have inadequate hand washing or drying facilities; 40% do not have an adequate heating system; 43% either have no drinking water or water that is unfit to drink; 47% have rotting windows or doors; 71% have an inadequate or unsafe school yard and most do not have basic facilities such as general purpose rooms, a principal's office, staff room or a room when extra tuition can be given by learning support teachers.</P>
    <P>Imagine a day in the life of a student in such a school. He or she turns up in the morning to find it inadequately heated. He or she may be in need of remedial attention, but is often forced to learn or avail of such additional tuition in a corridor or converted coal bunker. I suggest we forget the adversarial nature of politics and try to make progress on what is an enormous problem. I estimate that, between primary and post-primary schools, in the region of 250,000 pupils are in substandard teaching accommodation and classroom facilities. That has to have an adverse impact on the quality of education that can be imparted to them. We do not have a monopoly of wisdom as to the solutions, but all Members recognise unreservedly that this is a problem of crisis proportions. The way it is being dealt with by the Department of Education and Science is inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment is predictable, but disappointing. It refers to the fourfold increase in its capital allocation, which I acknowledge. The Minister for Education and Science has had unprecedented riches, but the sad reality is that he has problems of unprecedented proportions and is failing to deal with them. There is little point in saying he has increased funding fourfold if he has not made a dent in resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment refers to the &ldquo;vast number of projects now progressing through architectural planning and construction.&rdquo;<Col N="1206" /> If the Minister speaks with boards of management and principals who have spent hours, days and weeks trying to make contact with the school building unit in Tullamore to find out the status of their individual school project, they will tell him about the projects now progressing through architectural planning and construction. The amendment goes on to state that the Government &ldquo;notes the determination of the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to continue the greatly expanded school building programme.&rdquo; I shall refer to this later because there is damning evidence of the Government's intended allocation for primary and post-primary school buildings in 2003 and 2004.</P>
    <P>If progress is to be made on this issue, the type of amendment sponsored by the Government is not helpful. It does not recognise there is a problem. This side of the House is committed to assisting the Government in its dying days to put proposals in place, which we look forward to implementing when on the other side of the House. A vast array of radical proposals would enable us over a period to halve the estimated waiting time of six years between the date the Department recognises a problem in a school and is in a position some six years later to cut the tape and officially open that new school. That is an enormous problem which is consigning students from the day they arrive in post-primary school until they complete their leaving certificate six years later to substandard classroom facilities. It is probably only a matter of time in the litigious environment in which we live until some child and some parent takes the Department to court because of inadequate facilities. We would do well to sit up and take note of the shortcomings of policy in this area.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for tabling this Private Members' motion is that the Department gets poor value for the money it spends. To make this point I draw to the Minister's attention a particular project which happens to be in my home town. If the Department does not take note, it will end up costing the taxpayer at least £1 million extra if it does not avail of opportunities to resolve a particular problem. St. Coleman's national school caters for boys from first to sixth classes. It has been recognised by the Department as being inadequate and is, to use the Minister's infamous words in the Government amendment, one of the &ldquo;projects now progressing through architectural planning and construction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a unique circumstance in so far as a developer has acquired land at the rear of the existing school. He has made an offer to the school to provide free gratis a site to the Department for a new school. On one occasion it was mooted that he may even, under a public-private partnership arrangement, construct the school for the Department provided he was allowed to demolish the existing school building to gain access to the remainder of the site which he proposes to develop for commercial purposes. The Department recognises that this is a suitable site for the school, but is dragging its feet, either deliberately at the Minister's behest or because <Col N="1207" /> staff in the Department are overworked due to the volume of projects in hand.</P>

There are numerous examples throughout the length and breadth of the country where it can be argued that because of foot dragging and the inability of the Department, for whatever reason, to move swiftly on these projects it is costing the taxpayer more money.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion calls on the Government to move to design and build contracts. Any Member who has had occasion to make representations to the school building unit in Tullamore knows the long drawn out, cumbersome procedure. Every school principal, board of management and parents association is equally familiar with it. From obtaining sanction for a new school, through the Department's inspectors, to working towards the appointment of architects, going through the planning process, drawing up tender documents, inviting tenders, signing contracts and proceeding to construction the average length of time is in excess of six years.</P>
      <P>Due to the delay with another school, Aghina national school, included in the INTO survey of 75 primary schools, the Department has undermined its viability. Sanctioned six years ago the Minister is now questioning whether it should proceed because of a declining enrolment. The reality is that had he proceeded with all due haste the school would, perhaps, now be in a position where it would be seeking an extension rather than have a question mark over its future viability. There are many schools in a similar position which are suffering declining enrolments because parents refuse to send their children to schools which are so substandard as to detrimentally affect the quality of education in the classroom. The Minister would do well to face up to the reality, recognise there is a crisis in the school building unit of his Department and take the necessary steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A move to design and build contracts is one step that would substantially resolve the problem. The Minister would hand over to a contractor the obligation to bring about a solution and the Department's role would merely be to set standards and conditions of contract. Given the extent of the problem, a case can also be made for considering the use of generic designs. <Col N="1208" /> Schools could lift one from an architect's table and apply it without all the toing and froing with the Department about specifications such as the size of windows or electrical installations. Such detail is bogging down projects, a problem which could be substantially circumvented by moving to design and build contracts.</P>
    <P>It is also obvious that the Department of Education and Science is extremely reluctant to embrace the concept of public private partnerships. After five years in Government, the Minister mentioned just five projects which are progressing using public private partnerships. If my memory serves me correctly, three of these are in Cork &ndash; the school of music, the maritime college and&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been more progress than I thought. Public private partnership must be used to attract additional capital because the resources available to the State are clearly limited. It is a very useful way of getting projects, notably larger ones, completed quickly without an immediate or upfront cost to the State. The mindset prevailing in the Department of Education and Science obviously has a problem with embracing the concept given that after five years in Government only five post-primary schools are being built using the model.</P>
      <P>It is also necessary to apply the simple solution of increasing capital provision. It is very interesting to note in the projected Estimates, contained in the documentation on the budget, the amount of capital the Minister proposes to allocate to primary and post-primary education in 2003 and 2004. I understand the figures were published because of the obligation under the growth and stability pact to notify the Commission of projected expenditure several years in advance.</P>

      <P>Indicative or otherwise, the figures published by the Minister demonstrate that the school building programme will be decimated. The allocation for 2003 is &euro;116 million as opposed to &euro;184 million in 2002. The news for 2004 is even worse in both the primary and secondary sectors. If these figures are indicative of the Government's commitment to resolving the problems in primary and post-primary schools, God help the schools building programme. No better argument for voting against the Government could be advanced to the parents and teachers of children in and boards of management of substandard schools than this indication of failure.</P>

      <P>There is a standard reply issuing from the Department. During the discussion of the education Estimates at the meeting of the Committee on Education and Science on 4 December 2001, Deputy Shortall vigorously pursued the Minister on the question of publishing a database which would allow school principals and everyone else involved in the process to find out the exact position of their school in terms of the Department's building commitments. The Minister has steadfastly refused to publish the database, despite the undertaking he gave to the meeting when he stated: &ldquo;I will prepare a list and publish it.&rdquo; Why has he not done so? I suspect, and it is the Minister's duty to convince the House otherwise, that he is facilitating the election bus tour of the Taoiseach to cherry pick projects in marginal constituencies for electoral benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hayes and I were in Tipperary South during a by-election campaign in which Gaelscoil Clonmel was a contentious issue. The Minister sent one of his messenger boys to a public meeting one night to deliver good news about the gaelscoil, a move which did not work then and will not work in a general election because parents, teachers and pupils are fed up to the back teeth with being led a merry dance by the Minister and with the replies he gives to parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>We want a transparent system that would readily identify the Department's priorities and put an end to the cherry picking of projects. This occurred only a week or ten days ago when the Taoiseach visited Scoil Charman in Wexford and plucked a new building out of the clouds, despite the Minister having informed the House a week previously that the school was not making progress. This is the reason he is reluctant to publish the database.</P>
      <P>He has the necessary information at his fingertips. I challenge him again to publish it and to allow everyone to see where their school stands in the order of departmental priorities. Otherwise, he will continue to face a barrage of questions on the Order Paper and his non-answers, which cause frustration among boards of management and parents who have attended constituency clinics to ask that parliamentary questions be tabled, will continue. The replies given to Members to questions about specific school projects are not being answered in the detail requested. This is an abuse of Members which should be investigated. Perhaps it is of interest to the Ceann Comhairle in the context of Members' interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not wish to pursue the matter further now, I understood the Ceann Comhairle has a role in this area. Perhaps my understanding of the issue is not as clear as the Ceann Comhairle's. Outside bodies, not least the beef tribunal, have commented on the failure of Departments to adequately answer questions. The Department in question in the case of the beef tribunal was the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Had the questions been answered, we would have avoided the need to establish the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Minister has difficulties recognising the problem. As I said, at a conservative estimate 250,000 pupils are being educated in substandard classrooms. We have innovative proposals to make greater use of public private partnerships for schools building projects. They are viable alternatives to the current system for large schools building projects. With just five projects approved for schools to date, the Department of Education and Science appears hostile to these partnerships. A move to design and build contracts would eliminate a large part of the bureaucracy which engulfs the Department's school building unit. The only role for the Department would be to establish standards and conditions.</P>
      <P>There is also a role for greater involvement of boards of management. Through their active involvement on the ground in the progression of a school building project, they could deliver greater value for money than the Department delivers in its splendid isolation in Tullamore. Given the scale of the problem, a significant increase in the capital provision for the school building unit is necessary in the coming years, which is where this side of the House and the Minister have considerable differences. His planned expenditure for school buildings in 2003 and 2004, as contained in this year's budget projections, is for declining investment in school buildings. This is entirely unacceptable and we will fight on this issue on the highways and byways during the election campaign.</P>
      <P>We also demand the publication of the database. My colleague, Deputy Shortall, has pursued the Minister relentlessly on this issue but he is ducking and weaving. He has given the commitment but he will not put a date on it because he wants to tour the country and cherry-pick projects for electoral advantage. Members of the public are too wise to fall for that. They did not fall for it in regard to Gaelscoil Clonmel and other primary school projects during the by-election, and they will not fall for it during a general election.</P>

      <P>This is an important motion and I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Creed, for bringing it forward because it gives all of us an opportunity to vent the frustration we experience <Col N="1211" /> in our constituencies. The Order Paper is littered with questions on the state of play of various school building projects, be they primary or secondary schools, yet we get the same standard reply from the Department of Education and Science. That is frustrating for us in terms of trying to deal with the Department but it is more frustrating for the boards of management, parents and pupils in these schools.</P>
      <P>A statement was made in one reply from the Minister that the 2002 allocation will be &euro;153 million, four times the previous Government investment in 1997. Is the Minister comparing 1997 prices to those in 2002? Since that time we have had construction costs inflation, which has averaged at 10%, 12% or 13% on a yearly basis. More money is available and there is a high expectation of the Government to deliver on the promised school building programmes throughout the country, as outlined by Deputy Creed. Why are we still waiting on those? What is the difficulty? Is the Minister waiting for the election campaign to get under way so that wonderful announcements can be made in every constituency? As Deputy Creed pointed out, that will not work because people are wise to that. Is it the case that too many promises were made and we must wait until after the election to hear the bad news? People are sceptical in terms of the Government delivering on their school building programmes.</P>
      <P>The INTO survey of school conditions was damning. I visited a school in my own constituency last week, Coláiste Mhuire in Crosshaven, which is awaiting a refurbishment and extension programme. To address the problem of the clapped out heating system, this year all the children were issued with special double fleece jackets, equivalent to a sailing jacket, which they put on when they sit in the classrooms to keep out the cold. That is the state of a school less than ten miles from Cork city. We are told the project is at the pre-phase 2 stage. What does that mean? We cannot work it out, but it is stuck somewhere in the bowels of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to give careful consideration to this proposal to facilitate greater use of public private partnerships and introduce a design and build programme so that we can accelerate the school building programme. That is something very worthwhile and I am aware it has been talked about in some schools. It would certainly advance the programmes and will show people that there is some light at the end of the tunnel and that we can progress. Schools have been promised extensions since 1999, yet nothing has been done and frustration is being experienced by boards of management, parents, pupils and principals throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments of my colleague and commend Deputy Creed for tabling this important and timely motion. The motion is more important than the Minister realises because to say there is a crisis in the school building programme is to put it mildly. <Col N="1212" /> This is the worst ever crisis in terms of any school building programme. This morning I drew up a list of the number of schools in my constituency which have sought additional classrooms, new buildings, etc. and I will return to that shortly.</P>
      <P>We have heard much in this House and elsewhere about the benefits of the Celtic tiger, but everyone will agree that our education system was its foundation. We are very proud of our education system, the way it has developed and what it has achieved over the past number of years. The problem, however, is the number of sub-standard schools and it is grossly unfair to expect people to work in these schools.</P>
      <P>I drew up a list earlier today of the 14 schools in the constituency of South Tipperary about which representations have been made to me since Christmas. I will start with Ballytarsna. A promise was made by the Minister a year and a half ago that a new school would be built in Ballytarsna, on the borders of north and south Tipperary, yet nothing has been done and a site has not even been purchased for the school. St. Michael's national school, Mullinahone, is 100 years old and badly in need of refurbishment, but nothing has happened in relation to that school. Ballyclerihan is one of the worst schools in the constituency. It is on a split site which means that half the pupils attend the local national school. They have to cross a busy road between Cashel and Clonmel which, at a time when there is an enormous amount of traffic, is a danger to them and their parents who have to collect them. Two teachers use the local hall and the other three are in the national school across the road. That is not good enough. Many more schools, such as Tankardstown, Bansha and others, have sought extra rooms.</P>
      <P>My own former national school, Thomastown, has sought an additional classroom for many years but nothing has happened in relation to that request. The national school in Lisrona, a rapidly developing area on the outskirts of Clonmel, is in dire need of additional classrooms. Mount Bruce, outside Tipperary town, has an accommodation problem going back over the years yet nothing has been done about it. Drangan national school outside Fethard is another case in point.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Gaelscoil outside Fethard which Deputy Creed mentioned, the people were promised that funding would be made available but I spoke to the chairman of the board of management only yesterday and he told me that a site has not been purchased despite the promises made in two by-elections. That is the greatest scandal in the entire constituency.</P>
      <P>The list is endless and I put it to the Minister that he is neglecting the people of south Tipperary and, regardless of who stands in the next election, we will fight him mile by mile on the roads of south Tipperary to highlight the neglect of the next generation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past five years, this Government spoke <i>ad nauseam</i> about the Celtic tiger economy but if we examine the state of our public services today, one would think we had five years of the worst recession in history. Our <Col N="1213" /> education system has seen the brunt of this under-investment and the schools in County Roscommon are no different to those anywhere else. There is massive overcrowding. Cloakrooms are being used as classrooms, especially for the most disadvantaged, those requiring remedial and resource teaching. Many of the schools have no hot water, giving rise to public health concerns, and are without adequate heating or insulation systems. One would not put pigs in many of the toilet facilities, let alone ask pupils to use them every day of the week.</P>
      <P>Is the Government trying to close the smaller schools by stealth, forcing parents to send children to other schools due to the 19th century facilities? As a result of the decline in numbers, many of these schools are now under pressure in relation to their viability. The Government is doing the same with regard to Garda stations. Smaller schools are feeling the brunt because the Government is ensuring they do not have even the most basic facilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister's latest measure is to deny 20,000 children the right to remedial education due to the enforcement of a points system. Although Fianna Fáil said in its manifesto in 1997 that it would examine the third level points system to put in place a more humane system, it now wants to enforce a callous points system for the most vulnerable in the education system.</P>
      <P>The Government, which in its dying days stands over a dilapidated and rundown system, proposes to introduce auction politics in over 850 schools which seek funding to provide basic facilities to ensure the proper education of children. Only a fraction of these substandard schools will receive funding; the rest will have to wait for over two and a half years before they will be considered by the building unit in Tullamore, which faces a crisis of resources. As Deputy Creed said, the delays in the building unit mean it takes six years to process an application. I know of a case where it took the Department of Education and Science a year and a half to decide whether to build a new primary school or to refurbish the existing school. It should not take 18 months to make such a basic decision.</P>
      <P>A proposal in relation to Elphin community college has been on a desk in the Department for a number of years. Children have to walk half a mile in the rain to get from one section of the school to another which has been rented by the Department of Education and Science and which is in a dilapidated state. The money would be better spent on redeveloping the existing school to ensure it is based in a single campus rather than spread all over the town. I wholeheartedly endorse the proposals to radically overhaul the Department's building unit and to ensure greater use of public private partnership so that these matters can be expedited. Schools need to be quickly approved for funding so children can be educated in facilities of a decent standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the dying weeks of the Government, as the Minister for Education and Science reflects on the past five years, he will note serious deficiencies in the provision of primary <Col N="1214" /> education. The Irish National Teachers' Organisation's list of schools in critical need of development contains two schools in my constituency, in Pallaskenry and Kilfinnane, and I could list many other schools in County Limerick in a state of disrepair. When we talk about Dáil reform, it is regrettable that we do not address the lack of honesty in answers to parliamentary questions. One of the most frustrating aspects of being a Deputy is the answers we are given to questions about schools. When we attend the Adjournment debate to articulate the concerns of schools, pupils and teachers, we are given an exercise in obfuscation, so that Opposition Members will not be able to relay any snippet of worthwhile information.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that a few announcements in relation to primary schools in marginal constituencies like Limerick West will be made as the election approaches, as Deputy Creed has said. Having said that, it is probable that if it is announced that something will happen, it will be too late for many people. Fine Gael hopes to be in office to oversee the implementation of the Minister's announcements, which have been very few. The quality of our primary schools is an indictment of the Minister. I am not impressed, especially as he was quite efficient when he was responsible for social welfare and he replied to Members' questions on areas of concern. As Deputy Creed said, many questions are asked about education at present, which is symptomatic of the frustration of Members.</P>
      <P>When I see the Minister, Deputy Woods, sitting alone on the Government benches for the entire evening, I wonder about the level of concern among Government Members as regards education. I am sure they must be concerned about schools in their constituencies, but do they articulate their concerns to the Minister? The Minister has washed his hands of the crisis in primary education. I look forward to when my party is in Government and there is a new Minister for Education and Science, with a dynamic approach to seriously addressing the situation at primary level.</P>
      <P>I could talk at length about the problems at second level and the crisis in our secondary schools, where teachers are frustrated. The Minister is a cause of much of the malaise in education circles at present, as he has procrastinated and obfuscated. I compliment Deputy Creed for putting down this motion, which is an indictment of the Minister, Deputy Woods, as many Members welcome the chance to articulate their frustrations.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to speak on this motion and I compliment Deputy Creed on his foresight in bringing it before the house. The building unit of the Department of Education and Science is a shambles, as a result of the Minister who has presided over it. The most cynical decision he made was to hold back the information necessary to make public the priority list of school building projects within his Department. The political expediency he has tried to pursue for electoral advantage is horrendous. It <Col N="1215" /> is scandalous that he has allowed teachers and pupils to spend their days in substandard facilities for political advantage and I am horrified that the Taoiseach shares such cynicism. The Government's policy is to survey schools &ndash; 850 have already been examined &ndash; but not to provide funding for improvements. Who do the Taoiseach and the Minister think they are representing? The people will not fall for the cynicism and political expediency of waiting to cherry-pick schools in marginal constituencies. I say that as one who represents the marginal constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will soon announce the commencement of building works for new post-primary schools in Ballinamore and Mohill. The approval of the new schools was announced to great fanfare, but nothing has happened yet. The new primary school in Mohill, which will be an amalgamation of two schools, is badly needed as the existing school is in as bad a condition as its secondary equivalent. Representatives of the school met the Minister and officials from his Department, only to be told that money will only be given when £25,000 has been collected in Mohill and a site found. Nothing has happened. I would be horrified if I discovered the Minister is taking the people of Mohill for fools.</P>
      <P>There are also problems in schools in County Sligo, including Calry national school. A Fianna Fáil candidate in the next general election is a resident of the parish of Calry, so I hope money will be provided for the school there. What about Carbury national school, in the middle of Sligo town, which has been looking for funding for many years but has not received it? It is outrageous that these schools have not been improved, just as it is outrageous that the Minister for Education and Science will not publicise his Department's priority list. It will be even more outrageous if the Minister cherry-picks schools to gain political advantage. The Ursuline College in Sligo, which has almost 600 pupils, has received planning permission and a fire certificate for four special classrooms, four ordinary classrooms and a sports hall. Representatives of the school met architects and the building unit of the Department and were told that money was available, but the Minister has not yet said that construction can proceed. It is terrible, in 2002, that students have horrendous physical education facilities. They have to tog out in substandard conditions on terrible days like today.</P>
      <P>The Minister has presided over a shambles in the building unit of his Department, but the most cynical exercise which I abhor is the holding back of announcements for political advantage. I assure the Minister that Fianna Fáil will not retain its two seats in the constituency even when the announcements are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;noting:&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the Government's commitment towards <Col N="1216" /> improving school accommodation as demonstrated by the fourfold increase in funding since coming to office;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the dramatic expansion of the school building and refurbishment programme at primary and secondary level;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the vast number of projects now progressing through architectural planning and construction;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the commencement of work on five major school building projects under the public private partnership and the preparation of further PPPs;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;the measures already taken and the further measures planned to devolve responsibility to schools to deal directly with more of their own building projects; commends the Government for the many improvements in school accommodation already carried out and notes the determination of the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to continue the greatly expanded school building programme in order to both meet new and emerging needs and to eliminate any substandard accommodation which has accumulated because of generations of under-investment.</P>
    <P>In asking the House to endorse the Government's record achievements in investing in school buildings, I want to dispel the myths being peddled by the Opposition that, in some way, that programme of investment has come to a halt. I want to expose for what it is the ludicrous proposition that this Government, a Government which every year has increased spending on school building, would, for some reason, back away from its resolve to tackle once and for all the deficiencies in school infrastructure. Let me make it clear from the outset that we are doing what others failed to do in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to set out from where we have come, where we are and where we are going regarding the entire school building programme. Let me be unequivocal &ndash; as a result of past under-investment over the course of decades, the reality is that many schools are in a poor state of repair and require substantial funding for upgrading to meet modern requirements. Many of the schools built in the 1970s and 1980s in particular were low-cost, high-maintenance buildings that are now at the end of their natural lives and will have to be rebuilt over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the simplistic views being peddled by the Opposition, it is not possible to wipe out in the lifetime of one Government the cumulative deficit of generations and to deal with emerging needs at the same time. The audacity of the Opposition in seeking to turn this issue into a political football is incredible given that it is only in the lifetime of this Government that there has been an increase in the level of investment which is capable of making a real difference.</P>
    <P>There is no hiding from the facts which show the sea change we have brought about since 1997 and demonstrate clearly and unambiguously our sustained commitment to rectifying the deficit <Col N="1217" /> and to provide for new building needs. It is revealing to look at where we were when the parties opposite were last in Government and what has happened since. The last Government when leaving office planned to spend a paltry &euro;91.6 million on educational infrastructure. By contrast, every year since the Government took office, we have poured massive sums of money into modernising educational infrastructure. It may be painful for the Opposition to listen to this. It is said that the truth often hurts, but so be it.</P>
    <P>I will now outline to the House the undeniable facts. In 1998, we spent &euro;133.2 million on first and second level educational infrastructure, an increase of 45% on the spending the previous Government provided in 1997. In 1999, we again increased educational infrastructural spending by up to &euro;194 million, an increase of 113% on the Opposition's 1997 allocation. In 2000, yet again this Government was not found wanting. Educational infrastructural spending at first and second level was again increased, this time to &euro;257.5 million, or 181% of the Opposition's allocation in 1997. Last year we again increased spending to &euro;317.68 million, or 246% of the Opposition's allocation in 1997.</P>
    <P>When we come to the current year, we are looking at proposed spending of &euro;337.6 million, an increase of 370%, or, to put it fully into context, almost four times more than that allocated by the parties opposite when they left Government a scant five years ago. Despite our undeniable track record, the parties opposite want to play cheap politics and create an impression that the Government has been inactive or has mismanaged the building programme.</P>
    <P>Let me dispel another myth promoted by the Opposition in an effort to cause confusion among the public. The Opposition fully expected the capital allocation for 2002 to be less than that for 2001. This was before the final Estimates for 2002 for my Department were agreed. In the event, the final 2002 allocation of &euro;337.6 million for primary and post-primary schools is over 33% greater than the multi-annual projection prior to the commencement of the Estimate and budget processes. Here again the Government has shown its deep commitment to our school building programme.</P>
    <P>There is no escaping the reality that, since coming into office in 1997, we have placed the highest priority on the improvement of school buildings and have consistently and substantially increased capital provision throughout the education sector. In effect, since 1998 until the end of the current year, we will have spent more than &euro;1.2 billion on educational infrastructure. In summary, in five years we have spent more than 13.5 times the capital allocated by those opposite for their last year in Government.</P>
    <P>What has this level of funding achieved? Again some comparisons demonstrate what we have delivered and achieved compared to what we inherited. For instance, in 1997 only 30 primary school projects were under way. In contrast, there are currently 84 primary school projects either in construction or at the tender phase with construction about to commence. At second level in 1997 <Col N="1218" /> only 12 projects valued over &euro;635,000 were sanctioned compared with a record 125 such projects in 2001 &ndash; ten times more than the previous Government sanctioned.</P>
    <P>Those primary school projects were major projects. Our achievements when all other grants are included are even more impressive. Last year I approved more than 1,350 capital grants for primary schools compared to 750 in 2000. The figure for 1997 was 420. The value of the grants approved by me in 2001 was &euro;126 million compared to &euro;57.5 million in the previous year. A total of 31 grants approved by me in 2001 exceeded &euro;1 million. I could go on, but let the House note that the record shows the quantum leap in funding and construction that has occurred during this Government's period in office.</P>

      <P>It leaves anything done by some of the parties opposite when last in office in the halfpenny place.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the current phase of our multi-annual programme which is designed to deal comprehensively with the needs of first and second level schools. The mere fact that the parties opposite accept and refer to the figure of 850 major school building projects is a tacit admission of the enormous progress the Government has made, and continues to make, towards improving the physical infrastructure of all primary and post-primary schools. However, the Deputies opposite have demonstrated their profound ignorance of the whole area of capital funding for schools in the very terms they so frequently use when referring to the building programme.</P>
      <P>Let me simplify the matter for them and put on the record of the House that there are not 850 major primary and post-primary school building projects awaiting sanction to proceed to construction. This figure refers to the number of projects currently undergoing architectural planning, the vast majority of which are not yet ready to proceed to construction and will not be ready to do so for some time yet.</P>

      <P>Architectural planning is under way and projects will continue to tender and construction as soon as possible under the expanded building programme. The notion, even if it were practical to do so, that one could somehow simultaneously release 850 major building projects into <Col N="1219" /> the construction market, with the consequent value for money implications due to inevitable tender inflation, is at best simplistic, if not daft. It demonstrates abysmal ignorance of construction market economics and, at worst, it is downright dishonest.</P>
      <P>Now, let me tackle head on the simplistic notion that there is some way of having all projects in a large scale programme move forward in tandem for instant simultaneous delivery. Despite attempts by the Opposition to simplify the issue, the process leading up to the provision of any major construction project on site can be quite complex. The starting date for construction on any major school building project depends on factors such as the size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, land acquisition, as necessary, sorting out title, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors. The funding profile for the project must then be assimilated into the aggregate funding profile for the programme in general and the actual funding provided on a year by year basis through voted expenditure.</P>
      <P>I will deal now with the procedures and systems employed by the planning and building unit of my Department to ensure that all projects proceed within the shortest time span possible. I find it shameful that the Deputies opposite, in the motion they have placed before this House, have attempted to malign the reputation of Department officials by calling for a radical overhaul of the building unit of my Department. In seeking to attack the performance of my officials they are ignoring the enormous increase in throughput of the unit, borne out by the facts and consequent increases in productivity in recent years.</P>

      <P>Among the efficiency measures achieved in 2001 was the introduction of new streamlined procedures for processing applications for grant aid for minor primary school building projects involving the provision of additional temporary accommodation and the upgrading or replacement of windows, roofs, mechanical and electrical systems and external areas. These streamlined procedures were introduced with the objective of devolving responsibility to the school management authorities to the greatest extent possible, consistent with achieving value for money and allowing the primary responsibility for administration and compliance to rest with each board of management. Since the introduction of these revised procedures, my Department has received very positive feedback from schools that have used this streamlined process. These schools have recognised the benefit of very significant reductions in the time frame from the date of their initial application to the date for undertaking improvement works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of these streamlined pro<Col N="1220" /> cedures has enabled my Department to sanction grant aid for a massive 1,350 minor primary school building projects, an increase of 600 from the previous year. Importantly, this is in addition to the devolved grant given to all schools on an annual basis for minor improvement works. My Department has already started to build on the success of these streamlined procedures in 2002 through a further devolution of authority and control of capital projects at primary schools. I have recently held discussions with my staff with a view to introducing further major developments in this regard. My officials are currently working on the details of how this scheme will operate, including those relating to value for money and accountability for public funds, to ensure a smooth implementation of this new scheme. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on this shortly.</P>
    <P>The focus of my Department's planning and building unit will increasingly be on ensuring quality, best practice and value for money through an evaluation and audit approach rather than a detailed involvement in individual projects. This will enable my Department to fulfil a more strategic, policy-oriented role in relation to school buildings. This changed role is facilitated by measures aimed at empowering schools in relation to direct control of minor projects and the greater use of external design teams and by supporting school authorities in their role as client on major projects. I appreciate what Deputy Creed said in this regard and I hope he will understand that I have been very busy trying to achieve all this and that I hope to be in a position to make an announcement about it shortly. When this sort of change is undertaken many things must be sorted out, both by the officials and by the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>In 2001, my Department's planning and building unit initiated the EU tender process for a pilot project involving organising and undertaking a comprehensive inventory of accommodation, including the production of site and building survey drawings and general building condition reports. The pilot project encompasses 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare and the resulting information will be compiled on a geographic information system database. It is envisaged that this inventory of school accommodation will be used for the long-term planning of capital provision, to enable priorities for capital provision to be identified, to enable the Department to identify schools with spare accommodation, for long-term planning for the provision of schools in any particular location and as an information resource for the public.</P>
    <P>The EU tender process for this project has been completed. The successful surveying teams commenced work in January 2002 and over the coming months each school in the pilot area will be visited by suitably qualified personnel who will assess and report on site conditions, space norms within the schools and the overall condition of each school. Ultimately, all the data accumulated will be stored electronically on the GIS database and will be available for reference. My Department is currently making the necessary prep<Col N="1221" /> arations for the use of Internet technology and for the publication of regular bulletins through which school communities, Members of the Oireachtas and others will be readily able to access up-to-date information on the status and progress of each building project. More general information, including details of the entire capital programme, will be available to the general public.</P>
    <P>PPPs are already being used to advance projects. In addition to our impressive programme of development, we have already taken the initiative in introducing public private partnerships to supplement our unprecedented schools building programme. In November 2001 I signed the contract for the first ever educational sector PPP project involving five second-level schools, catering for almost 3,500 pupils, at a cost of &euro;81.5 million. This money is in addition to the allocations in the Estimates. The Opposition does not need to suggest that we should move to a PPP approach or a design and build approach. The reality is that we have led the way. We have already delivered a school PPP bundle in a faster time than in other jurisdictions. This was an historic, ground-breaking pilot project. It gave massive new state of the art second level schools to Tubbercurry, with 675 pupils, Ballincollig, with 1,000, Clones, with 500, Dunmanway, with 700, and Shannon, with 600 pupils. We are now preparing the plans to invite tenders for further PPPs for primary and second level schools and to help meet the demand for state of the art PE halls.</P>
    <P>The programme has worked very well. The Department of Finance was impressed with it and it is fully behind our expansion of the programme. Many things had to be worked out during this pilot phase and quite a few builders decided not enter until they had seen how the pilot would go. It went well and now there are many people with an interest in the projects. These projects will contribute to better use of school buildings outside of school hours for adult and community use and for lifelong learning and will take away from school principals the burden of administration with regard to buildings, allowing them to concentrate on their core educational functions.</P>
    <P>Another major innovation in which we are currently involved is completion of a comprehensive plan for a single PPP to encompass all primary and second level schools in the Portlaoise area. This will involve new, state of the art buildings and widespread refurbishment. It is a new approach to take the whole of the Portlaoise area and deal with all the schools in it and everything that is needed. The movement of population, which is currently a problem there, will also be taken into account. Everything will be dealt with in one PPP. This is the first time ever that such a major integrated school building programme has been undertaken for any town or city in Ireland. The facilitation process for a second town, New Ross, has already begun. Facilitation means that people must come together, agree to work together and decide what the long-term plan should be for schools in the area.</P>
    <P>On the INTO list often referred to by the <Col N="1222" /> Opposition and in media comment, what I have to say is not intended to avoid the reality that some schools have substandard and inadequate accommodation. The scale of funding and the programme we are delivering is the most clear cut way of acknowledging what was neglected for years, namely, that there is much work to be done now and into the future. It is important that we are all clear on what exactly is involved and that all claims are grounded in fact and related to need. While I do not doubt the sincerity of the INTO, the criteria it uses in determining which schools are substandard are unclear and seem to have been applied in a very arbitrary fashion. It is not clear, from the information supplied by the INTO, who compiles the reports and the level of technical input, if any, involved in the assessments.</P>
    <P>Many of the specific issues raised by the INTO, such as hand washing and drying facilities, heating, replacement of windows and doors and water supply, should in these days be resolved through the devolved capital grant for primary schools. All primary schools now receive an annual capital grant which I increased this year to &euro;3,809 per school plus &euro;12.70 per pupil at a cost in excess of &euro;17.7 million per annum. This grant empowers schools to deal directly with such problems without any need to get approval from my Department. The vast majority of schools now deal with these minor works themselves and do so very effectively.</P>
    <P>The INTO and some elements in the media regularly refer to &ldquo;rat or mice infested primary schools&rdquo;. Rodent problems, as they would in any domestic, industrial or commercial setting, are more likely to arise if pest control policies are inadequate. The most structurally sound buildings can suffer rodent infestation, for example, through drains and sewers. It does not follow that rodent infestation, where it exists, requires the construction of a new building or that dealing with such a problem must await the construction of a new building. It may be colourful and headline grabbing to make such references but responsibility for dealing with such problems resides with local school managements and we provide them with annual funding on which they have total discretion. The vast majority of the schools listed by the INTO are relatively small buildings and, therefore, amenable to considerable improvement with the funds made available to them.</P>
    <P>My Department has serious concerns about the effectiveness of the devolved grant from a value for money point of view in these cases and has consequently decided to undertake a detailed expenditure review to determine exactly how these funds are being spent, particularly in the schools which appear to be unable to tackle these minor works themselves.</P>
    <P>My Department cannot accept the argument being advanced by the INTO that schools which do not adhere to the current Department of Education and Science planning guidelines are <Col N="1223" /> necessarily substandard. These guidelines were drawn up and adopted in January 2000 for the use of architectural design teams where new schools or extensions to existing schools are being planned for the future. My Department is setting new and higher standards and targets as part of a best practice agenda for school design and this will be implemented in all future works throughout the country. Based on these criteria, the INTO recently published a list of 73 schools which they regard as having substandard accommodation. Regular updates are received from the INTO, adding some schools and deleting others from the list. The planning and building unit has also initiated a series of regular meetings with the INTO to ensure that we have better information about priority projects.</P>
    <P>My Department's records show that, since 1996, over 165 schools have been highlighted by the INTO. Many of these schools have received substantial funding to carry out refurbishment work and to purchase temporary accommodation. Many other schools brought to my Department's attention by the INTO are among the primary school projects currently progressing through architectural planning. The Department must also fund the building of many new schools in developing areas where none exist and deal with the provision of new special education facilities.</P>
    <P>The primary school building programme must proceed on the basis of prioritising needs on a fair and rational basis and not on the basis of who shouts loudest or seeks to grab media attention. We must respond to the need for schools in rapidly developing areas, to the particular needs of schools in areas of social disadvantage, to the accommodation needs of schools catering for children with special needs and to the need for building works that facilitate development through amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the details of this year's programme with a specific emphasis on primary schools. Already this year, 84 major primary school projects are under construction or due on site in a matter of weeks at an ultimate cost of &euro;110 million. Work is proceeding on the acquisition of sites for a further 60 new primary schools. Architectural planning is continuing on over 450 major primary school building projects. Over 100 of these are at an advanced stage of the planning process at an estimated cost of &euro;170 million. Some of them will be ready to go to tender in the coming weeks and others will be ready later in the year. They will give rise to expenditure which will naturally spread over this year and next year. Work is proceeding and will continue to proceed within my Department on all these projects consistent with the progress that is made externally by design teams and in relation to local authority planning processes and all the other factors that influence the pace of progress.</P>
    <P>The level of capital funding in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million for primary buildings and &euro;184 million for post-primary schools, a total of &euro;337.6 million. <Col N="1224" /> We will add to this the projects to be undertaken through public private partnerships. While this funding will be used to meet the cost of projects already on site, new projects ready to go on site and new PPPs, it clearly cannot, and it is not intended to, address this year all the problems that have been identified. That will be the continuing challenge for next year.</P>
    <P>I am finalising for Government the details and shape of the programme as it is likely to develop through the year. It is my intention to make available to Deputies a list of school building projects currently in construction as well as major building projects in architectural planning as soon as possible, taking this year's Estimates, the budget allocation and PPPs into account. I will also announce details of projects that are ready to go to tender and others for which tenders have been received and where construction will commence in the coming months. Individual school authorities will be notified of indicative dates relevant to each stage.</P>
    <P>The education landscape does not stand still. The building programme must change and adapt to meet emerging curricular and other needs. Over the last five years, we have extended and dramatically improved the specifications for school buildings and ancillary accommodation to meet lower pupil-teacher ratios and the needs of children with disabilities, to provide new and refurbished science laboratories and PE halls and to provide an expanded choice of subjects and 3,500 extra teachers.</P>
    <P>The Government has invested significantly in education both in terms of human resources and programmes. The building programme has kept pace with those developments, ensuring that extra teachers are accommodated and new programmes can be delivered. We have done more on all fronts. We have surpassed anything achieved by any previous Government in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Ensuring schools meet the latest safety and technical standards is also essential. The removal of asbestos and the reduction of radon gas levels have been a priority. Already this week, I have announced funding for a major new programme that provides for dust extraction in specialist rooms in second level schools.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to addressing the historical deficit in educational infrastructure. We have allocated substantial extra funding in each of our budgets for school buildings. We have provided almost four times as much this year as the Opposition did when in Government. This level of commitment will continue into the foreseeable future. The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, recently gave a categorical assurance about our clear commitment to continue the work we have started and to build on the substantial progress that has already been made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met. I am proud to come to the House and stand over the record of the Government on spending on school building at all levels. No one <Col N="1225" /> has matched the performance of the Government in meeting the needs of our schools for modern, state-of-the-art buildings and facilities.</P>
    <P>There is still a substantial amount of work to be done, but let no one doubt the seriousness with which the Government approaches the schools building programme. We kick-started the programme from the paltry level at which it languished in 1997 when the rainbow coalition was in power to the record level of building and construction it has reached today. People can come to only one conclusion when they consider the ranting, hypocrisy and attempts the Opposition are making to create panic and undermine the sterling work of the Government's schools building programme. That conclusion is that there is a general election in the offing and they are clutching at straws.</P>

      <P>The image of a modern and dynamic Ireland presented by the Government rarely features footage of the conditions in which we continue to educate a great proportion of this country's children. It is difficult to believe that outdoor toilets, leaking roofs and substandard prefab classrooms remain a daily reality for pupils in both urban and rural areas. It is hard to accept that an Ireland which has been fortunate enough to enjoy the riches of the fastest growing economy in Europe allows her young to be educated in schools where there is no budget for repairing or replacing rotten windows, or for providing basic handwashing facilities. Conditions associated with early 20th century Ireland have been allowed to remain in schools up and down the country. Their persistence is a serious indictment of a Government that has shown itself to be prepared to spend the nation's surpluses on the whims of some of its Ministers rather than the real needs of our schoolchildren.</P>
      <P>A recent INTO survey of over 1,200 primary schools found that many were overcrowded and totally inadequate in terms of basis hygiene. Exactly 50% of schools lacked facilities for pupils with special needs. Only 24% of schools are lucky enough to be able to afford a small library and more than 62% of primary schools continue from day to day without even a principal's office from which the management of the school can be conducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation at second level is equally bad. There are currently over 850 applications for major capital works being processed by the Minister's Department. Time and again in this House the Minister has persistently refused to publish the long list of projects being dealt with. The Minister gave a clear commitment to me and to the Joint Committee on Education and Science on 4 December last, when pressed on the issue of <Col N="1226" /> the scandalous situation regarding school buildings, that he would publish that list. I checked the records last week and found that the Minister gave that commitment twice during that meeting, under pressure from Members. He said he would publish the full list of 850 schools and the stage that each one was at. That was what the Minister was asked to do. In his reply tonight, the Minister has done what he normally does in relation to parliamentary questions. He has denied an accusation that was not made and he has replied to a question that was not asked. The Minister was asked to supply the full list of 850 schools and the stage which each one was at. The Minister gave a commitment to do that &ndash; it is on the record &ndash; and we are still waiting for it. Shortly before Christmas, I put down a written parliamentary question to the Minister asking him to provide that information. The Minister replied that his officials were collecting it and would send it to me as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>It is now two months later. The Minister had that list at the committee meeting on 4 December. Two months after the PQ, there is still no sign of that information being made available.</P>
      <P>The point was made earlier that we ended up having to hold a tribunal into the beef industry because Ministers were economic with the truth and were not prepared to answer Dáil questions in an up-front and honest manner. The Minister is continuing that practice. The standard of his replies is atrocious. He shows scant regard for the rights of Members by the obfuscation in which he engages. Frequently, the Minister answers a different question to that asked. No matter how clearly Members word their questions and how straightforward they are, the Minister is incapable of giving a straightforward answer. He reads pages of waffle about the history of an issue. Nobody asked about history; Members asked straight questions and the Minister is incapable of answering.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a commitment on this matter which he has failed to honour. Over ten weeks after he gave that commitment, he still has not delivered on it. I call on him to honour that commitment and to provide Members with the full list of 850 schools and the stage at which each one is at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, the Minister is trying to hide; he is trying to play games with the future of many children in our schools and with staff who are struggling to survive in dilapidated buildings and conditions. The Minister seems to be hiding behind bureaucracy and the officials in his Department, and he is running away from his responsibility to the thousands of pupils, staff and parents. However, we all know that there is an election coming up in a couple of months and the Minister has a political motivation for guarding the information he has and for failing to notify <Col N="1227" /> schools of this year's allocation and whether or not they are getting the go-ahead&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you. The allocation made in the Estimates was so pathetic &ndash; it was less than last year's when inflation is taken into consideration &ndash; that an additional amount was provided in the budget. That is no great shakes and will not go anywhere close to meeting existing needs. It is clear that the Minister is holding on to this information and is delaying the announcement that would normally have been made at this stage in the year, purely for political reasons. He is leaving those schools hanging, not knowing what the future has in store for them or whether they will be able to go ahead with improvements this year, next year or the following year.</P>
      <P>An example from my constituency is St. Canice's boys national school which was in a deplorable condition. The situation was incredible. Pupils had to wear their coats all day long in the school because the heating was so poor and the windows so draughty. Conditions were Dickensian. The school was told this year to bring in temporary prefabs to allow the building to go ahead. The whole school moved into temporary accommodation yet it is still waiting to find out from the Minister whether the project is going ahead this year. It is not fair to lead people up the garden path like that. The Minister is playing games with students and with limited schooldays. People have been left in limbo.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Minister wants to hold onto announcements of good news until the election is closer so he can look for a political dividend from those announcements. What about the other announcements such as those to schools which will not be getting the go-ahead this year? How many schools will be left waiting for the call from their local Fianna Fáil Deputy? I guarantee that those Deputies will not be ringing with the bad news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" />The Minister should publish the list this week. We have waited ten weeks for it despite the Minister having all the necessary information. Schools should know exactly where they stand. In recent years, school principals have found it nearly impossible to get information about the status of the applications for building work in their schools. This is principally because the Minister for Education and Science does not want to tell the truth and admit his fundamental failure to deal with the ever-lengthening list of applications in his Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science is not the only Cabinet member guilty of political misinformation, filibuster and bluff on this issue. The much heralded announcement by the Taoiseach a few weeks back regarding substandard schools has turned out to be a total non-event and has been a bitter disappointment to teachers and parents throughout the country. The public were told to expect an announcement of the biggest ever building programme. Once again, a Government announcement has failed to live up to the pre-event PR spin. Instead of firm proposals for a refurbishment programme, what we got from the Taoiseach was a woolly promise for another survey without the commitment of a single extra euro to rectify the appalling substandard conditions in many schools.</P>
    <P>This announcement from the Taoiseach has joined the health strategy in the litany of preelection gimmicks launched by this over-spun Government in recent times.</P>
    <P>Given the huge budget surpluses of recent years, the Government's failure to meet the legitimate demands of school communities will stand as a serious indictment of its term of office and a bitter disappointment to many communities which urgently need improved educational facilities.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, but, unfortunately, time is very short. Rathmore, Glens in Dingle, Ballyferriter, Milltown and Anabhlaha are just five of the worst schools in south Kerry. They are but a small example of the list of schools which currently have applications before the Department of Education and Science and are waiting for answers to the following questions: when will the roof stop leaking? When will we have our new sports hall? When will we have our general purposes room? When will the rotting windows be replaced? When will the remedial and resource teachers have facilities? </P>
      <P>I could list many more schools in the constituency of Kerry South which are awaiting movement from the Department on their applications for renovation, extension or upgrading, but I cannot list all of them because, as my colleague, Deputy Shortall, said, the Minister has refused to publish the full information. He has refused time and again in the House to tell Members which schools have applied for funding, what stage their applications are at and when it is envisaged that the work will be completed or even started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" />Over the past five years I have stood up in this House to seek answers to the same questions about repairs and renovations to schools in my constituency. I have consistently raised the case of Rathmore national school, for example, on the adjournment and at every other opportunity. To this day, there are prefabs in which the classrooms are located and which are surrounded by rubble and mortar as the school authorities await the construction of a new school which the people of Rathmore were promised by my constituency colleagues before the last general election. Conditions are so bad that the staff and pupils had to walk out for one day in protest to the shame of the Minister and his parliamentary colleagues in south Kerry, among whom I include their Independent Fianna Fáil colleague who has made enough noise about the matter in my constituency over the past five years, but who, I am afraid, has delivered nothing.</P>
    <P>I also mention Ballyferriter national school in which children with special needs are taught in the principal's tiny office and have their nappies changed on a cold toilet floor. I further mention the expanding Milltown national school which has been waiting for years for the commencement of a new sports hall, extension and new classrooms. Anabhlaha national school submitted an application for a general purposes room to the Department in 1996 and is still waiting.</P>
    <P>Over the last five years we have heard rhetoric about the amount of money spent by the Department. The last Labour Party Minister for Education and Science, my colleague, Niamh Breathnach, did not treat my constituency colleagues with such disdain nor did she keep any pupils in prefabs while their schools were being built. She built seven new schools in the constituency of Kerry South during her tenure. That is an excellent record when set against that of the Minister who with the Government will be long remembered as having presided over a fundamental failure to invest in our children through the education system. The Government has had more resources at its disposal than any other Government in the history of the State, but at the end of its term of office 850 schools have applications before the Department which do not know the status of their applications because the Minister will not tell them. He repeatedly refuses to publish this information. I ask him to do one thing before he leaves office, that is, to please publish the list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the motion. The Government will be remembered as the Administration which had unprecedented resources at its disposal, but which failed to deliver on the whole range of problems facing the people. No other Government had the options open to the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition and no other delivered so little. Hospital and housing waiting lists are longer than when it came to <Col N="1230" /> power. Traffic and transport problems are also worse, as is the condition of many schools.</P>
      <P>When the findings of the INTO survey of 75 primary schools were published late last year, they confirmed what many parents, teachers, pupils and public representatives already knew, that is, that the condition of so many schools had been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that there was a real crisis. Let us remember what the INTO survey found. Of the 75 schools surveyed over 66% have inadequate toilet facilities; 50% have inadequate hand-washing or drying facilities; 40% do not have an adequate heating system; 43% have either no drinking water or water unfit to drink; 47% have rotten windows or doors; and 71% have an inadequate or unsafe school yard. The survey further found that most do not have basic facilities such as a general purposes room, a principal's office, staff rooms or rooms in which children needing extra teaching tuition can be taught by the learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>Every public representative could identify further schools in his or her constituency not covered in the INTO survey but where conditions are almost as bad. The INTO survey dealt with primary schools only. There are many second level schools in which teachers work and pupils are taught in similarly unacceptable conditions.</P>
      <P>The dismissive attitude of the Government in the face of such conditions almost defies belief. Not a day goes by without another newspaper story of yet another school where the parents and teachers have reached the end of their tether. In January we were all told to expect a major announcement from the Taoiseach. The Government spin doctors got to work and there were hints of an announcement of what would be the biggest ever rebuilding programme which would bring every school up to European standards. Some &euro;335 million was going to be provided in the first year alone. That was certainly another case of a Government announcement failing to live up to the pre-event public relations spin. Instead of firm proposals for a rebuilding programme, all we got was the promise of another survey, without the commitment of a single extra euro to rectify the dreadful substandard conditions in many schools. We already know the condition of schools from the INTO survey and other studies. We do not need another survey. What we need is a commitment of funds and the approval of projects which, in many cases, have already been submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the constituencies of other speakers, there are many schools in my constituency waiting for funding to provide better facilities for students and teachers, including Ballymore national school, St. Patrick's national school, Athy, Scoil Diarmada, Castledermot, Ballyshannon national school and Curragh post-primary school. In regard to Scoil Diarmada, I remember in 1953 when we moved from the hovel which was the school at the time to the present school, we thought it was a marvellous achievement that we had a new school. Unfortunately, it has now <Col N="1231" /> become substandard. There are no facilities for PE teaching, remedial teachers and the principal. Every room in the school is smaller than the size determined by the Department, yet the Office of Public Works is not in a position to buy even the field necessary to initiate the provision of a new school. The same applies to Ballyshannon national school where the children are housed in prefabs. This is totally unacceptable in the modern era of education.</P>
    <P>We talk about the Celtic tiger, which we are letting pass by its most vital asset, the children of the future, for which the Minister is responsible. He is also responsible for providing the House with a list in order that we can give those children some hope. We must give some hope to future generations by providing proper facilities for educational purposes. I ask that the Minister provide the list as soon as possible. It would not be a major undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if the bad old days of company closures are back with a bang. I have read of many such closures around the country over the past six or 12 months and felt that the Celtic tiger was faltering in its gallop. Now that the bad results have hit close to home in Bandon, I realise that the Celtic tiger has become lame and has run out of steam. It is really only when a closure of that order hits close to home that one fully appreciates its devastating consequences.</P>
      <P>The closure of the Alcatel Software Centre in Bandon is a bad blow for the country because it was a unique software centre. It is a major disaster for the Bandon area. A total of 75 jobs have been lost. These are not ordinary jobs, but highly-skilled jobs in software engineering. This is a huge blow to the local economy in Bandon. On the day these jobs were lost, 15 more were lost in Shannon, and it was announced that 200 Esat workers would be laid off around the country. My particular concern is for my own area, Bandon. What we are losing there is a skilled workforce of software engineers. I do not want to see that skilled workforce scattered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two possibilities. The first is the introduction of a project to absorb that highly-skilled workforce. I have already spoken to the IDA about that. I have also spoken to the management of the company. In fairness to the company, it indicated in its statement that it would assist employees affected by the closure of the software centre in whatever manner possible in sourcing alternative employment. In my further discussions with the management, they made it clear that from the point of view of the factory space, and obviously not taking on board direct competition, they would be very happy to provide that factory space for an alternative enterprise <Col N="1232" /> which would absorb that skilled workforce. We have the factory space, the skilled workforce, and the good will of the company. I want the Government and its agencies to ensure if at all possible that the window of opportunity in that regard will be used.</P>
    <P>The other possibility is that the group itself might develop a project. I understand that discussions are under way between some of the members of that skilled and highly-trained workforce. If such a project should emerge from within the group, I want to ensure, whether through Forfás or any other State agency, that the maximum support is given to bringing such a project to fruition in Bandon.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are problems worldwide in the telecommunications sector. We can only look at our own situation and the difficulties that arise where they are of our own making or where the solution is in our hands. In a general sense the deregulation process in Ireland is not working fully and properly. There has been no new investment in the domestic telecommunications industry in recent times. We are far behind the rest of the world in some aspects. There has been no deployment of the DSL, that is the digital subscriber line, other than trials. I call on this Government, for whatever time is left to it, to take the industry by the scruff of the neck in that general sense and try to stimulate a new approach. Otherwise the bad news of Bandon will be replicated nationwide.</P>
    <P>My particular concern tonight is the project in Bandon. I have mentioned two possibilities for the use of that skilled workforce. I want that workforce marketed. I want the factory space and the skilled workforce to be presented internationally so that we can, if possible, attract international mobile investment. Alternatively, will the Government support the development of a project by the workforce? There is a window of opportunity. The workforce will not be laid off except on a phased basis between May and September. Let us use that window of opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I fully share the Deputy's concern and disappointment over the recent decision by Alcatel to close its Software Development Centre in Bandon.</P>
      <P>Alcatel established its original operations in Ireland to supply digital exchange equipment to Eircom. The Bandon operation was subsequently established in 1982 to manufacture and install switching equipment. By 1985, with IDA grant assistance, Alcatel established its Software Development Centre. The company reached its target of 25 employees and, in 1987, an expansion was agreed to bring employment up to 56 people. The centre continued to expand and, having peaked at 86 people, it employed 75 software developers in January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Working exclusively for its parent company in France, Alcatel Bandon's work concentrated on developing home location register technology, a software roaming tool. Due to restructuring <Col N="1233" /> within Alcatel, this work will now be moved to France. Staff were informed of the decision on Friday last, 15 February 2002. Redundancies will take effect on a phased basis from May 2002 and are due to be completed by September 2002.</P>
    <P>Alcatel's network hardware installation business will be unaffected. While no manufacturing is now carried out in Ireland, 85 people are employed covering installation of equipment for fixed line and wireless networks for customers that include Eircom, Vodafone, Esat-BT and Chorus. Forty-eight of the staff are located in Bandon while the remaining are based at Citywest in Dublin or involved in installation around Ireland.</P>
    <P>The employees affected by the closure announcement comprise a significant pool of experienced software personnel and IDA Ireland will now work to find a suitable outlet for this expertise. In addition, FÁS was in contact with the company yesterday to advise on the full range of support services it could offer employees including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has also been in contact with the management of Alcatel to arrange a presentation to selected staff on the range of supports available to those wishing to start their own business. A meeting with Alcatel management will take place on 22 February 2002 to agree the timing and content of this presentation.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to promote the National Software Centre in Mahon, Cork city, and in particular the associated incubator space, as a location for start-up companies in the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector. This may particularly suit Alcatel employees, given their ICT skills.</P>
    <P>The fifth south west region graduate enterprise programme, a high-support scheme for graduates wishing to start their own business funded by the Department of Education and Science, has begun. Enterprise Ireland will provide feasibility study support for any suitable Alcatel employee who wishes to join this programme, even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to work with the west Cork technology task force to promote the West Cork Business and Technology Park, Clonakilty as part of their &ldquo;Into the Regions&rdquo; strategy. It should be noted that this park will have full high-speed broadband access by the end of April next. Over the past four years there has been an unprecedented growth in employment in IDA Ireland assisted overseas companies in both Cork city and county.</P>
    <P>Permanent employment grew from 13,857 people in 1998 to 18,461 people in 2001. This represents an increase in employment of 4,604 people &ndash; a growth in employment of over 33%. This growth was achieved by concentrating on three main sectors as follows: chemicals, pharmaceuticals and health care; information and communication technologies; and international traded services. It should be noted that not all of these new jobs were provided by new inward investment. A strong performance by overseas <Col N="1234" /> industries already established in Cork contributed 2,892, almost 63%, of these jobs. This indicates a high satisfaction ratio with the economy and the Cork area in particular as a base for investment and a magnet for the attraction of further investment in the future.</P>
    <P>Critical to the growth of these sectors is the provision of qualified and highly skilled people. The educational institutions in Cork have responded well to these demands and their contribution to industrial and commercial success is highly regarded and acknowledged. Investment in Cork is supported through the co-operation of a large number of public and private organisations &ndash; local authorities, semi-State bodies, utility providers, telecommunications providers, shipping, transport, airport, trades unions, professional services etc. &ndash; all of which are available to smooth the path for new and existing investors. This spirit of co-operation and assistance in Cork is key to IDA Ireland's efforts to attract overseas investment to the area. During the lifetime of this Government, the number of people employed in software in Ireland and the gross value of the industry have doubled and we lead the world, ahead of the United States, in software products and services. We are proud of that and know that the workers in Alcatel in Bandon are highly skilled people. I will reinforce with State agencies the importance of giving every possible support to these people to ensure we can create alternative opportunities for them, either in a new project or in individual opportunities for them as skilled people.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Agency will continue to market County Cork for investment and will do its utmost to assist those workers losing their jobs to find alternative employment as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a straightforward request for the Minister to allow the extension of St. Coleman's National School, Clara, County Kilkenny. The building unit in the Department has already approved detailed design and contract documents for the project and it awaits the green light to allow it proceed to tender.</P>
      <P>This school is close to Kilkenny City, in a developing area with many new houses. Unfortunately, although there have been numerous requests for places for pupils, the school cannot accept them due to the restrictions in the classrooms and the facilities available to students and teachers. Five years ago there were 130 pupils and five teachers in the school. There are now 171 pupils. In that period the number of teachers has increased from five to six &ndash; only one extra teacher. Unusually, the teaching principle has the biggest class of 32 children, with half of the fifth class and the entire sixth class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clara national school has been sanctioned for a major extension since 2000. As well as the 171 pupils and six teachers, there is a shared learning support teacher, a part-time resource teacher, a classroom assistant and a caretaker. There is no room to employ a secretary. The accommodation <Col N="1235" /> is alarming and unsuited to the modern needs of primary schools. One classroom is also used as a lunchroom and sick bay. There is no staff room or adequate facilities for visiting medical personnel and all classrooms are below the minimum size stipulated by the Department of Education and Science, and, therefore, are hazards to health and safety. Recently the school bought some furniture but when it was delivered, it was impossible to install it because of the size of the classrooms. The resource teacher sometimes has to teach pupils in the corridor when the learning support teacher is in the school.</P>
    <P>Conditions in the school are atrocious for both staff and students. The parents and the board of management are annoyed about this and asked me to bring their protest to the floor of the House in the hope that the Minister will address the situation. The facts speak for themselves. The details are on file in the Department and have been the subject of many parliamentary questions, representations by politicians and numerous contacts by the board of management with the Department of Education and Science. The chairman has been told repeatedly that it is expected that a decision will be made in the near future. Where it has been indicated that a project can proceed to tender, we should not have to wait around &ndash; we should prioritise.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure this project proceeds to tender stage and we can convey that news to the excellent staff and students of St. Coleman's National School, Clara.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Aylward has given me the opportunity to outline the Department's position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at St. Coleman's National School, Clara, County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>At present this school is staffed by a principal, five mainstream classroom teachers and a shared learning support teacher. The enrolment, as of 30 September 2001, is 171. Current facilities at the school comprise five permanent classrooms, a general purpose room, a staff room, a servery, cloakrooms and toilets. The school authorities applied to the Department for permanent accommodation to replace the existing classrooms and for the provision of additional ancillary accommodation. Architectural planning for a building project at this school has been completed.</P>
      <P>The allocation for primary school buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, a record level of funding that demonstrates this Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools &ndash; such as St. Coleman's National School &ndash; under the expanded school building programme.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Colem<Col N="1236" /> an's National School and I assure the House that the building project at this school will proceed to tender as soon as possible under the Government's expanded building programme.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Aylward's unique contribution as a Minister of State in the Department when he assisted schools and other projects throughout the State. I will bring the case he has made to the attention of our senior officials and I hope we will be able to bring this project to a positive conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the serious overcrowding at Clonakilty Community College. When will the Minister approve finance for the extension of the college to alleviate the serious overcrowding and allow the project to go to tender?</P>
      <P>Clonakilty Community College was completed and opened in 1980 to accommodate 430 students. There are now 570 students and the numbers are growing with the inclusion of Gaelscoil students this year and next year. That will swell the number of students by 200, making a projected school roll of 800 students by 2004. The presence of refugee students and the growing demand for teaching other languages add to the demands on the college for immediate expansion.</P>
      <P>When the school was built 25 years ago, it was planned that it would accommodate a maximum of 430 students. A staff room was designed to cater for 25 teachers. There are now 40 teachers on staff and the room is no longer suitable. The toilet facilities are totally inadequate and there is no office space for the teachers.</P>
      <P>The school caters for almost 600 students using two buildings, one on either side of Clonakilty. That is not satisfactory and adds immensely to the workload of the teachers concerned as they have to travel half a mile between either centre.</P>
      <P>All these problems have serious implications for the health and safety of the students and teachers. The school authorities want to know when the Minister will sanction plans for the extension of the college. When will he appoint a design team? The schedule of overall accommodation plans was agreed with the Department long ago. The school is entitled to an extra 1,600 square metres of accommodation.</P>
      <P>I want action, not pious words, from the Minister on this important issue. I urge the Minister to take this matter into consideration, particularly in the home town of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will provide a glimmer of hope for Clonakilty community college which is completely overcrowded. An urgent remedy is required for this serious situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also acknowledge the fact that Deputy Sheehan regards him as one of the best Ministers that has ever served in that portfolio. Since coming into office in 1997, the Government has consistently and substantially provided for educational infrastructure. In 1997, a total sum of &euro;91.7 million was available for first and second level infrastructure. The corresponding figure for the current year is in excess of &euro;335 million, or almost four times as much as was allocated in 1997. Due to the greatly increased level of investment in first and second level school buildings since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>I wish to give some background information in connection with this particular school. County Cork Vocational Education Committee made an application for additional permanent accommodation, along with the refurbishment of existing accommodation, in 2000. The Department's planning section advised me that any future extension should cater for a long-term enrolment of 550 pupils in a growing area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy:</NameTxt>
      <P>A schedule of overall accommodation to cater for a long-term enrolment of 550 pupils was drawn up in late 2000. In early 2001, officials from the Department visited the school and completed a revised schedule of overall accommodation, a schedule of suggested future use of existing accommodation and a schedule of residual accommodation. These schedules were forwarded to the VEC in April last and were accepted by it last September.</P>
      <P>The Department's post-primary building unit has agreed, in principle, to the extension and refurbishment of Clonakilty Community College. However, a decision to appoint a design team for this project has yet to be made and it will be made as soon as possible. All the options for the delivery of modern classroom accommodation, as outlined, will be considered following the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning for this major building project.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, County Cork VEC has applied for funding towards the provision of three temporary classrooms at the college. Officials of the Department of Education and Science are currently examining this recent application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, who will reply to the debate. On 29 May 2001, I tabled an Adjournment debate matter on a similar issue and I received confirmation from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that Cork County Council has suffered historically from low funding levels during the lifetime of the Government. We have been at the bottom of the league table in every year that the Government has been in office. I tabled parliamentary Question No. 260 on Tuesday, 5 February 2002, in which the Minister again published in league table format the levels of funding received by each local authority. It is true that Cork County Council has made progress; it is no longer bottom of the league table, but second last. Cork County Council will receive &euro;3,184 per kilometre in 2002, compared to Roscommon at the bottom which will receive &euro;3,138. That is a shocking indictment of the Minister's contribution to the welfare of the citizens of Cork, particularly the motorists who are our constituents.</P>
      <P>A fair and equitable comparison should be drawn between Cork County Council and Kildare County Council because the latter has heavy volumes of commuter traffic, intensive agriculture and associated heavy traffic, large urban centres and a suburban commuter belt. It is similar to County Cork and, in particular, the south Cork area. In this league table, Kildare County Council received &euro;10,104 per kilometre of non-national road, to use the Department's jargon. Yet, Cork County Council received less than one third of that figure. I find it hard to draw any conclusion other than that the Minister has been pushed around in his Department. He has been unable to deliver. He has received scant support from his colleagues in Cork and, in particular, from his two Cabinet colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh.</P>
      <P>Arising from parliamentary questions on 10 May 2001, the Cork county manager, Mr. Maurice Maloney, put his name to a report outlining the historical under-funding of roads in Cork. Our allocation in 2001 was £26.98 million. He made the point that if we had received the average funding that County Kildare got per kilometre, we would have received £109 million. If we had received the national average, we would have got £34.8 million. If we had received what Monaghan County Council got per kilometre, we would have received £46.4 million. If we had received what the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey's county of Meath got, we would have received £55.6 million. I do not want to hear any political claptrap about what was allocated five years ago and what is being allocated now.</P>

      <P>Motorists in Cork deserve better than the scant defence that they are getting 7% more than last year; so is everybody else, but we are at the bottom of the league table. In last year's contribution I made the point that this would be a key election issue. The Minister knows that because he represents part of the Blarney area under Cork County Council which has some of the worst roads in the county. The Minister should be ashamed to be represent the constituency with that record.</P>

      <P>It is appalling. Motorists are suffering enormously. The national car test was introduced, with which I agree, but it has become a money-making racket for those who operate it because people cannot keep their cars in an acceptable condition on sub-standard roads. We have sat back for too long. At least the county manager is beginning to flex his muscles, but nobody is listening at an official level in the Minister's Department or at a political level. The allocation as outlined in the reply to parliamentary Question No. 260 on 5 February 2002 calls into question the Minister's capacity to deliver for the constituents he represents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Before turning to the specific issue raised in relation to Cork County Council, I wish to avail of this opportunity to outline the progress being made in relation to the significant resourcing of non-national roads. On 18 January this year, a record provision for non-national roads of &euro;438.46 million was announced for 2002. This represents an increase of 9.4% on the 2001 outturn and a doubling of the original 1997 allocation of over &euro;219 million. In making this provision the Government was again delivering, as it had in previous years, on its commitment to ensure an adequate financial base for the non-national roads programme.</P>
      <P>This has been copperfastened by the national development plan which commits expenditure of &euro;2.43 billion in the period to 2006, channelled through the regional operational programmes of the BMW and southern and eastern regional assemblies. This means that there will be significant expenditure on non-national roads in each of the years covered by the NDP. Under the plan, State grant expenditure in the period 2000-2002 was profiled at &euro;1.04 billion. We will exceed this profile, spending &euro;1.184 billion in this period. We will continue to invest heavily in non-national roads over the lifetime of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" />In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, Cork County Council's non-national road grant allocation in 2002 is &euro;36.87 million. This represents an increase of 10% on the 2001 outturn of &euro;33.39 million and an increase of 84% on the council's initial 1997 allocation of over &euro;20 million. This is the highest allocation countrywide by some &euro;11.7 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <P>Will the Minister of State yield on a point of order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork County Council's 2001 submission seeking additional funding for non-national roads was examined in the Department and taken into account in determining the council's non-national roads grant allocation for 2002. Within this allocation for 2002, Cork County Council will receive grants of &euro;3.23 million for discretionary maintenance, &euro;2.73 million for discretionary improvement, &euro;18.50 million for restoration improvement and &euro;6.65 million for restoration maintenance, which represent increases respectively of 105%, 66%, 93% and 74% on the council's 1997 allocation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Cork County Council was one of ten county councils selected for special grant aid to support housing and other related developments. Under this grant scheme the Government is committed to providing Exchequer funding of over &euro;6.35 million to Cork County Council over the period 2001 to 2004 for road infrastructure, to support housing and other related developments, of which &euro;330,000 was allocated in 2002.</P>
      <P>In addition, Cork County Council have indicated they intend spending over &euro;14.7 million from their own resources on non-national roads in 2002. This in effect means that the council in all will have almost &euro;52 million available to them in 2002 for non-national roads, the highest figure of any county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme is being reviewed by an interdepartmental group which is being chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Officials from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my Department are also represented on the group. I have not received the final report and recommendations of the review group but its work is at an advanced stage. The House can be assured that the report will be published once the deliberative process is fully completed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the work of the review group is complex. As part of its deliberations, the group has heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days and has received over 260 written submissions from interested parties. While definitions of disability vary, I have been informed that there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include people with less severe medical conditions than those which are covered by the scheme and persons with medical conditions which are not covered by it. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme. Many factors must be taken into account by the review group and many interests balanced. This work and analysis takes time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said in the past, I appreciate the diffi<Col N="1242" /> culties which people who suffer from some form or other of physical disability face in coping with everyday life. Any proposals &ndash; whether to widen the scope of the scheme or otherwise &ndash; which may emanate from the review group will receive full consideration.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether IT programmes to ensure traceability of transactions should be made mandatory, in view of the scandal involving international financial transactions (details supplied); and whether this traceability would make a Tobin tax feasible.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Banks involved in foreign exchange trading have various risk management controls to monitor their activities. Appropriate IT systems are an essential tool in achieving the goal of risk management. I have no doubt that all financial institutions with substantial treasury management exposures will be looking, among other areas, at their IT systems. Clearly IT systems, which automate the processes of control and reduce manual interventions, have an increasing part to play but it would be very easy to underestimate the tasks concerned. IT systems development would not, of itself, eliminate the risk of fraud; as even in the modern world, many tasks require a human element.</P>
      <P>In carrying out its prudential and systemic supervisory functions in relation to credit institutions, the Central Bank sets down various rules designed to ensure their continued solvency and liquidity. It also is concerned to ensure that there are adequate systems of internal control. It is a matter for the Central Bank, in exercising its day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of banks, to decide the standards it will apply to banks.</P>
      <P>In the light of recent events, the Central Bank will be reporting to me on whether any changes to regulatory provisions governing banking supervision may be appropriate. These could possibly include recommendations for increased statutory powers. I will review the situation when I see the bank's report.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's query concerning the Tobin tax, difficulties relating to practical implementation of the tax are not the only issue. There are many questions arising in relation to its likely effectiveness in addressing destabilising currency speculation, which was the primary rationale of the original proposal, and how it might affect the sound operation of financial markets. I am not convinced that the link that has been made between the revenue such a tax could, in principle, raise and the much wider issue of assisting the development of the world's most impoverished countries. It would not appear that the traceability issue raised by the Deputy would be a factor of any significance when set against the numerous practical and other problems that arise in relation to the proposal.  </P>

      <P>The marine laboratories are being relocated to Oranmore, County Galway to a site previously occupied by Bord Iascaigh Mhara. The estimated construction cost of the new laboratories in Galway is &euro;39.4 million, or £31 million, including inflation, fees and VAT.</P>

The criteria under which people can claim are: death; serious injury; homelessness; damage to home; loss of income; and extreme hardship. On receipt of applications, the Irish Red Cross assessors will make appointments to meet the applicants. Assessments have already started in some areas.</P>
      <P>The Irish Red Cross has tremendous professional expertise in administering humanitarian aid schemes and is confident that all applications will be processed and payments made within eight weeks of receipt of application.

      <P>In relation to Ireland's Kyoto obligations for greenhouse emissions, the national climate change strategy provides a framework for achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions in the most efficient and equitable manner, while continuing to support economic growth and preparing Ireland for the more ambitious commitments that will be required after 2012. One of the measures put forward in the strategy in relation to the energy sector is the expansion of renewable energy generation.</P>
      <P>There are different methods of encouraging renewable energy. For instance, in Finance Act, 1998, I provided for corporate tax relief for investments made over a three year period in renewable energy projects that were certified by the Minister for Public Enterprise. Relief may be obtained on up to 50% of all capital expenditure, excluding land, net of grants, or £7.5 million for a single project, whichever is the lesser. Other countries use a variety of methods in regard to reducing greenhouse emissions, for example through grants/subsidies, pricing or compulsory purchase mechanisms in regard to renewable energy generation. Very few countries provide for personal income tax incentives.</P>

      <P>Inflation, as measured by changes in the consumer price index, averaged 4.9% in 2001. It is expected that inflation will moderate over the course of this year and the current forecast, as published in the stability programme December 2001 update, is for an average CPI inflation rate of 4.2% in 2002. It is crucial for the competitiveness of the economy that the inflation rate continues to moderate and that costs throughout the economy evolve in a sustainable manner during the period.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated before in replying to Dáil questions regarding, <i>inter alia</i>, the likely cost of the scheme, it is difficult to estimate the Exchequer cost of the SSIA scheme because of its very nature &ndash; the size of the Exchequer contribution will depend on take-up by participants in the scheme. The Exchequer cost of the first nine months of operation is &euro;107.4 million but it should be noted that the figure for January included in the total is provisional. It is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer in 2002 would be of the order of &euro;250 million.</P>

      <P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, as provided for by the Finance Act, 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders will be the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001.</P>
      <P>Eight applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 11 financial institutions. One other application is pending. I am advised by the commissioners that work is currently progressing in relation to other financial institutions and that further applications to the High Court will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>Work has already commenced as regards taxpayers who held bogus non-resident accounts which were detected in the course of the DIRT look-back audits of financial institutions in 1999 and 2000 and did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001. Revenue expect that information under court orders will become available on a phased basis commencing shortly.</P>
      <P>While it is clear that Revenue is facing a long programme of investigations over a number of years, the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that significant progress is being made in this new phase of the investigations. Deputies will recall that the earlier voluntary disclosure phase resulted in receipts of £179 million, or &euro;227 million, for the Exchequer.</P>

      <Col N="1249" />The national climate change strategy provides a framework for achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions in the most efficient and equitable manner while continuing to support economic growth and to prepare Ireland for the more ambitious commitments that will be required after 2012.</P>
    <P>As provided for in the strategy, a cross-departmental climate change team has been established to ensure its early implementation. The team is chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A number of support groups have also been established to assist the team including an economic analysis sub-group. Work is ongoing. Taxation issues arising from the work of the climate change team are considered by the tax strategy group which is chaired by an official from my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have said in the past, taxation can play a part in attaining environmental goals. As Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that tax measures take into account the effect on Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided to reorganise the structure of financial services regulation last year. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has, for some months, been working on the complex task of preparing the text of the legislation. My departmental officials continue to work closely with that office to finalise a text.

The total amount involved is in the region of &euro;127,000. It would not be appropriate, or indeed possible, for me to give details of these accounts. Under the relevant EU regulations, such information is exchanged between the competent authorities and the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>These accounts have been frozen by the financial institutions on the basis of Council Regulation No. 467/2001 dated 6 March 2001. This regulations provides for the freezing of funds and other financial resources of the Taliban of Afghanistan. It is directly applicable in Ireland and has the force of law here. This regulation, which has been amended by the EU Commission on six occasions since September 2001, lists the entities and individuals whose financial resources must be targeted.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank, as one of the relevant competent authorities here for implementing these regulations, has been maintaining close contacts with financial and other relevant bodies on this matter. Statutory Instruments under Irish law provide for compliance with these regulations and for penalties if they are breached. In addition to the above, towards the end of last year the Council of the European Union adopted two new positions and a new regulation aimed at combating terrorism and its financing.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the call by the Irish Brokers Association to reconsider a rule requiring members to seek authorised advisor status from the Central Bank, if his attention has further been drawn to difficulties encountered by IBA members in complying with the new regulatory regime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Brokers Association is a representative body for insurance brokers in Ireland. At its AGM in Kilkenny in May 2001, the IBA's members passed a motion to the effect that membership of the organisation should be confined to those who hold authorised advisor status or its equivalent. The authorised advisor category was introduced by the Central Bank following consultation with insurance industry representatives. Authorised advisors must give broad based advice to their clients including advice in relation to the products of product producers, or insurers, from whom they do not hold an appointment in writing. Therefore, authorised advisors must have a broad knowledge of the market and cannot concentrate on products from just a few insurance companies, thereby ensuring their independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IBA's AGM took place during the period of consultation on the regulatory framework for insurance intermediaries initiated by the Central Bank. The regulatory framework agreed upon following that consultation process was not finalised until some time after the IBA's AGM when the Central Bank published various codes of conduct, or handbooks, for all insurance intermediaries. Arising from the publication of these handbooks, many IBA members felt that they might not meet the requirements for authorised advisor status. Some of them decided to seek classification as restricted intermediaries. Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, restricted intermediaries may only give advice in relation to the products of insurers from whom they hold an appointment in writing. In deciding to opt for restricted intermediary status, some IBA members were putting themselves at variance <Col N="1252" /> with the membership criterion established by the May 2001 AGM resolution. Clearly, this was an issue for the IBA to address.</P>
    <P>An emergency general meeting of the IBA was held on 10 January to discuss a motion to permit restricted intermediaries to be members of the IBA. Although a large majority or 69% of the membership voted in favour of the motion, this fell short of the majority of 75% required to overturn the earlier motion. It is up to brokers to decide whether they want to be classified as authorised advisors or restricted intermediaries. As I have already indicated, the IBA's membership criteria is a matter for that organisation and I have no function in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some brokers were unable or unwilling to meet the requirements set down in the Central Bank's handbooks. There will have been many reasons these brokers did not pursue the issue of authorisation with the Central Bank. For example, it may have been because they were tied agents, working exclusively for one insurance company. Possibly, the amount of commission being earned may have made meeting the requirements set down in the handbooks an unattractive proposition. There may be other reasons brokers cease to trade but I would not like to speculate further on that.</P>

      <P>Following an orientation debate, under the heading Preparations for the European Council in Barcelona, it was agreed that the Spanish Presidency would draft a key issues paper. This paper will take into account the contributions of other Council formations and be submitted for approval to the next ECOFIN meeting on 5 March and for onward submission to Barcelona.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the stability and growth pact, the Council examined the 2001 updated stability programmes for France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the convergence programme of the UK, and approved Council opinions on those programmes. The Council also considered updated stability programmes from Germany and Portugal, and Commission recommendations for early warnings to prevent excessive deficits to issue to both of these member states. It adopted two statements welcoming the commitments of the German and Portuguese governments to respond to the concerns expressed in the Commission's recommendations and agreed Council opinions on both programmes, thereby closing the procedure. The Council's opinion on Ireland's stability programme was agreed. The Council's <Col N="1253" /> general conclusion is that the budgetary projections for 2002 set out in our stability programme do not present problems.</P>
    <P>With regard to the euro, Ministers also took note of an oral presentation by the Commission on the latest information concerning the successful changeover. The Council welcomed the progress achieved and looked forward to a further oral report at its meeting on 5 March.</P>
    <P>The Council further welcomed the fact that all member states had completed the ratification procedure for the Council decision of 29 September 2000 on the system of the European Communities' own resources and that this decision will now enter into force on 1 March.</P>
    <P>The Council then held an exchange of views on the financial aspects of the Commission's communication on a common financial framework for the accession negotiations with candidate countries. It noted that the debate had provided useful guidance for the Commission as an input for its work in preparing draft common positions for the financial aspects of enlargement with candidate countries.</P>
    <P>Over lunch the Council was briefed on the outcome of the Euro-group meeting of the previous evening and the progress on negotiations with third countries and dependant territories on the taxation of savings.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Regulation on Cross-Border Transfers (No. 2560/2001), agreed by the Council of Ministers and by the European Parliament last December, has established the principle that charges levied by an institution in respect of cross-border consumer payments in euro will be the same as the charges levied by the same institution for corresponding domestic payments. Although this regulation does not apply to cheques, it will ensure that costs of other convenient methods of cross-border payments are reduced. To be specific, the regulation provides that with effect from 1 July charges for electronic payments in euro, such as cash withdrawals using an ATM card, shall be the same at both the domestic and cross-border level; and with effect from <Col N="1254" /> 1 July 2003 there shall be a similar equalisation of charges at domestic and cross-border level in the case of other transfers such as credit transfers.</P>

    <P>VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer, especially given this Government's strategy of reducing income tax and corporation tax. Receipts from VRT in 2001 were in the region of &euro;790 million, while receipts in 2000 were in the region of &euro;1,000 million. To recover this amount of money in alternative taxes would require, for example, a 36 cent per litre excise duty increase in the price of petrol or an increase in the standard rate of income tax of over two percentage points.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not the only member state which has a tax on vehicle registration. Eight other countries have a registration tax, including Denmark, Finland, Greece and Portugal, some at higher levels than apply in Ireland. These taxes are operated in a variety of ways and, as such, are not directly comparable with VRT as applied in Ireland. Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and the UK do not charge registration tax and France and Italy charge the tax at a nominal rate. Many other countries also tax fuel at a higher rate, including the UK. All these factors must be borne in mind in making cross country comparisons.</P>

At that time I reiterated that the original intention of the initiative was to foster and develop, within departments, a critical perspective on their activities and programmes and to increase the quality of public debate on public spending.

In addition, departmental evaluation units conducted individual studies in this period of various programmes in the previous National Plan 1994-1999. Value for money studies undertaken by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General also made a valuable contribution to the analysis and review of various programmes, projects and expenditure areas.</P>
      <P>In the light of experience with the expenditure review initiative in the period 1997 to 2000, inclusive, the Comptroller and Auditor General concludes that the initial target of reviewing 100% of all Government spending over three years was probably not feasible. The report goes on to propose that a more realistic target be set and suggests a shift towards a more focused approach to the selection of projects.</P>
      <P>Learning from the experience so far, I am now asking Departments-offices to focus on significant areas of spending in the 2002-2004 programme. The Government agreed specific criteria to assist them in the selection of suitable topics for review in June 2001. My Department has also put in place a number of other initiatives, such as a new training programme for reviewers and a network for disseminating best practice. At present Departments are formulating their three year expenditure review plans and selecting topics for 2002. They are also being encouraged to publish final review reports conducted under their aegis.</P>

      <P>The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established in July 2000 and was asked to report by 30 June 2002. It was agreed by the parties that there would be four phases: phase 1 &ndash; written submission by the parties; phase 2 &ndash; research by the body itself; phase 3 &ndash; oral hearings and any further written submissions based on the research; and phase 4 &ndash; finalisation of the report by the body. Written submissions were made by the parties to the body. It has carried out its research of the public service grades being examined and in the private sector. Oral hearings for each group, where both sides had the opportunity to put arguments in support of their case, were completed in December 2001.</P>
      <P>The body is now in the final stage. It is deliberating on the issues and drafting its report with a view to finalising it by the end of June 2002. There will be one report at the end of the process. This was agreed by both the unions and the employers and is contained in the body's terms of reference.</P>

      <P>The statement made by the Director of Consumer Affairs to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 21 November last was wide-ranging and touched upon many issues. Among the issues addressed were the matter of restrictions in cheque encashment procedures. The director observed that many institutions seemed to have amended their cheque encashment procedures at the same time. She expressed the belief that these amendments may have arisen from a decision of the Irish Payment Services Organisation which controls entry to the cheque settlement system. She said she had advised the Competition Authority of her concerns in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the specific issue of the changes in cheque encashment policy which occurred towards the end of 2000 and early 2001, my Department has no statutory function in this area. As a result of representations from my Department with the Bank of Ireland and AIB, several proposed changes in cheque encashment prac<Col N="1257" /> tices which would have seriously inconvenienced customers, were postponed or withdrawn, including that the new system would not apply to certain pension payments. In addition, my Department was in correspondence with the ODCA, in which we sought to address the concerns expressed by the director on this issue.</P>
    <P>As regards the general issue of control of the retail payments system, it should be noted that the Competition Authority is the most appropriate body to pursue any such inquiry into alleged uncompetitive practices. Although it expressed concerns about the level of competition in the Irish banking industry, no abuses of competition law have been sustained against the banking sector.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in 1998 they obtained details of 430 cases with investments made under the National Irish Bank-CMI schemes. To date, 306 of these cases have been settled and 124 are still under investigation, 11 of them for possible prosecution through the courts.</P>
      <P>To date, Revenue has collected &euro;33.75 million, or £26.58 million, in tax, interest and penalties in respect of these cases.

    <P>Following a further review of their records by <Col N="1258" /> the financial institution concerned, a supplementary list containing 22 new cases was received by Revenue in April 2001.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred to the situation on approved share options schemes on a number of occasions recently in this House.</P>
      <P>Last year I introduced an amended tax treatment of share options that provided for favourable tax treatment whereby, on disposal, the gain from shares acquired as a result of employee share options would be chargeable to capital gains tax only, providing certain conditions were satisfied. The main conditions were that the scheme should apply to all employees on similar terms.</P>
      <P>This was done following extensive consultation with representative bodies and the relevant State agencies. It was considered that the scheme, as introduced, would meet its objective namely, to help companies recruit and reward highly skilled and internationally mobile staff as well as facilitating participation by all employees in the fortunes of the company they work for.</P>
      <P>I listened to the calls for share options to be used as an incentive and introduced a key employee provision where options can be granted without similar terms conditions. In such a case no more than 30% of the total number of shares over which rights are granted in any year can be used for the key employee element.</P>
      <P>The capital gains tax treatment of what was heretofore considered chargeable to income tax is a generous relief and is without limits. Therefore, it is reasonable that it should only apply in defined circumstances.</P>
      <P>To date the total number of applications received and reviewed by the Revenue Commissioners is 71. Nine schemes have been approved and approximately 6,800 employees can benefit from these. There are two main elements that are creating difficulties for some schemes that are seeking approval from Revenue, namely the all employee and similar terms rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have been made to me to soften the similar terms rules to provide greater discretion to companies in allocation of options and also to allow companies where not all employees are eligible to come within the scheme. There has been considerable discussion <Col N="1259" /> with my Department's officials on these proposals.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed are complex and give rise to significant issues of policy and numerous practical difficulties in terms of application of any proposed amended rules. Having reflected on the matter I have decided against making any fundamental change to the scheme at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 186 and 206 together.</P>
      <P>Overall I am very satisfied with the implementation of the NDP. Good progress has been made in key areas of the plan investment, notably infrastructure, education and training and the promotion of social inclusion.</P>
      <P>The Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme has performed especially well and the Employment and Human Resources Operational Programme is broadly on target.</P>
      <P>In the regional OPs good progress has been made on most measures, especially the local roads, rural water, local enterprise, community development and child care measures. Progress on some measures was impeded by difficulties arising out of State aid approval and the foot and mouth disease restrictions. This applied especially to the agriculture and tourism measures. These were resolved during 2001.</P>
      <P>The Productive Sector Operational Programme has seen lower levels of expenditure than expected. The demand-led measures have suffered from a lack of private sector investment due to the global economic downturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised by IBEC and the CIF have been mainly concerned with the infrastructure element of the NDP. In this respect there has been an excellent roll-out of the NDP infrastructure programme over the first two years of the plan. The evidence of this is visible throughout the country as infrastructure projects, especially <Col N="1260" /> in the transport and environment areas, of a scale never seen before in Ireland, are either under construction or at various stages of planning. Reflecting this outstanding performance, it is estimated that during the three years, 2000 to 2002, over &euro;10.1 billion will have been invested in economic and social infrastructure under the plan. This is in excess of the commitment in the published operational programmes. More significantly, by the end of 2002 the Exchequer will have provided over &euro;750 million more than originally promised.</P>
    <P>IBEC and the CIF have recently focused particular attention on the NDP roads programme. Over the first three years of the plan the Exchequer has provided gross funding of some &euro;2.5 billion for the this programme, which is &euro;260 million above that committed in the published OP. Almost &euro;1 billion is being provided by the Exchequer in 2002. Overall there is good roll-out of the programme in the first two years of the plan.</P>
    <P>While resources to fund the NDP over the remainder of the plan will, as with all public spending, be subject to the ongoing budgetary situation, the Government remains committed to the implementation of the NDP, particularly the key infrastructure programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The gender equality policy commits the Civil Service to equality of opportunity for men and women.</P>
      <P>Under the policy Departments must set strategic objectives and equality goals for increasing women's representation at all levels, but in particular at the higher management grades where women are under represented. These objectives and goals are set out in departmental strategy statements.</P>
      <P>To focus the policy the Government has set a target for the key assistant principal grade to ensure that there will be more women who can be promoted to senior levels. Departments must work to ensure that by 2005 as much as 33% of assistant principal posts are filled by women. At present women fill only 27% of these posts. The policy also requires Departments to set goals to deal with obstacles to career progression for women at all levels and to take initiatives in all the main human resource areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equality unit in my Department is supporting other Departments with the implementation of the policy. Heads of Departments and offices <Col N="1261" /> have nominated officers with responsibility for gender equality. The equality unit will meet these nominated officers over the next few weeks with a view to assisting them in implementing the policy. The aim is to exchange ideas and to help each other in achieving our objectives in the gender equality area. The unit will prepare a short report for the information of Departments, outlining what has been done and suggesting what further steps might be taken.</P>
    <P>Regarding my Department, targets have been set which, over the next five years and subject to the number of vacancies arising, should see the representation of women increasing from 28% to close to 35% in the AP grade and from 14% to close to 25% at the principal grade. A policy is being prepared for the Department which will address a wide range of equality issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the investigation of offshore funds and deposits, which may not have been disclosed for tax purposes, including Ansbacher accounts, is an integral part of Revenue's operations.</P>
      <P>A relatively small number of cases involving offshore funds or deposits would have made voluntary declarations to Revenue over the years. The liabilities in such cases would normally involve items in addition to the offshore funds, for example, capital gains, undeclared rents and suppressed drawings of funds from a business. The ingredients of settlements vary from case to case and statistics on the ingredients of settlements are not retained. In addition, payments made in confidence under the terms of the 1993 amnesty may have covered funds in offshore accounts. In the circumstances it is not possible to provide the overall figures requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By far the predominant number of cases under inquiry and investigation derive from the extensive use by Revenue of legislative powers, that is other than by way of voluntary declaration. In <Col N="1264" /> this connection Revenue has made successful applications to the High Court for the production by financial institutions of books, records and other documentation which are relevant to liabilities of Ansbacher account holders. This work on the investigation of the Ansbacher account holders is complex and time consuming and is likely to continue for some time to come. At present it is not possible to indicate the total amount of tax, interest and penalties that may be involved in the investigation.</P>
    <P>The Ansbacher investigation has essentially two elements. There are cases involving Ansbacher type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</P>
    <P>Revenue has indicated that it is inquiring into 197 Ansbacher type cases. These consist of 121 cases named by the authorised officer and 76 similar cases discovered by Revenue. A total of 168 cases are under active investigation. Inquiries have not yet commenced in the remaining 29 because of insufficient identity information, apparent non-residency or the 1993 amnesty being claimed. A large number of connected entities and trusts is also being investigated.</P>
    <P>To date a total of &euro;16.67 million or £13.13 million has been received, mostly by way of payments on account, in respect of 49 cases. This is made up of:</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department recently published its strategy statement for the period to 31 December 2003. It sets out my Department's strategic priorities and high level objectives, how these will be met and how available resources will be used. The statement identifies objectives to be met in relation to each strategic priority, emphasising expected outcomes. It also includes a section on measuring progress against objectives and performance. The objectives for my Department are operationalised through the business plans developed at division/section level, and individual people's objectives, agreed as part of the performance management and development system.</P>
      <P>In order to measure performance against objectives my Department employs a range of internal measurement mechanisms, the most significant of which is the publication of the annual progress report. My Department has published a full set of reports on progress in relation to the priorities and objectives of the previous strategy statement. The first progress report on the latest strategy statement is currently being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date I have been satisfied with my Department's contribution to achieving this Government's objectives through the implementation of its strategy. The modernisation programme in the Department supports the achievement of the Department's goals, as set out in the strategy statement. The objectives of the programme, based on the key modernisation objectives outlined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, are as follows: to position the Department to meet the ongoing changes in the external environment; to provide an excellent service to <Col N="1265" /> customers; to maintain a strategic focus on the Department's role and functions to ensure the provision of leadership and co-ordination across key areas of Government policy; and to work in partnership with the staff of the Department to bring about changes required.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of the PPF, my Department submitted performance indicators for its modernisation programme, which were developed through the internal partnership process, to the independent Civil Service quality assurance group. Specific actions and target dates across all aspects of modernisation are covered by my Department's performance indicators. Progress has been made in relation to each of the key indicators. Expected outcomes include improved strategic management; organisational and individual performance and capability, and quality customer service.</P>
    <P>My Department will submit a report to the CSQAG after 1 April, detailing progress in achieving its performance indicators. This group will then make an independent assessment of each Department's progress in meeting the PPF objectives in relation to the modernisation agenda, including progress made by my Department.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many businesses are facing and of the problems this is creating for them.</P>
      <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for insurance companies. EU law prevents me and the Department from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the affects of 11 September attacks in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, who had a significant presence in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental implementation group is progressing the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board. I am confident that its establishment will achieve a reduction in the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, thus permitting a reduction in insurance costs to consumers.</P>
      <P>A workplace safety group has been established with a view to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. At present the group is developing proposals designed to bring the initiative to small and medium sized firms.</P>
      <P>I encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of reducing the worst effects of the current circumstances, for example by better management of risks, examination of excess covers and whether the full extent of the cover included in policies is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed. This also reflects a shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The allocation of places and the renewal of projects is an operational mat<Col N="1268" /> ter for FÁS. Projects are prioritised and based on the services being provided, for example drugs task force projects, personal assistant services for persons with disabilities and the level of unemployment in the locality. At present there is in the region of 30,000 participants on CE.</P>
      <P>The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including the health and environmental sectors, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. Mainstreaming involves the transfer of CE funds for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for those services. Once mainstreaming has commenced participants are not being replaced when their term on the programme has finished. Such projects will be wound down gradually.</P>
      <P>Last year I introduced greater flexibility in the operation of CE in recognition of the particular barriers to employment which exist for certain participants, in particular for older workers and those in remote rural areas with limited employment opportunities locally. FÁS now has discretion to extend an individual's term on CE on a case by case basis, within limits, having regard to that person's needs and future employment prospects.</P>
      <P>My Department will, in the context of the current overall restructuring of the programme, continue to keep the future operation of CE under review. It will pay particular reference to its primary role as an active labour market programme to assist participants to progress into jobs and-or further education and training. In this regard, as provided for under the PPF, an overall review of active labour market programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the near future under the aegis of the PPF standing committee on the labour market. The future policy direction of CE will be informed by the outcome of this process.</P>

      <P>The provision of support to industrial projects is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, would have a direct function. The relevant agencies are Shannon Development, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the financing of capital infrastructure projects. In that context the agencies' policy in recent years has been to move away from capacity building supports, such as capital grants, and towards supports targeted at improving specific business functions such as research and development and skills enhancement.</P>
      <P>During 2001 Shannon Development's capital spend in County Kerry came to a total of &euro;5.2 million in investment in Kerry Technology Park in Tralee. On completion of the project this will amount to &euro;7.4 million. Enterprise Ireland gave approved funding of &euro;126,973.81 towards Killarney Technology Innovation Centre in Deerpark, Killarney which was completed in 2001. Enterprise Ireland also approved funding of &euro;34,282.93 for a community enterprise centre in Cahirciveen which was completed in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" />IDA Ireland's policy has been to make land available for capital projects where necessary rather than to provide capital financial supports. Recent IDA developments include the sale of a 1.3 acre site to Killarney Plastics Limited in 2000, the site was completed in 2001; the sale of a one acre site to Killarney Advance Factory Limited; agreement on a &euro;1.2 million site development and landscaping contract for completion of the development of Killarney Business Park; and, in Cahirciveen, the sale of a 20,000 square foot unit to FEXCO Limited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the application to the European Commission for re-adaptation aid funding under Article 56(2)(<i>b</i>) of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty, in respect of steel workers who were made redundant as a result of the 1994 Irish Steel restructuring plan, an application was made by my Department on the basis that the extra-statutory redundancy payments received by these workers constituted the State's matching funds. The extra-statutory redundancy payments which had been paid to the workers by Irish Steel were taken into consideration in a State aid package made to the company in 1996. This effectively resulted in a contribution being made directly from Exchequer funds towards the extra-statutory redundancy payments. The European Commission accepted that the extra-statutory redundancy payments could be regarded as matching funding for the purposes of the application. This position was in line with the 1991 convention between the European Commission and the Government which defines the terms and conditions for the granting of re-adaptation aid. A legal opinion, produced by the Attorney General in September 1999, supported the State's interpretation of the 1991 convention in relation to the matching funding. Therefore, there are no matching payments outstanding to the former employees.</P>
      <P>The workers, who lost their jobs as a result of the closure of Irish Ispat last year, only received statutory redundancy payments. They did not receive extra-statutory redundancy payments. As it is a condition of the European Commission that the State makes a matching payment before any ECSC re-adaptation aid can be paid, it was necessary to pay &euro;3,000 to each of the workers. Last December this was approved by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the workers, who lost their <Col N="1271" /> jobs as a result of the 1994 re-structuring plan, received extra-statutory redundancy payments. The European Commission regarded these payments as matching funding for the ECSC aid which they received. The workers made redundant last year did not receive extra-statutory redundancy payments but instead were paid a direct contribution from the State in order that they would be eligible for ECSC aid.</P>

      <P>The terrible events of 11 September were a major shock to the entire international economic order.</P>
      <P>These events had a particular impact on Ireland because of our strong tourism, trading and investment links with the United States. With particular regard to aviation, the Government established an <i>ad hoc</i> group to consider ways of countering reductions in air services in the aftermath of 11 September and of stimulating new route development from our three major airports. My Department is one of a number of Departments represented on this group and its work is ongoing.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development is the agency, under the aegis of my Department, responsible for industrial and tourism development in the Shannon region. Late Iast year the company, in conjunction with IBEC, conducted a survey of business opinion in the region. The survey focused on the impact of the reduction in air services to Shannon airport. Some 110 companies were included in the survey. Of these only two indicated that they may consider relocating all or part of their operations in the Shannon region to continental Europe.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly committed to regional development. The long-term prospects for the Shannon region are excellent. The region is set to benefit from a massive programme of investment in essential infrastructure over the next five years and is very well placed to gain from the recovery in the international economy.</P>

      <P>When the ban on the use of drift nets in the Albacore tuna fishery was agreed at the June 1998 Fisheries Council, Ireland pressed successfully for research funding from the Commission to assist the development of alternative fishing techniques and technology transfer. The objective was to assist Irish fishermen to convert to other means of fishing for the species.</P>
      <P>The resulting diversification trials, which BIM have organised since 1998, have produced positive results. These trials were widely advertised and participation in them was open to all interested fishermen. Accordingly, the question of discriminatory treatment does not arise.</P>
      <P>In addition to securing a significant quota of 3,158 tonnes for this species in both 2001 and this year, we have also won agreement at EU level to allow Ireland to double the number of vessels in the tuna fishery. Up to 50 Irish vessels can participate in the tuna fishery this year. All the indications are that demand will exceed this maximum number of available licences. My Department will be consulting with the industry shortly in relation to the finalisation of arrangements for participation in this year's fishery.</P>

      <P>As part of the package negotiated in 1998 to postpone the introduction of the ban on drift-netting for albacore tuna until 2002, the Council of the European Union agreed to a provision that the number of authorised drift-net participants from 1998 onwards would not exceed 60% of those with a track record in the fishery in the period 1995 to 1997.

      <P>I understand from the Chief State Solicitors office and the office of the Attorney General that the High Court order in this case can only be released to persons who are party to the proceedings.

      <P>The total area of the foreshore covered by the covenant is approximately 272,441 square metres.

      <P>It is not possible to readily provide a breakdown of all capital expenditure by project for County Kerry in 2001 as this information is not held by my Department in that format. My Department is at present rolling out the installation of an NDP computerised reporting system, in accordance with the Government's decision of July 2001, which will provide comprehensive details of expenditure on a county basis under the NDP.</P>
      <P>The following tables (1-6) set out provisional expenditure outturns in 2001 for capital programmes in respect of which it has been possible to isolate projects in County Kerry:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The national whiting quota in the Celtic Sea for 2002 is 8,814 tonnes. This represents a 51% increase over 2001 and will deliver enhanced fishing possibilities for Irish fishermen this year.</P>
      <P>A specific management regime for the fishery was introduced in January in order to minimise the potential for market over-supply of whiting in the spring months when the fishery is most active and which has led in the past to depressed prices. The management regime for February increases catch limits over the January regime while continuing to reflect the need to ensure balance between supply and demand and also to avoid early closure of fisheries through premature exhaustion of quota.</P>
      <P>I will keep the fishery and market conditions under close review, in consultation with the industry. Future management regimes will continue to take all relevant factors into account.</P>

      <Quest>further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 96 to 99, inclusive, and No. 109 of 12 February 2002 and the statement on marine tourism in the national development plan, if he will confirm that he will provide sanction of ?25.4 million for marine tourism; if this will cover inland rivers and canals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5808/02]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my previous replies to the Deputy, &euro;25.4 million has been allocated to the marine tourism sub-measure which will be implemented by my Department as part of the two regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This allocation will be provided entirely from Exchequer funds and will therefore be subject to the normal <Col N="1282" /> sanctioning procedures which apply to the provision of such funds in the Vote for my Department.</P>
      <P>In developing its priorities for the national development plan, my Department, in consultation with the Marine Institute, has identified the lack of an adequate coastal infrastructure provision as a key development constraint to water-based tourism and leisure, and the most serious obstacle to development as being the lack of service infrastructure in coastal regions in terms of serviceable harbours, piers, slipways and moorings.</P>
      <P>As a result, the improvement of access infrastructure in coastal and estuarine areas has been targeted by my Department as the primary focus for development under the scheme. In pursuing this policy, it is intended that investment in infrastructure will concentrate on providing facilities in coastal areas which have suffered from under-investment in the past and which have the potential to provide either new, or enhanced, recreational infrastructure to facilitate activities like general boating, angling and water sports. </P>

      <P>Ireland Aid, the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries, is in the exit phase of its involvement in Zimbabwe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For reasons related both to Zimbabwe's current state of governance and to its status in development terms hitherto &ndash; it is not in the least developed category &ndash; there has been no government to government programme of assistance for Zimbabwe. However, some limited assistance has been provided either through non-Governmental agencies or through multilateral organisations for interventions designed to <Col N="1283" /> address the basic needs of the poorest of the poor.</P>
    <P>In this regard, our remaining involvement is the final phase of a programme to provide water and sanitation in poor rural areas of western Zimbabwe. The programme, valued this year at &euro;952,303, is implemented by UNICEF. Funding for the programme will cease by end 2003.</P>
    <P>We share the view of the Danish Government that programmes of assistance cannot be sustained in countries which fall below required thresholds in terms of the quality of governance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland Aid makes a large number of payments to NGOS and international organisations for development purposes. These payments are for projects right across the development spectrum including,<i> inter alia</i>, health, education, agriculture, water, sanitation, and construction. These projects are primarily multi-sectoral and poverty focused. As the environment is a cross-cutting issue, many of these projects have an environmental aspect.</P>
      <P>A full list of all such projects over the years, including payments and specific locations, is outlined in the Ireland Aid annual reports, which are available in the Oireachtas Library. These reports, the latest of which is for 2000, also give a comprehensive outline of the overall sectoral and geographic focus of the aid programme. The annual report for 2001 will be published later this year.</P>
      <P>For convenience, I am forwarding separately to the Deputy the last three published reports.</P>
      <P>Apart from these, there have been no other payments from the Department of Foreign Affairs to environmental NGOs since 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann is currently undertaking a major investment programme to upgrade the Kildare line to provide additional capacity. This is being designed to meet the predicted demand levels for rail services on the corridor in question and is one of the projects benefiting under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The project is also included in the DTO strategy, A Platform for Change.</P>
      <P>The project involves developing Heuston Station as well as track and signalling work along the line to Kildare and is being funded from Exchequer and EU sources.</P>
      <P>The work at Heuston Station will cost an estimated &euro;117 million and more than &euro;65 million is being provided this year. I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that this work will over the next 18 months lead to increases in Kildare route commuter capacity and for a number of Intercity services. The first phase of this work will: increase the number of platforms in Heuston Station from five to nine, with platforms lengthened for increased number of services; remodel the trackwork at Heuston and the approaches to the station to allow for more flexible operations, and reduce delays; resignal the Heuston and Inchicore cabin areas to modern computerised signalling; and see a secondary concourse provided to improve customer comfort and facilities at Heuston.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann will also start taking delivery this year of 80 new diesel railcars.</P>
      <P>When the work at Heuston Station is finished next year and when the rolling stock goes into service, there will be significant additional capacity for commuters. There will also be major safety benefits associated with the project.</P>
      <P>In addition work is being planned to increase the capacity of the track and signalling system and my department is expecting to receive shortly a submission from Iarnród Éireann in that respect. The project is expected to be completed in 2005.</P>

      <P>Significant work on the Maynooth suburban rail line was completed last year. Invest<Col N="1285" /> ment on the doubling of the track on the line and the provision of 20 additional diesel railcars amounted to approximately &euro;55 million.</P>
      <P>The next project to impact on the capacity of the route is the upgrading of Connolly Station. This project, currently at the design and planning stage, sets out to increase the capacity of the line between Connolly and Pearse Stations, thereby allowing extra trains through the city centre.</P>
      <P>Exchequer funding of &euro;7 million was provided for planning and design work on the project in 2001. Further Exchequer funds will be allocated in 2002 following receipt in the coming weeks by my Department of detailed cost estimates from Iarnród Éireann for planned works in the year ahead.</P>
      <P>In addition, Iarnród Éireann will start taking delivery of 80 diesel rail cars during the year and it is their intention to deploy some of these carriages to increase the capacity on the Maynooth line.</P>

      <P>In relation to public transport, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the expenditure on a county by county basis. Apart from meeting general transport objectives, a well functioning nation-wide public transport infrastructure is vital for making optimal use of road infrastructure, minimising the impact on the environment of transport, promoting balanced regional development and making transport as widely accessible as possible. Most of the projects being undertaken, therefore, will provide benefits across county borders.</P>
      <P>In relation to County Kerry, however, certain capital projects can be singled out which were completed in 2001. These include the refurbishment of the Tralee bus station costing &euro;209,444 and work done on the Tralee-Mallow railway line at a cost of &euro;5.92 million. This latter work involved renewal work such as track relaying, bridges level crossings and associated priority work.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, I signed a contract with Chorus in 2000 entitled Kerry Broadband Communications Corridor to upgrade the microwave backbone between Limerick and Cork and to provide broadband services in the area. This project embraces the counties of Limerick, Clare, Cork, and Kerry. As this project is still at constructional stage, expenditure levels are unavailable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of promotional agencies in both the industrial and tourism sectors have been in touch with me and my Department concerning the impact of the downturn in the aviation sector, following the events of 11 September last, on flight services to and from our State airports including the reduction in Aer Lingus services on the Dublin-Shannon route.</P>
      <P>Under European air transport liberalisation measures, any air carrier licensed by a European Economic Area, i.e. the 15 member states of the European Union plus Norway and Iceland, may introduce air services on any route within the EEA without any government or EU controls, subject only to the availability of airport slots at either end of the route and, of course, overall safety considerations. As a result the provision of air services on any particular route is essentially a matter for the commercial judgment of the individual airline.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Aer Lingus announced a range of cutbacks as part of its survival plan, which is aimed at addressing the very difficult situation facing the company as a result of the dramatic downturn in the global aviation market. Other carriers have also been obliged to implement capacity cuts.</P>
      <P>The Shannon-Dublin route is still being serviced by Aer Lingus on a commercial basis albeit on a reduced frequency.</P>
      <P>Aer Arann Express announced yesterday that it will commence services on the Shannon-Dublin route on 11 March with one daily flight and increasing to two rotations on 1 April. I understand that the Aer Arann schedule will provide an early morning departure from Shannon to Dublin which the company points out will facilitate passengers who either want to make the round trip within the day or who wish to make connections at Dublin for onward international flights. I very much welcome this initiative by Aer Arann which will go a long way towards restoring services on the Shannon-Dublin route to their former levels especially for business travellers in the Shannon region and for tourism interests in the west.</P>
      <P>In addition to the new Aer Arann service, a range of new air services to and from Ireland have already commenced or are scheduled to start up this year. These include a new Ryanair service from Shannon to Paris which commenced last week, a Skynet service from Shannon to Dublin and Warsaw which is scheduled to start in the coming weeks, and an Air Canada service from Toronto to Shannon and Dublin to start in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would expect that when the aviation market recovers generally, airlines will review oppor<Col N="1288" /> tunities for re-establishing services which have been lost or reduced in the aftermath of the events of 11 September last.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, despite the current difficulties in the aviation sector, the future viability of Shannon Airport is secure and that it will continue to grow and prosper, continuing its valuable contribution to balanced regional development. The Government is committed to maintaining a viable Shannon Airport as well as a viable Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces modernisation programme required the closure of a number of military barracks beginning with a number in 1998 and concluding with Clancy Barracks late last year. These closures inconvenienced a number of Defence Forces personnel, some of whom may also have incurred additional financial costs by virtue of their new posting. I am sympathetically disposed to such personnel. Discussions on this matter have taken place with both of the Defence Forces representative associations under the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme. Agreement was reached some time ago with the Commissioned Officers Association, RACO, but negotiations are continuing with PDFORRA. By agreement with the associations, discussions under the scheme are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this issue, other than to say I am hopeful of an early resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous questions from the Deputy concerning this case, the person in question was injured in a road traffic accident in June 1955 while on duty as a member of the FCA. He instituted civil proceedings against the owner of the car involved in the accident and received compensation of £2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also applied for compensation under the terms of the Emergency Powers (Compensation for Personnel Injuries) (Local Defence Force) Scheme, 1942, and was found eligible for an award of periodic compensation under the scheme. However, no payments were actually made to him because the relevant amount of periodic compensation was less than the actuarial value of the compensation which he had received. His case was kept under review and he was re-<Col N="1291" /> examined on a number of occasions by the Army Pensions Board. When he was called for a further medical examination in 1962, the correspondence addressed to him was returned to the Department with the endorsement &ldquo;gone away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Nothing was heard from the individual until some 30 years later when he made contact with the Department's Renmore office and a letter was issued to him in May 1991 clarifying the points raised. There was no further contact with him until early 2001 when he sought access to the Departmental files relating to his case. He was provided with copies of those papers and, in May 2001, the Deputy put down a parliamentary question concerning the case. In the course of my reply to that Question No. 134 of 29 May, I outlined the background to the case and undertook to have it reviewed.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the person was examined by the Army Pensions Board and the board reported to the Department. Following consideration of the case in the Department, an award of periodic compensation was made to the individual in question. In recognition of the unusual circumstances of the case, it was decided as a concession to backdate the award for a period of six years. In that context, it was also decided, exceptionally, that the actuarial value of the civil compensation received by the person should not be deducted from the periodic compensation and not to pursue the question of the recovery of the cost of the maintenance and treatment of the person in a military hospital as a result of the accident. A substantial lump sum payment covering the retrospective period was issued to the person on 31 October 2001 and his continuing entitlement to periodic compensation is paid on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, having regard to all aspects of this case, that the person has been treated fairly and reasonably by my Department. Accordingly, the question of establishing an internal inquiry does not arise.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid &euro;1,019.38 (£802.83) under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme on 24 September 2001 in respect of 17.84 hectares of mountain-type land at &euro;57.14 (£45) per hectare. This compares with his average headage payment of &euro;678.71 (£534.53) under the old animal-based headage schemes in the three years 1998 to 2000 inclusive.</P>
      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system, regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a thorough review of the area-based compensatory allowance scheme, proposals have been submitted to the European Commission for increased payment rates for farmers with mountain-type land. The proposals involve making a <Col N="1293" /> payment of £80 per hectare on the first ten hectares of mountain-type land with a payment of £70 per hectare on each remaining hectare subject to an overall payment ceiling of 45 hectares. Subject to securing the necessary EU approval it is intended that the revised payment rates will apply to the 2001 scheme.</P>

      <P>The animal-based headage schemes were replaced in 2001 by the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The new scheme, which was approved by the European Commission, provides that applicants must meet a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the holding in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and/or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of under grazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000, and according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department wrote to the person named on 7 November 2001 with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A reply was received in the district livestock office with details of the stock on the holding. As the stocking density was 0.11 livestock units per hectare in 2001 he would not appear to qualify for payment under the 2001 area-based compensatory allow<Col N="1295" /> ance scheme. A final decision on all outstanding cases will be made soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a requirement of the EU Council regulations governing both schemes of early retirement that the early retirement pension may only be granted as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, or their spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, may receive. This means that the amount of any national retirement pension payable must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>
      <P>Within that context I was pleased to secure the agreement of the European Commission recently that widow's and widower's pensions (contributory and non-contributory), payable to participants who are under 66 years of age, should not be deducted from pensions paid under the new early retirement scheme. This was already the position under the previous scheme. The effect of this change is retrospective to the commencement of the scheme in November 2000 and arrangements are being made to refund deductions to participants who had already joined.</P>

      <P>The 30-day holding period for purchases of susceptible animals, which was introduced initially in the context of the foot and mouth emergency, is intended to slow down animal movement in order to limit the risk of spread of disease. The measure applies to all parties engaged in the movement of animals and not simply to livestock dealers and agents. It has been reviewed on several occasions most recently in late January 2002. In announcing my decision to retain it until 28 February 2002, I also indicated that it will be reviewed again before the end of this month.</P>
      <P>In so far as dealing operations are concerned, a number of exemptions to the 30-day rule are available to assist registered dealers and agents in the conduct of their business. These exemptions were extended at the beginning of this month and, subject to certain conditions, allow dealers and agents to purchase cattle from marts and sell them privately within the 30 days and to purchase cattle privately and sell them onwards at a mart or privately within the 30-day period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other exemptions apply in respect of: animals <Col N="1297" /> moved to slaughter plants, including slaughter plants in Northern Ireland; cattle moved for export from approved export assembly centres, some 14 premises in all; and cattle moved through some 19 premises used by live exporters to marshal cattle and test them prior to export.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the 30-day rule as applied at present is a sensible precautionary measure in the context of limiting the spread of disease and that the exemptions in place are sufficient to facilitate dealers, agents and exporters in their ongoing business.</P>
    <P>A 30-day retention requirement also applies in Northern Ireland with minimum exemptions.</P>

      <P>In the course of the foot and mouth crisis, a number of animal movement and other restrictions were introduced to prevent the introduction of and/or spread of disease. Many of these measures have at this stage been discontinued, having regard to the facts that there has not been a case of FMD in Britain since 30 September 2001, the lifting by the EU of all FMD-related restrictions on trade in animals and animal products from the UK and the recent re-instatement by the OIE, the world animal health body, of the UK to FMD-free status. However, it is critical for the protection of the animal health status of this country, that all of those involved in the agri-food industry should learn lessons from the FMD episode.</P>
      <P>In this regard a number of the measures introduced during the FMD crisis have a more general application in the prevention of other animal diseases likely to have a serious impact on the agricultural and other sectors of the economy. The FMD crisis was the second major animal health crisis to strike in the UK within a very short period of time, there had been a serious outbreak of classical swine fever in the south-east of England in 2000.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, a number of controls designed to prevent the introduction of or spread of disease, and to facilitate the tracing of disease in the event of an outbreak, remain in place. These include: the application of full intra community trade and certification rules to trade with Northern Ireland in animals of susceptible species; the retention of restrictions on the frequency of internal livestock movements, e.g. the 30 day rule &ndash; these will be kept under review; disinfection and enhanced controls at points of access to the State, i.e. ports and airports, by persons travelling from outside the island of Ireland; and the retention of a range of other measures such as sheep tagging, registration of dealers, regulation of trade in sheep and pigs with Northern Ireland and controls on sheep shearing and AI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as trade in sheep with Northern <Col N="1299" /> Ireland is concerned, the current restrictions, including those requiring sheep imported for slaughter from Northern Ireland to be slaughtered at export plants, will remain for the present, in order to facilitate tight control of this trade in the aftermath of FMD. I will, however, as with all other controls, keep this matter under continuing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>A panel of 64 valuers has been established under the on-farm market valuation scheme to carry out the live valuation of animals. The undertaking of valuations is the valuers' sole function and they are not involved in arbitrating in disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the arrangements for the scheme provide for measures to resolve disputes including an appeal valuation and referral to an arbitration panel in cases where the appeal valuation is not accepted by either the farmer or the Department. The composition of the arbitration panel has recently been agreed and it will consist <Col N="1300" /> of an independent chairperson who is a member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, together with a representative nominated by the farm bodies and from my Department. The panel will be meeting shortly to determine the action to be taken in relation to the small number of cases awaiting consideration.  </P>

      <P>The following schedule indicates the total allocations made to Leader groups for the periods, 1995-99 and 2000-06.</P>
      <P>One of the elements of the Leader programme is support for environmental projects at local level. Leader 11, introduced in May 1995, had an allocation of IR£93 million of EU and national funding. Expenditure on environmentally related projects was £10.6 million.</P>
      <P>Leader in the period 2000-06 includes a measure to support environmentally friendly initiatives, which is expected to be between 5% and 10% of the total allocation for the programme, which is almost &euro;150 million.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a 2000 extensification grant, lower rate, payment was not made to persons (details supplied) in County Galway; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this herd was closed down due to tuberculosis outbreaks for most of 2000; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that this person has no other income; if he will allow the payment of the extensification; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The persons named participated in the 2000 extensification premium scheme opting for the census system.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the relevant EU regulation governing extensification premium, where the movement of bovine animals out of a herd is restricted on a census date or within a 20-day period immediately following a census date, due to an outbreak of tuberculosis-brucellosis, a co-efficient of 0.8 is applied to the livestock unit value of the bovine animals present on the census date in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of 2000, the herd of the persons named was restricted under tuberculosis regulations on the second, third, fourth and fifth census dates. The 0.8 co-efficient was applied to <Col N="1302" /> the livestock unit value of bovines present on the holding on these four dates.</P>
    <P>In order to compensate herdowners for the loss of markets during the autumn of 2000 resulting from the BSE crisis, a separate EU regulation provided for the granting of a BSE marketing difficulties concession to herdowners who could prove that they experienced genuine marketing difficulties in the disposal of cattle in the period 15 October 2000 to 31 December 2000. The fifth census date fell within this period. Under EU regulations, the tuberculosis-brucellosis concession and the BSE marketing difficulties concession cannot be both applied at the fifth census date.</P>
    <P>Since the stocking density of the persons named was in excess of 2.00 livestock units per hectare after granting the appropriate concessions, they cannot be considered for payment of 2000 extensification premium at the low rate of payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 to 152, inclusive, and No. 164 together.</P>
      <P>The CLÁR initiative, launched last October by Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, will focus on disadvantage in selected rural areas. Rural disadvantage is manifested by dispersed, declining populations and the Government is determined to put an end to this disadvantage in rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas selected under CLÁR are those which have suffered the greatest depopulation since 1926, with the exception of the Cooley peninsula, which has been included based on the serious difficulties caused by foot and mouth disease. The average population loss in these selected areas is 51% and the total population that will benefit from the programme is 284,000. The 16 <Col N="1304" /> areas in the programme include parts of the counties of Connacht-Ulster, parts of five counties in Munster as well as parts of four counties in Leinster.</P>
    <P>CLÁR will fast-track national development plan spending in the selected areas through reprioritisation of spending measures in the NDP relating to physical, social and community infrastructure. An extra dedicated budget of &euro;12.7 million per annum has been allocated to ensure the success of the programme in 2002 and 2003. This fund will be directed towards special projects that might not otherwise be funded, even under reprioritisation of the NDP. The bulk of this money will be spent on public and community infrastructure, e.g. broadband, roads, water, sports facilities, health services and education, which have largely been identified by the communities themselves. For that purpose, following the launch of the programme, Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív engaged in a public consultation process involving meetings with the county councils and the county development boards in the selected areas and the public at large.</P>
    <P>The programme is being implemented by my Department in consultation with the communities themselves and the relevant county development boards. A CLÁR section has been established within my Department which is in constant contact with the county development boards, the county councils and the other Departments and State agencies involved in implementing the programme. The county development boards' strategies, now being finalised, provided an important basis for identifying the priorities in the CLÁR areas.</P>
    <P>The priorities identified are being dealt with in three modules: local authority &ndash; roads, water, sewerage, village renewal, coastal erosion, piers &ndash; industry, enterprise and tourism, health, education and community.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is in discussion with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the county councils to copperfasten the funding mechanisms under module 1 and has already agreed and announced procedures for supporting group water projects, non-national roads and small water and sewerage schemes in CLÁR areas. It is anticipated that further measures and funding for individual projects in selected areas under this module will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that CLÁR will not set up parallel structures to the existing agencies, thus creating further duplication and bureaucracy, and is implementing its programmes, including selection of individual projects, through the agencies with day to day responsibility for the different programmes and in consultation with the relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>A very broad range of projects will be supported under the programme and it is hoped to finalise the allocation of this year's funding across each category shortly.</P>

At an inspection of their flock on 17 April 2000 only 32 ewes were presented. As the number of unnotified losses exceeded 20% they were deemed ineligible for payment under the terms and conditions of the schemes. Following appeals by solicitors on behalf of the applicants, this decision was upheld by the Department's district inspector and by the appeals unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of milk quota from the national reserve is granted on the basis of recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. The tribunal is a body established to consider applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the introduction of the milk quota system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal gives priority to the following categories of producers: small scale producers whose entitlement to purchase quota under the 2000 and 2001 milk quota restructuring schemes was limited because of animal disease or personal illness <Col N="1306" /> or where insufficient quota was available in the applicant's co-operative-dairy; younger dairy farmers with small milk quotas; producers whose butter fat representative levels are very low; and producers who are in financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>In assessing these applications, the tribunal takes account of the following factors: current quota size; off-farm income and-or other farm enterprises; size of holding; family circumstances, including succession; commitment to dairying; previous allocations from the national reserve. The milk quota appeals tribunal also considers applications for temporary allocations to producers who encounter quota difficulties due to animal disease restrictions. Furthermore, in 2001 the tribunal also examined more than 3,500 applications from producers affected by the foot and mouth disease restrictions, and allocated 34 million litres under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The closing date for receipt of applications to the tribunal for the 2001-02 quota year was 18 January, 2002. Details and forms for the 2002-03 milk quota year will be published early in the new quota year.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for seven animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. Following an examination of his application it was found that according to CMMS records animal tag number GNJP0010A was not on his herd reconciliation profile and there was no record of the animal being moved into his herd. An 80% advance payment of &euro;989.52 based on six animals issued on 26 November 2001. Issue of balancing payments commenced on 31 January 2002 and a recheck of the herdowner's application showed that the situation regarding animal tag number GNJP0010A had not changed. The district livestock office of my Department issued a letter dated 8 February 2002 to the person named advising him to contact the mart where the animal was purchased and to have the movement details for this animal updated on the CMMS database. The application will then be processed for final payment.</P>

Once these pensioners reach the age of 66, however, the amount of their early retirement pension must be reduced by the amount of widows or widowers pensions that they receive.</P>
      <P>This was already the position under the previous early retirement scheme and the Commission's agreement relates to the new scheme. It is a requirement of the European Council regulations governing both schemes of early retirement that the early retirement pension may only be granted as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, or his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, may receive.</P>

The closing date for receiving applications for the 2002 national reserve was 31 August 2001 and an application cannot be considered at this stage.

      <P>On 30 January 2002, the owner of the farm referred to by the Deputy reported to my Department that 14 untagged sheep belonging to an unknown third party were present on his land. Under the national sheep identification system, NSIS, introduced on 21 June 2001, all sheep were required to be tagged upon leaving the farm of origin, or by 15 December 2001, at the latest. The stray sheep referred to were not tagged and were slaughtered in accordance with the provisions of the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 to 2001.</P>

    <P>The introduction of a national sheep identification system was widely publicised in the agricultural media and elsewhere, and information packs detailing its requirements have been sent to flockowners.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department continually monitors and analyses the emerging budgetary position. On budget day 2001, current receipts were estimated at £24.522 million and the outturn at year-end was £22.633 million. A number of factors contributed to the shortfall in tax receipts. Overall economic growth was lower than expected on budget day. Budget 2001 was predicated on a forecast of 8.8% for real GDP growth for the year 2001. This economic forecast was based on the latest national and international data available to my Department at that time. Underpinning my Department's view of world growth was the EU Commission's autumn 2000 forecasts which expected growth considerably higher than that actually achieved.</P>
      <P>My budget 2001 forecasts were not out of line with what was widely believed, at that time, as the likely growth scenario for this economy. The Commission autumn 2000 forecasts expected real GDP growth of the order of 8.25%, the OECD and the Central Bank about 8% and market commentators' forecasts did not differ substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lower economic growth due to the unforeseen outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and related restrictions as well as to the effect on us of the slowdown in the United States economy, <Col N="1313" /> exacerbated by the terrible events of 11 September generated less tax receipts than expected, especially in the areas of income tax, value added tax and excises.</P>
    <P>The methodology used to estimate the level of tax receipts in 2001 was similar to that used in recent years and was detailed in the report of the tax forecasting methodology review group, which is available on my Department's website. The forecasting methodology is kept under review by my Department. When new data becomes available new estimates can be made of the cost of tax changes. This factor added to the budget day cost in 2001 in the case of income tax.</P>
    <P>The 2001 Revised Estimates published in March 2001 provided &euro;20.268 billion for net voted current expenditure and &euro;4.687 billion for net voted capital expenditure &ndash; a total of &euro;24.955 billion. The 2001 outturn for net voted spending included in the end-December Exchequer statement was &euro;25.308 billion, including the impact of balances. This gives an overall excess of &euro;353 million or 1.4% of the total Estimate. Of that total, net voted current spending was &euro;20.404 billion &ndash; giving an excess of &euro;136 million or 0.7% of the net current REV provision &ndash; and net voted capital was &euro;4.904 billion &ndash; giving an excess of &euro;217 million or 5% of the REV net capital provision.</P>
    <P>A number of reasons contributed to the increased current spending including, <i>inter alia</i>, a shortfall in ESF receipts, additional expenditure on health services and the cost of measures introduced to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. Additional spending in these and other areas was offset by emerging savings across all Departments. The increase in capital spending was due to infrastructural development on roads, water and waste services and additional spending on education and health capital projects.</P>

      <P>The statement made by the Director of Consumer Affairs to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 21 November last was wide-ranging and touched upon many issues. Among the issues addressed was the matter of restrictions in cheque encashment procedures. The director observed that many institutions seemed to have amended their cheque encashment procedures at the same time. She expressed the belief that these amendments may <Col N="1314" /> have arisen from a decision of the Irish Payment Services Organisation, IPSO, which controls entry to the cheque settlement system. She said she had advised the Competition Authority of her concerns in this matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific issue of the changes in cheque encashment policy which occurred towards the end of 2000 and early 2001, my Department have no statutory function in this area. However, as a result of representations from my Department with the Bank of Ireland and AIB, several proposed changes in cheque encashment practices which would have seriously inconvenienced customers, were postponed or withdrawn, including that the new system would not apply to certain pension payments. In addition, my Department were in correspondence with the ODCA, in which we sought to address the concerns expressed by the director on this issue.</P>
      <P>As regards the general issue of control of the retail payments system, it should be noted that the Competition Authority are the most appropriate body to pursue any such inquiry into alleged uncompetitive practices. I understand that although the Competition Authority expressed concerns about the level of competition in the Irish banking industry, no abuses of competition law have been sustained against the banking sector.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there was considerable flooding in Limerick over the Christmas and new year in 1999-2000. However, a certain area of the city was more severely affected due to public works associated with the Limerick main drainage scheme being carried out by Limerick Corporation on the Abbey River. Due to these works the receding of flood waters was delayed in that area and as a result residents there suffered additional hardship. It was the intention to provide financial assistance only to those who had suffered additional hardship because of the public works and the scheme was established on this limited basis. The scope of the scheme was determined solely on the basis of a report on the flooding from Limerick Corporation which indicated the area and the properties affected as a direct result of the public works. The area identified was the immediate vicinity of Athlunkard Street adjacent to the Abbey River and a small number of other properties on the opposite bank. The five homes referred to on the Mill Road in the Corbally area are outside this designated area and, therefore, they were outside the scope of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that the flat rate scheme which applies to unregistered farmers seeks to compensate them for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services. The scheme sets out a percentage amount known as the flat rate amount, which is currently 4.3%. Unregistered farmers add this amount to their prices when they sell their produce to VAT registered businesses.</P>
      <P>Farmers as with most taxable persons have the option to register, if they choose. However as most food supplied by farmers is zero rated, they would be in a permanent VAT repayment position if they were required to be registered. This would create significant administrative burdens for both the farmers and the tax administration. The flat rate scheme avoids the need for such farmers to comply with the normal VAT registration and record keeping rules and relieves the State of a significant administrative burden. There is also direct legal provision for the farmers flat rate scheme in the sixth EU VAT directive.</P>
      <P>Article 24 of the sixth VAT directive does provide for member states, which might encounter difficulties in applying the normal rate scheme to small undertakings by reason of their activities or structure, under conditions as they set out themselves, to apply simplified procedures such as flat rate schemes for the charging and collecting of tax, provided there is no reduction in the amount of tax to be collected. Any such change could only be made subject to consultation with the VAT committee in Brussels. Any change in the treatment of such persons would have to comply with the requirements set out in the directive before it would be possible to make any change.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that the conditions exist within the building industry as required under the terms of the directive which would meet the requirements for such a change to be made at this time.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, under the provisions of section 114, TCA, 1997, an employee is entitled to claim a tax deduction for expenditure wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of his or her employment. The level of qualifying expenses is not related to the skill of the worker concerned.</P>
      <P>A flat rate expenses deduction is allowed to many groups of workers so as to avoid the necessity for each individual to make a separate claim. The amount is normally negotiated by a representative body &ndash; for example, trade union or association &ndash; on behalf of its members and this is reviewed periodically, on receipt of a claim by that body, to reflect changes in costs, conditions of work, etc.</P>
      <P>In the case of the building trade the following flat rate expense allowances apply:</P>

      <P>The humanitarian aid scheme to assist those who suffered severe hardship as a result of the flooding on 1 and 2 February 2002 is being administered on behalf of the Office of Public Works by the Irish Red Cross Society and has been put into immediate effect. The closing date for completed applications for aid is Friday, 1 March 2002. Advertisements giving full details of how to apply for assistance under the scheme first appeared in the national newspapers on 7 February. Radio and television adverts for the scheme were also broadcast on 8 February. The advertising campaign will continue in all media at regular intervals throughout the application per<Col N="1318" /> iod. In addition, a number of public meetings took place on 6 and 7 February in the worst affected areas in Dublin at which Dublin City Council, Office of Public Works and Irish Red Cross officials explained the aid scheme to the large numbers present. The criteria under which people can claim are death; serious injury; homelessness; damage to home; loss of income; and extreme hardship. On receipt of applications, Irish Red Cross assessors will make appointments to meet the applicants.</P>
      <P>Assessments have already started in some areas. The Irish Red Cross has tremendous professional expertise in administering humanitarian aid schemes and is confident that all applications will be processed and payments made within eight weeks of receipt of application. It is emphasised that the scheme is designed to provide humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship and to enable people to get their life back on track. It is not compensation for everything that may have been lost. Applicants who have insurance may still claim for humanitarian aid but should claim from their insurance company in the first instance. All details in relation to insurance must be completed in the humanitarian aid application form. I am confident that the Irish Red Cross will deal with all applications for aid speedily, impartially, effectively and in complete confidence.</P>

      <P>An owner-occupier will pay no stamp duty on a new property that is less than 125 square metres in size. Where the property is larger than this, stamp duty is paid, at the rate applicable to second-hand property, on either the value of the site or a quarter of the value of the house and site combined, whichever is the greater. If a person, who was leaving their previous home due to a registered disability, was purchasing a new property, they could, therefore, avail of these provisions.</P>
      <P>In relation to the purchase of second hand properties by owner-occupiers in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, I increased the stamp duty exemption threshold for owner-occupiers of second-hand houses from £60,000 to £100,000. This was in recognition of the increases in house prices in recent years and the knock-on effect this was having on stamp duty payable in respect of ordinary houses.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty receipts allow for a broader tax base than would otherwise be possible and form an important element of the State's revenues which permits Government spending on services such as health and education. Stamp duty has always been a broad-based tax with very few exemptions or reliefs and if a concession were given for the type of situation suggested by the Deputy, it could create a precedent for other groups for special treatment. This would reduce the Exchequer yield. While the rates and thresholds are reviewed on an ongoing basis, I have no plans to amend them at this time.</P>

      <P>An employee's contributions to a Revenue approved occupational pension scheme are tax deductible at the marginal income tax rate. The maximum pension payable to an employee on retirement under Revenue rules is two thirds of final salary. However, not all schemes provide for the maximum approvable pension. In these cases, an employee may pay &ldquo;additional voluntary contributions&rdquo;, AVCs, in order to provide extra retirement benefits up to the Revenue approvable maximum. At present, the aggregate of tax relievable contributions to the main scheme and the AVC scheme may not exceed 15% of salary. In order to encourage employees to increase their level of pension cover, I propose to increase the tax relieved limits so that they will range from 15% to 30% of salary depending on age.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals, at present, to designate additional areas under the rural renewal scheme. The rural renewal scheme is a pilot scheme and is focused on a limited and specifically defined part of the State and aimed at the upper Shannon region. It would not be appropriate to consider the designation of other areas until the effectiveness of the scheme in promoting additional economic growth and reversing population decline in the designated area is evident. In addition, an extension to the areas currently designated under the scheme or changes to the business tax reliefs would be subject to European Commission approval under State aid rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area designated under the rural renewal scheme includes all of counties Longford and Leitrim and parts of the neighbouring counties of Sligo, Cavan and Roscommon. The reliefs available under this scheme and the areas to which the reliefs apply were provided for in the Finance Act, 1998. In both deciding the range of reliefs and the areas to be designated under this scheme I was mindful of the fact that counties Longford and Leitrim were continuing to suffer from population declines against the national trend. The 1996 census showed that the populations of both counties Longford and Leitrim had declined while every other county in the State had shown moderate or significant increases. It should be pointed out that in order to maximise the effects of the reliefs available under the scheme, it was of critical importance that the scheme be targeted at both counties Leitrim and Longford. While additional areas in the surrounding counties of <Col N="1321" /> Sligo, Roscommon, and Cavan were also designated for relief under the scheme, it was felt that the designation of further areas would increase the geographical scope of the scheme to such an extent so as to dilute the incentivising effect of the reliefs on the upper Shannon area.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that repayments for all taxes are currently being processed as normal and that a new computer system, integrated taxation processing, ITP, has, in fact, enhanced the repayments process. However, delays were experienced by some taxpayers due to initial teething difficulties with the extension of ITP to the assessed tax collection system last September. The Revenue Commissioners advise me that these difficulties have since been resolved. Repayments of corporation tax, capital gains tax, income tax, VAT, and PAYE/PRSI numbering 101,984 to the value of &euro;328,301,867 have been made by the Revenue during the period from 1 January 2002 to 13 February 2002.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the ITP system for income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax last September, repayments below a certain level &ndash; at present &euro;4,000 &ndash; which represent almost 70% of income tax repayments, are issued automatically following processing of the return. The corresponding figure for corporation tax repayments is 45%. These repayments now issue within seven days from the issue of the notice of assessment.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 1006A, TCA 1997 repayments are offset against a taxpayer's outstanding tax liabilities or deferred in cases where tax returns are outstanding. Taxpayers are advised where these circumstances arise. When the outstanding returns are received the repayment is processed.</P>

The non-life levy remained at 1% until 1993 when it was increased to its current rate of 2%.

      <P>I take it the focus of the Deputy's concern is the impact of the fall in share values of the bank in question, and of the general financial status of the bank. The shares of this bank form a significant portion of the Irish equity market. It is inevitable that the initial fall in its share price had an adverse effect on the index of Irish share values. However, I understand that the bank's share price has since recovered much of its initial fall. I am advised that the bank's capital position is strong and is comfortably within established limits. There is no threat to account holders or to the solvency of the bank. Financial institutions and fund managers operate risk management policies which ensure that exposure to unexpected events such as this are minimised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the reductions in personal taxation effected since the Government came to office in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of personal taxation may be influenced by movement in any or all of the following: income tax rates; income tax bands; and income tax credits. As a result of changes introduced in <Col N="1324" /> the last five budgets, both the standard and top rates of tax have been reduced by six percentage points each from 26% to 20% and from 48% to 42%, respectively.</P>
    <P>The standard rate band, which affects the point at which a person will begin to pay tax at the higher rate on his or her income, has also been widened considerably since 1997. Before the Government came into office, the single person's standard rate band stood at £9,900, &euro;12,570. Having regard to this and to the basic personal allowances as they were then, a single person with an income above &euro;17,268 , £13,600, became liable at the top rate of tax. After Budget 2002, the band for a single person stands at &euro;28,000 which is higher than the average industrial wage. Above this point, the person becomes liable to the top rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The main personal credits &ndash; formerly allowances before the move to tax credits &ndash; that is, the basic personal credit and the employee PAYE credit have also been increased and now stand at &euro;1,520, £1,197, and &euro;660, £520, respectively. The result is that no income tax is paid on income of less than &euro;209, £165, per week &ndash; equivalent to 90% of the current minimum wage of &euro;233, £183, per week. By comparison, in 1997 a single person entered the tax net at just under £77, &euro;98, per week.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above positive changes in personal taxation, there have also been reductions in the burden imposed on individuals by PRSI and levies. Overall, the significant reductions in the burden of personal taxation can be gauged from the fact that the average tax rate &ndash; that is, the effect of income tax, PRSI and levies combined &ndash;  faced by a single person on the average industrial wage has fallen from 27.6% in 1997 to 16.8% today.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190, 203 and 204 together.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme is ongoing. The group was set up in 1998 and is chaired by an official of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group has met on 25 occasions to date. I understand that their work is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>The work of the review group is complex. As part of its deliberations, the group has heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days and has received over 260 written submissions from interested parties. While definitions of disability vary, I have been informed that there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with less severe medical conditions than those which are covered by the scheme and persons with medical conditions which are not covered by the scheme. The substantial tax benefits of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme make for considerable interest in and desire to be admitted to the scheme. Therefore, many factors have to be taken into account by the review group and many interests balanced. This work and analysis takes time.</P>
      <P>The report will be published once the deliberative process is fully completed. Until such time, I believe that it is not appropriate to comment further on the actual workings of the review group.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 202 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 of the Finance Bill, 2002, provides for the introduction of a new scheme of relief from income tax on the direct sports earnings for Irish resident sportspersons involved in certain sports. Qualifying sportspersons, whether in a <Col N="1326" /> professional or semi-professional capacity, will be entitled to an annual deduction from earnings from direct participation in their particular sport of the order of 40% for up to ten years of assessment back to and including the tax year 1990-91 provided the sports person was resident in the State in these years. Eligible income under the scheme will arise from direct participation in the sport and will not include income accruing from sponsorship, advertising or endorsements. The relief can be claimed in the year in which the sportsperson ceases to be permanently engaged in that sport, provided the individual is resident for tax in that year, and will be provided by way of repayment of tax.</P>
    <P>The categories of sportspersons that can avail of this relief are listed in Schedule 23A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which provided higher contribution limits for retirement annuity purposes. These categories are an athlete, badminton player, boxer, cyclist, footballer, golfer, jockey, motor racing driver, rugby player, squash player, swimmer and tennis player. There is scope for the Minister for Finance to add to this list by regulation after consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation if a justifiable case is made on behalf of categories of sportspersons with direct earnings that are excluded.</P>
    <P>This scheme is based on an approach that income earned from direct sporting activities should have a treatment that recognises the particular challenges and achievements that arise in earning that income and the short earning career involved. Of its nature it can only apply where sports earnings are involved. This means that it is only those sportspersons that derive income from participation in their sport that can benefit. As amateur sportspersons are not paid for participating, the measure obviously does not apply to them.</P>

      <P>On the basis of details supplied, the Deputy's concerns relate to the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme, purchase scheme and scheme for professional added years. I understand the spouses' and children's scheme is being finalised at present. The final version will be submitted, firstly, to my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and then myself for signing off. My Department has no objection to members of the staff of the authority who were recruited by the authority in a professional, technical or specialist capacity being considered for an award of added notional years of pensionable service on the basis of the scheme <Col N="1327" /> for the award of such &ldquo;professional added years&rdquo; by State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>Members of the staff of the authority who were formerly civil servants who were entitled to be considered for an award of added notional years of service for superannuation purposes under section 6(3) or 6(4) of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, and who are designated by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in accordance with section 20 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, may also be considered for an award of added notional years of pensionable service on the basis of the scheme for the award of &ldquo;professional added years&rdquo; by State-sponsored bodies. It should be noted that section 21 of the Act provides that such designated persons shall not be granted superannuation benefits on terms and conditions which are less favourable than the terms and conditions which applied to them in relation to such benefits immediately before being transferred to the Authority.</P>
      <P>In relation to purchase of service for superannuation purposes, my Department indicated to the authority in May 2000 that it had no objection to draft arrangements for the purchase of such additional notional years of service by members of its staff which were submitted by the authority. Contributions in respect of purchased service are normally deductible for tax purposes in accordance with the rules for the tax treatment of pension contributions laid down by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals for the introduction of capital allowances for the purchase of sugar beet contracts. The purchase of sugar beet growing contracts does not involve a transfer of quota as is the case with milk quota. The milk quota restructuring scheme was introduced on foot of EU directives and a Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development policy initiative for national agricultural policy reasons. A sugar beet contract restructuring scheme was put in place in 2000 by agreement between Irish Sugar plc and the Irish Farmers Association. Under that scheme a grower who wished to surrender a contract could nominate another grower to take the contract. If Irish Sugar plc agreed to the nomination, a portion of the tonnage involved would become available for reallocation.</P>
      <P>The operation of the scheme is a matter entirely for the company and the growers and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has no function in the matter. The purchase payments in question are not in respect of an actual purchase of a quota but are paid by individuals to other individuals in respect of nominations for sugar beet growing contracts. There is no actual transfer of quota involved in these transactions and for all these reasons I have no plans for the introduction of capital allowances for the cost incurred in securing the transfer or otherwise of sugar beet growing contract nominations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to comment in detail on the specific operations performed by the officers aimed at countering drug smuggling. However, the Commissioners advise me that visits were made under the customs drugs watch programme which I mentioned in my previous reply; on information/ intelligence gathering duties; to implement customs controls; to support national and international operations &ndash; conducted jointly with other enforcement agencies from abroad &ndash; aimed at preventing drug smuggling; and on revenue-related duties. The Commissioners further advise me that there have been no seizures of controlled drugs or other prohibited goods by customs at Weston in the past five years.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from the Revenue Commissioners' annual reports of the very substantial seizures of drugs, tobacco and other prohibited goods that have been made in recent years by officers of the Customs and Excise Service.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they review and update all return forms used on an annual basis. The form 12 for the &ldquo;short&rdquo; tax year for 2001, had to be revised to take account of: budget changes; the change to the euro; and the change to the calendar tax year.</P>
      <P>In previous years, the form 12 has been generally available for completion one month after the end of the tax year. While there has been a slight delay this year given the number of changes required, the form 12 for 2001 is now available from Revenue's website since 18 February 2002 and will be available from tax offices throughout the country from 25 February.</P>
      <P>I understand from Revenue that PAYE taxpayers have not been disadvantaged or unfairly treated by the fact that the form 12 for 2001 is only now available. Revenue's practice is to accept claims in the majority of PAYE cases without the completion of a return form. As in previous years, claims are accepted by Revenue, at any time, on the submission of a form P60 &ndash; a statement of pay and tax &ndash; together with a written claim to repayment. The number of such claims for the year 2001, which were dealt with since 1 January 2002, is 13,004.</P>

      <P>Significant progress has already been made in implementation of the PPF and, to date, seven progress reports have been presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the social partners. However, as agreed with the social partners, the pace of progress has to reflect economic growth. The likelihood of growth below the PPF forecasts this year therefore requires us to be flexible, while maintaining our capacity to accelerate the rate of progress over subsequent years. This underlines the importance of positioning the country to take full advantage of a recovery in the face of global economic activity when it comes. In this regard safeguarding our competitiveness, including maintaining adherence to the terms of the PPF, remains vitally important.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would appear to be referring to the consideration by the ECOFIN Council of a number of member states' stability programme updates on 12 February 2002 in which I participated. These updates set out the budgetary projections for these member states. ECOFIN considered the Commission's proposal to issue a recommendation for an early warning to prevent an excessive deficit to Germany and Portugal. ECOFIN welcomed the commitment of the German and Portuguese Governments to endeavour to ensure that the 3% of GDP deficit limit will not be breached and that no measures which could worsen the budgetary position will be introduced. ECOFIN also welcomed the fact that both member states remain committed to reaching a budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus by 2004. On foot of these commitments by the two member states concerned, ECOFIN considered that they had responded effectively to the <Col N="1332" /> concerns expressed in the Commission recommendation. Therefore, the proposed recommendations for early warnings to be given to Germany and Portugal were not put to a vote and were not proceeded with. Council opinions in relation to both member states' stability programmes were unanimously agreed.</P>

      <P>The national debt was estimated to be &euro;36.50 billion at 31 December 2001. This was some &euro;10 million below the end-2000 level of &euro;36.51 billion. The likely national debt figure for end-2002 is dependent on a number of factors of which the most important is the Exchequer balance out-turn for 2002. It is currently projected that the Exchequer will be in surplus by &euro;170 million at the end of 2002. However, over the course of 2002, the level of the national debt will be affected by other factors such as foreign exchange movements and discounts and premia on debt issuance and cancellation. A more meaningful indicator of sovereign indebtedness however is the general Government debt, GGD, which is the standard measure used within the EU. The general Government debt to GDP ratio fell from 38.6% of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 35.8% in 2001. It is projected to decline further to 33.7% of GDP in 2002. This is the second lowest national debt in the EU, relative to GDP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 to 215, inclusive, 257 to 261, inclusive and 268, 292, 293 and 294 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following legal advice from the Attorney General, I revoked the Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996 (SI No. 152 of 1996), which set out criteria and procedures to be used by the chief executive officer of a health board when determining applications for granting community pharmacy contracts. The effect of the revocation for the awarding of new community pharmacy contracts is that there are no restrictions on granting new contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The revocation does not affect the operation of the community pharmacy scheme, and existing contracts still stand. All existing contract applications and appeals lapsed with the regulations. Those affected should contact the relevant health board directly concerning re-<Col N="1335" /> applying. The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as the planning Act.</P>
    <P>The pharmacy review group established by my Department to examine the pharmacy issues raised in the OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland is now being asked to report as quickly as possible, given the new situation. The type of framework, whether statutory or otherwise, required for community pharmacy services will be considered when the group reports. I am considering a number of options pending the completion of the work of the group. I have already met with representatives of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to discuss their concerns following the revocation of SI No. 152 of 1996. A further meeting will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>A central element of the community pharmacy contractor agreement between health boards and community pharmacists is clause 9 of the contract. This provides for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. On completion of the above mentioned review, the pharmacist shall offer to discuss with the individual for whom the prescription is issued, or with the carer of that person, all such matters as the pharmacist, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, deems significant. It will also include counselling the patient on the importance of compliance with the directions for use of the medicine, techniques for self-monitoring during therapy and the need for patient compliance and the action to be taken in the event of a missed dose. I do not envisage any change in the operation of clause 9 as a result of the revocation of SI No. 152 of 1996.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Pharmacy Act, 1962 provides for the keeping of open shop for the dispensing of medical prescriptions and sale of poisons. The legislation does not restrict the ownership of pharmacies but provides that the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions must be under the personal supervision of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; as defined under section 2(3) of the Act. A shop for the sale of poisons must also be under the personal management of an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; as defined under Section 2(3). The European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications In Pharmacy) Regulations, 1987 (SI No. 239 of 1987) and European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications in Pharmacy) Regulations, 1991 (SI No. 330 of 1991) amended the Pharmacy Act, 1962 to further define an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;. The purpose of SI No. 239 of 1987 and SI. No. 330 of 1991 was to give statu<Col N="1336" /> tory effect in this country to EEC Council Directives 85/432/EEC, 85/433/EEC and 85/584/EEC. These regulations provide for the mutual recognition of qualifications in pharmacy in respect of nationals of member states and include the provision that a pharmacy in this State which has been in operation for less than three years shall not be managed or supervised by a pharmacist who qualified in another EC member state. There is no reason to suppose that unsuitable persons are involved in the operation of pharmacies. If the Deputy has any specific concerns in this regard I suggest that he contacts the relevant health board directly.</P>
    <P>My Department is working on a framework for a pharmacy Bill to rationalise and update the pharmacy Acts, 1875-1977. The issue of fitness to practise in relation to a number of professions, including pharmacy will be addressed. The overall increase in community pharmacy contracts under the 1996 regulations was approximately 50. Of these, about half are outside urban areas. However, applications for rural areas were also refused by health boards under the population, distance and viability restrictions of the 1996 regulations. Therefore, the overall effects of the 1996 regulations are not clear. The pharmacy review group will be studying the extent to which the 1996 regulations achieved the objective of a wider geographic spread of pharmacy services. An assessment of the effects of revocation of SI No. 152 of 1996 on geographic spread, without data on the achievement of this objective would be merely speculative.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority, in respect of the provision of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. However many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been <Col N="1337" /> and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. My Department is also undertaking a number of short, medium and longer term measures to increase the availability of trained staff in these areas.</P>
      <P>I understand from the South-Western Area Health Board, which provides services for children with autism on behalf of the authority, that where speech and language therapy services cannot be provided directly by the board, arrangements are in place to provide a grant to the schools in which the special classes for children with autism are located to assist in enabling the children to access these services. My Department has asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme from 1 July 1999. Previously, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme were being reimbursed under the community drugs schemes. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services, GMS, and the drugs payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. In order for any item of medicine to be included in the common list of items reimbursable under the community drug schemes, it must comply with a list of criteria. These range from the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. Phosphate enemas are low cost products which are available in pharmacies without prescription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be pleased to know that catheters are included in the common list of reimbursable items. However, if difficulties are being experienced it may be that a particular catheter is no longer listed if it is not in conformity with current good practice in the use of these products. In that event the patient should contact his/her <Col N="1338" /> local public health nurse or the continence care unit in Dr. Steevens Hospital.</P>
    <P>People who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. Orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in operation. Their purpose is to allow prioritisation of children for orthodontic treatment based on the severity of need. The guidelines cover all cases where there is a recognised medical need for treatment. At present, the guidelines do not allow for cases where the need is based purely on cosmetic grounds. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the December 2001 quarter there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect the number of patients on orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic service such as the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. Six <Col N="1339" /> dentists from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training last October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. My Department has provided &euro;0.541 million in 2002 for specialist in orthodontics training. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence this year are also under way.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the post graduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Capital funding of approximately &euro;1.27 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of &euro;6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which &euro;4.498 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following progress with developments under the initiative: two consultant orthodontists, five specialists in orthodontics, one dental team and two permanent superintendent radiographers have been recruited; a six-surgery facility at Loughlinstown Regional Orthodontic Unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping of an additional five-surgery unit at the St James's Hospital Orthodontic Unit has been completed and the unit is now operational; three orthodontic managers have been recruited in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to manage the orthodontic services of the area health boards. Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan, both of which are operational, and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board, who was appointed last year.</P>
    <P>In instances where children are not deemed to be within the guidelines, parents can avail of tax relief if they decide to have treatment provided privately. For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, initiatives which I have set <Col N="1340" /> out above will bring about an improvement in waiting times and I am considering other options whereby children who have been waiting for an extended period can be treated free of charge privately. Tax relief is also available for patients on the waiting list who wish to make private arrangements themselves for treatment.</P>

      <P>Persons suffering from any of the following conditions, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme: mental handicap, mental illness (for persons under 16 years only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>

Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, other than for persons aged seventy years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief <Col N="1342" /> executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the new national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, A Health System For You, launched by the Government. The strategy outlines a number of measures designed to improve eligibility for health services which the Government has committed itself to introducing over a number of years. Among the measures proposed is an increase in access to medical cards. In addition to the recent extension of eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over, the strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability.</P>
      <P>The strategy sets out a blueprint for ambitious and wide ranging change across the whole health system over the next seven to ten years. In setting out such a comprehensive and large-scale plan, it is inevitable that prioritising of actions must take place. The strategy represents a clear plan for moving forward which is based on a step-by-step approach to reducing inequalities in the system and building the necessary capacity to meet the growing needs of the population. Services have to be built up, waiting lists reduced, activity increased and specific groups such as children and those with disabilities require targeted service developments. I have already stated that in 2002, the Government's priorities for improving the health system will be: 709 additional acute public hospital beds and 200 beds contracted from the private sector for which &euro;65 million is being made available; addressing waiting lists through a new treatment purchase fund for which &euro;30 million is being made available and commencing implementation of the new model of primary care services for people with a disability and services for older people.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. This situation is compounded by the fact that the provision of orthodontic services is severely constricted due to the limited <Col N="1343" /> availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services.

My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed last year.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that, at the end of the December 2001 quarter, there were 17,295 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,086 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in May 1999. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Adoption Board that the China Centre of Adoption Affairs has advised that it is reviewing procedures for dealing with inter-country adoption applications from all receiving countries, including Ireland. One of the issues raised by the centre was the preparation of post-placement reports which is an important part of the adoption process. Sending countries generally use these reports to evaluate how their children are settling into families in receiving countries. I understand that the China Centre of Adoption Affairs has informed the Adoption Board that it will suspend adoptions between China and other countries unless it receives all outstanding post-placement reports by 31 March 2002. The Adoption Board has written to the relevant adoptive parents as well as health boards and agencies and set a deadline of 28 February 2002 for the receipt of completed reports. I have also written to the health boards to secure their co-operation in meeting the deadline. There are 12 reports outstanding and I have been advised by the Adoption Board that it has been assured that all reports will be forwarded in time for transmission to China. I will continue to monitor the situation in relation to the post-placement reports.</P>
      <P>The China Centre of Adoption Affairs has also decided to impose a quota system with regard to the number of adoption applications that will be accepted from each receiving country during 2002. Ireland has been granted an exemption from the quota system for the year 2002 in respect of applications from married couples. However, in relation to sole applicants a quota system is being imposed. The applications from sole applicants in 2002 should only account for five per cent of total applications sent from Ireland. In 1998, the Adoption Board and the Chinese authorities agreed on working arrangements to facilitate the adoption of Chinese children by Irish residents. I am advised by the Adoption Board that there are no indications that the adoption agreement will be suspended. The board received five referrals from China on 8 February 2002. The Adoption Board and I are satisfied with the very positive working arrangements between ourselves and China. I met with the Chinese Ambassador for a working lunch before Christmas to discuss the working arrangements and I also attended a Christmas party at the Embassy for children adopted from China.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of ambulance services in the Roscommon-Mayo region rests with the Western Health Board. Funding indicated to the board under the national development plan will enable it to advance a range of capital development projects in both its acute and non-acute health services. I understand from the board that the development of an ambulance service in the area referred to by the Deputy is one of a number of areas which are being considered by the board for the development and expansion of the service. It is a matter for the board to progress its capital development projects within the funding indicated to it under the NDP and in the context of its prioritisation of service requirements. Government policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is as set out in a number of policy documents, most notably the report of the review group on the ambulance service, which was published in 1993 and <i>&ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo;</i>, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. I assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to pursue a policy of investment aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the further development of this vital service in the context of the recommendations of the 1993 report, the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy and in response to the priorities identified by the health boards. I will, therefore, continue to provide additional resources for the continuing development of the emergency services nationally to ensure that those calling on the service continue to receive timely and appropriate care. In this regard I am pleased to advise the Deputy that revenue funding of &euro;2.852 million was made available to the Western Health Board in the current year in respect of the continued development and maintenance of its pre-hospital care and ambulance service.</P>

      <P>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy relates to concerns as to whether smoking of tobacco products will be banned in pubs. The Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001 provides for enabling powers for the Minister for Health and Children to prohibit or restrict smoking of tobacco prod<Col N="1347" /> ucts in many public places, including licensed premises. It is reasonable to extend environmental controls on smoking to more public places to ensure protection for the public from the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Following enactment of the Bill, I will be consulting with relevant interests about introducing new regulations to extend environmental controls on smoking to a number of public areas and facilities not included in existing regulations.</P>

      <P>Total health voted spending in 2002 will be of the order of &euro;8,188.582 million, of which capital is <Col N="1348" />&euro;486.575 million and non-capital is &euro;7692.007 million. When compared with the 2001 figures, the capital programme represents an increase of 41% and the non-capital represents an increase of 21% approximately. The budget package of &euro;428 million will allow for a significant number of service developments over and above those initiated in 2001. Overall, the additional funding in 2002 will support additional service provision in major programmes, such as: bed capacity, &euro;40 million; treatment purchase fund, &euro;30 million; intellectual disabilities-autism, &euro;39 million; physical disabilities-training, &euro;47 million; older people, &euro;81 million; child care, &euro;45 million and acute hospitals, &euro;70 million. It should be noted that much of the additional funding will support service initiatives as identified in the new health strategy document <i>&ldquo;Quality and fairness, a health system for you&rdquo;. </i>The letters of determination for 2002 to health boards-authority include funding for these new developments. The service plans approved by the various health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority including provision for these developments in 2002 with the exception of the bed capacity and treatment purchase fund.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the increased funding for services in 2002 will make a further important impact, following four years of continuous increased investment by the Government. Since coming into office this Government has increased spending on the health service by 124%, over the years 1997 to 2001, and despite the enormous pressures and demands, it has, and will in 2002, make a difference. All of the ills within the system cannot be satisfied or remedied within the short-term. In general, the response to the level of funding for 2002 has been positive and I look forward to reviewing progress with the health boards-authority during the year.</P>

The increasing mobility of the global workforce coupled with a need for registered nurses and midwives means that the international recruitment of nurses and midwives will continue for the foreseeable future. The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. However, my Department recently issued a document entitled <i>Guidance for Best Practice on the Recruitment of Overseas Nurses and Midwives</i> . This document was prepared specifically for employers, and includes a set of principles which are fundamental to the development of a model of transcultural nursing and midwifery.

    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> On the face of it, applications from Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US are falling but it should be borne in mind that nursing and midwifery shortages are not confined to Ireland. It is interesting to note that a recent HSEA survey on nursing resources in October, 2001, indicates that recruitment of nurses continues to run strongly ahead of the numbers leaving, with a net increase in the year ending 31 October 2001 of 1,896 nurses in the system. The Deputy may be aware that under European Union legislation an employer must first source possible nursing and midwifery personnel from within the European Economic Area. Professional qualifications are generally compatible and no work permit is required. If recruiting from outside the EEA, a work permit, working visa or work authorisation is required. An employer must also ensure that the applicant's education, training, ability to communicate in English and post-registration experience is consistent with the standards expected of nurses and midwives educated in Ireland. Indeed, language assessment forms part of an ongoing and structured review of personnel in the early stages of employment.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, a period of supervised clinical nursing practice-orientation and assessment may be required by An Bord Altranais for non-EEA nurses or midwives who hold qualifications from countries other than Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the United States. This gives the nurse or midwife the opportunity to give nursing care under supervision, be orientated to the Irish health care system, and to be assessed for full professional registration in Ireland. Such assessment may only take place at sites which have been approved by An Bord Altranais. A national co-ordinator for clinical placements was established by my Department last year to facilitate employers, both in the public and private sector, to arrange such placements. The national co-ordinator is based in the Health Service Employers Agency. Last year the co-ordinator facilitated some 2,047 clinical placements throughout the country for 63 employers.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the Deputy referred held an appointment as registrar of births, deaths and marriages. The administration of the registration system for births, deaths and marriages is primarily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, Registrar-General of births, deaths and marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. Persons appointed registrars, who are not permanent and pensionable employees of the health boards, derive income from fees for regis<Col N="1351" /> trations and fees for the certificates issued by them. These fees are set out in statutory instruments including SI No. 278 of 1987, which sets out the principal fees for the registration of events and the issue of certificates. In particular and limited circumstances a registrar may issue a certificate which is compiled from an entry in a register, in which amendments have been made, and the fees for such certificates are set out in SI 234 of 1987. A review of these fees is ongoing.</P>

      <P>On 11 July, 2001, my Department notified health boards of the introduction of a weekly training bonus, backdated to 1 April 2001, for people with disabilities on approved rehabilitative training programmes. The additional funding allocation to cover the cost of this initiative was also approved. Each health board notified the service providers of rehabilitative training of this development and would have allocated additional funds to them for this purpose. Any instances of non-compliance drawn to the attention of my Department were referred to the relevant health board for attention. My Department has asked each health board to verify, and confirm to the Department, that all authorised trainees on approved rehabilitative training programmes are in receipt of the training bonus. With regard to Sunbeam House, the Department has been informed by the East Coast Area Health Board that all payments to Sunbeam House in regard to authorised trainees on approved rehabilitative training programmes are up to date.</P>

The prioritisation, planning and development of health centres under the national development plan within its functional area, in line with funding available under the NDP, is the responsibility of each health board or the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of the provision of health centres in Riverstown, Glanmire and Blarney, County Cork, this responsibility rests with the Southern Health Board. In the case of Riverstown, the Southern Health Board has advised me that the purchase of a site from the Diocese of Cork is at an advanced stage of negotiation. The design brief for this project has been completed and is being examined by my Department. The board has indicated that it realistically expects to be on site with this project in 2003. In the case of Blarney, the board has advised me that Cork County Council is assisting it in identifying a suitable site for a health centre and that a draft design brief has been prepared.</P>

The Western Health Board accepts the need to build a community nursing unit in Ballinrobe and I concur with that view. Decisions in relation to the prioritisation of funding for projects within the overall allocation available under the national development plan are a matter for each health board in the first instance. In conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, I am currently exploring alternative options for funding developments such as that proposed at Ballinrobe.</P>

Where cervical smears are marked urgent, information points to results becoming available within periods ranging from a matter of days to a fortnight. I am concerned by the long delay experienced by some women waiting for a smear test result. I assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to facilitating a reduction in these waiting times. To this end additional funding has been and continues to be provided for the development of cervical cytology laboratories. In 2001, additional funding in the region of &euro;3.4 million was provided for cervical screening services, <Col N="1355" /> including the implementation of phase one of the national cervical screening programme in the Mid-Western Health Board and the development of cervical cytology laboratories in terms of additional staffing, equipment and the introduction of new technology. This year, an additional &euro;3.2 million has been provided to continue with these initiatives. Under the national health strategy, a commitment has been given to extend the programme to the rest of the country. This is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications. The lessons learned from phase one will facilitate the process of the roll out of the programme. A task force is currently examining the feasibility and implications of the extension of the programme.</P>

      <P>The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children up to two years of age against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice. The schedule of immunisation is in accordance with the recommendations of the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland &ndash; RCPI. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</P>
      <P>MMR vaccine is available under the primary childhood immunisation programme and there is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this programme. There are sound public health reasons for not administering the MMR as separate vaccines. On the basis of currently available information there is no evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccines. Splitting the MMR vaccine into separate components would involve extra injections for children and would cause both children and the people with whom they come in contact to be exposed to these potentially serious diseases for a much longer period of time and be at greater risk of contracting the diseases concerned.  The international consensus is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease &ndash; Crohn's disease. The institutions involved include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the British Committee on Safety of Medicines, the World Health Organisation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &ndash; CDCP &ndash; USA, the American Academy of Paediatrics, UK professional organisations, the RCGP, the Royal College of Paediatrics, the Faculty of Public Health Medicine, the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Most recently, the United States Institute of Medicine also concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease &ndash; Crohn's disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Health Organisation has indicated that observations made regarding the onset of autism following the administration of MMR vac<Col N="1360" /> cine do not meet the scientific criteria required to suggest that the vaccine is the cause. It has also indicated that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. This view is supported by the Irish Medicines Board and by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The Joint Committee on Health and Children in its report on childhood immunisation which was published in July 2001 concluded that there is no evidence of a proven link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that there is no evidence to show that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine. To my knowledge no other country advocates the use of the three separate vaccines rather than the MMR vaccine.</P>
    <P>The Meningitis C vaccine is safe and effective and there is no evidence and no suggestion to my knowledge of a causal relationship between this vaccine and autism. The Irish Medicines Board &ndash; IMB &ndash; is responsible for the monitoring and safety of all pharmaceutical products in Ireland. The monitoring of vaccine safety is ensured through clinical trials prior to licence and post-licence surveillance by the IMB. Vaccines are designed to strengthen the immune system, not weaken it. The MMR vaccine contains 24 different antigens. Antigens are the chemicals that stimulate the immune system to produce immunity to viruses and other foreign substances. We are all exposed to hundreds of times as many antigens every day in the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. The number of antigens contained in the MMR vaccine is minute compared to the total number that the immune system is capable of responding to &ndash; up to 100 billion &ndash; Offit PA et al. I would like to take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility (i.e. medical card holders) or limited eligibility for the health services. Health <Col N="1361" /> boards normally regard a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he/she satisfies the health board that it is his/her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year. Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services, subject only to modest statutory charges from which medical card holders are exempt. However, any patient who elects to be treated privately is liable for the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants fees in addition to the statutory charges. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is liable for the costs relating to such treatment. The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private health care was recommended by the 1989 Commission on Health Funding on the grounds of equity.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Health boards have responsibility for the discharge planning function in their respective areas, in conjunction with individual hospitals. The decision to discharge a patient from hospital to home is a matter for the patient's consultant, based on clinical judgment and assessment of the patient's condition. In respect of the individual cases referred to by the Deputy, it is not possible for the authority to investigate the issues involved in the absence of their particular details. I am conscious of the need for ongoing investment in the discharge planning function. The Deputy may be aware that funding of &euro;40.63 million, £32 million, was approved to help alleviate service pressures and to maintain services to patients. Funding to facilitate improved efficiency in the discharge planning and bed management function was included in this investment package. This was designed to eliminate any avoidable delays in the patient assessment process prior to discharge <Col N="1362" /> home or transfer to an alternative setting. In addition, I announced, in January 2002, the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of &euro;65 million. This represents the first phase of the provision of 3,000 additional acute beds by 2011 as announced in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System For You. The increase in bed capacity will allow the hospital system to significantly increase activity levels for public patients in the current year.</P>

      <P>The second schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect <Col N="1364" /> of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations is the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Section 7 of the second schedule of the regulations states that &ldquo;a health board may consider any asset of the person in respect of whom a subvention has been sought as a source of funding for nursing home care.&rdquo;  Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Second Schedule of the regulations provides that a health board may take the value of specified assets into account, including interest in land, house property, stocks, shares or securities.

      <P>With effect from 1 July last persons aged 70 years and over have had an automatic entitlement to full eligibility under the Health Acts. No difficulties have arisen in cases where a person with automatic eligibility was already attending a general practitioner who holds a GMS contract. Where the general practitioner does not already hold a GMS contract, arrangements were agreed between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation for the issuing of a limited GMS contract in respect of this group of patients. However, it is a matter of personal choice on the part of the general practitioner concerned whether he or she decides to apply for a GMS contract. If the general practitioner decides not to opt for such a contract, and my Department is not aware of any such cases, then the patient will have to select a general practitioner who holds, or is in the process of acquiring, a GMS contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a delay in the actual issuing of contracts to a number of doctors; this arose <Col N="1365" /> because of the necessity to ensure that all of the qualifications of the applying doctors meet the requirements in regard to training as specified under the GMS contract. In this regard, and in an attempt to expedite the process, officials from my Department met with the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Medical Council and, as a result, an agreed tentative proposal went before the council at their meeting recently. Their decision is awaited.</P>
    <P>An interim contract is being prepared at present which will provide a payment mechanism for those doctors who do not currently hold a GMS contract but who have been providing general practitioner services free of charge to their patients since 1 July 2001. This interim procedure is separate from any decision regarding the formal awarding of a GMS contract.</P>

I am advised that the World Health Organisation has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area. The WHO has said that none of the reviews has concluded that exposure to radio frequency, RF, fields from mobile phones or their base stations causes adverse health consequences. However, there are gaps in knowledge that have been identified for further research to better assess health risks. It will take about three to four years for the required research to be completed, evaluated and to publish the final results of any health risks. Mobile phone companies licensed to operate here are required to comply with radio-frequency exposure levels developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, and recommended by the WHO.</P>

However many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiothera<Col N="1368" /> pists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. My Department is also undertaking a number of short, medium and longer term measures to increase the availability of trained staff in these areas.</P>
      <P>I understand from the board that in 2000, specialist training was provided for staff in the unit in question to assist them to develop the communication skills of the children. In 2001, it was agreed that a full time temporary post of speech and language therapist would be assigned to the unit, to work as a member of the multi-disciplinary team involved with the children. This post was advertised but the board has not been successful in recruiting anyone. The board has however been successful in recruiting a senior speech and language therapist to a training post in the disability services and plans to provide continued staff training to the special care unit and to implement a training programme for parents of young children attending this service in autumn 2002.</P>
      <P>My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to reply to the Deputy in relation to the question of specific services for the child in question.</P>

      <P>The pre-employment consultancy service maintained in Northern Ireland by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is compiled from information provided by voluntary and statutory organisations. This information consists of a &ldquo;list&rdquo; of workers, paid employees and volunteers, who have been dismissed, transferred to other work, or have resigned in circum<Col N="1372" /> stances where it is considered they posed a risk to children or adults with learning disabilities.</P>
      <P>No such &ldquo;lists&rdquo; or registers of people deemed &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; or &ldquo;unsuitable&rdquo; to work with children or vulnerable adults are kept in the Republic of Ireland at present. It is my understanding that to introduce such a register would present significant legal and constitutional difficulties.</P>
      <P>However, this is not to say that vetting of workers is not available here. My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has informed me that a central vetting unit has been recently established in An Garda Síochána in response to requests for enhanced clearance system for employment with children and vulnerable young adults. The Garda central vetting unit's primary role is to check prospective employees who as part of their duties will have substantial access to children or vulnerable adults. The unit liaises with the various health boards throughout the country in this regard and is currently developing an enhanced employee clearance system with the objective of meeting growing demands in this area.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that there is ongoing co-operation between the police forces of both jurisdictions in this area and the Garda central vetting unit liaises on a daily basis with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in relation to checks on prospective health board employees who have been domiciled in Northern Ireland. Equally, the Police Service of Northern Ireland liaises with the Garda central vetting unit regarding applicants for positions in Northern Ireland who have been domiciled in this jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>The report of the ombudsman on the nursing home subvention scheme raised certain questions about older persons' entitlement to services. The ombudsman outlined his interpretation of the Health Act, 1970, which is that any person in need of nursing home care has a statutory entitlement to the provision of that service by a health board. My Department's position, based on legal advice which it received, is at variance with the view expressed by the ombudsman. What is clear is that the uncertainty that undoubtedly exists in relation to eligibility and entitlement should be resolved. The new health strategy acknowledges this and indicates that the position in relation to eligibility will be reviewed with legislative proposals aimed at bringing clarity to the situation to be brought forward in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment of child sexual abuse allegations is extremely important and a highly emotive subject. As a result it is of extreme importance that there are clear guidelines on the responsibilities of the statutory agencies involved in this area. These guidelines are clearly set out in Children First, &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which was published by my Department in September 1999. The objectives of the guidelines is to improve the identification, reporting, assessment, treatment and management of child abuse. &lsquo;Children first' is an over-arching national guideline that applies to all individuals and agencies who have contact with children and represent a major development in strengthening arrangements for the protection of children.</P>
      <P>The guidelines clearly set out the following principles of best practice in child protection: the welfare of the child is of paramount importance; a proper balance must be struck between protecting children and respecting the rights and needs of parents-carers and families; but where there is conflict, the child's welfare must come first; children have a right to be heard, listened to, and to be taken seriously. Taking into account their age and understanding, they should be consulted and involved in all matters and decisions which may affect their lives; early intervention and support should be available to promote the welfare of children and families; parents have a right to respect and should be consulted and involved in matters concerning their child; intervention should not deal with the child in isolation, the child must be seen in a family setting; children should only be separated from parents/carers when all alternative means of protecting them have been exhausted. Reunion should always be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total additional funding of &euro;9.47 million has <Col N="1377" /> been made available to assist the implementation of &lsquo;Children First' since the publication of the guidelines. I believe that the &lsquo;Children first' guidelines provide appropriate guidance to health boards on the matters raised by the Deputy, and do not propose to establish a Dáil committee to inquire into these matters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme of representational payment, RP, for councillors which was introduced following extensive consultations with the local government associations, is one element of an overall package of measures designed to enhance the role of local government and the elected member. These include constitutional recognition and guaranteed local elections; a modern legislative framework underpinning the central role of the elected council; updated financial management and personnel systems; a better focus on efficiency, corporate planning and customer service; training for councillors and record funding levels for local authorities.</P>
      <P>As part of this programme the RP is intended to provide practical support for elected members in their work, without losing sight of the important principle of voluntary public service, long associated with the role of the councillor. The level of the RP has been set at quarter of a Senator's salary for county and city councillors and under the regulations will remain so linked for the future. Such linkage provides a mechanism for the RP to increase automatically and safeguards its value in real terms. The payment framework provides for proportionate payments to members of town councils and is somewhat similar to that for the annual allowance.</P>
      <P>The question of payment of the RP is a matter for individual authorities, in accordance with the statutory regulations and rules governing the scheme. Such payments are additional to the existing annual allowance which has been maintained and improved.</P>

      <P>There is a general statutory duty on persons in control of premises, other than a dwelling house occupied as a single dwelling, to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of persons on the premises. My Department has provided assistance in this matter through the publication of a series of the latest guidance documents, the latest of these is &ldquo;Fire Safety in Guest Accommodation (June 2001)&rdquo;. The guidance document sets out widely accepted fire precautions for both the buildings themselves and fire safety management of premises. It advises that a pro-active fire safety management policy should be in place to minimise the risk of fire occurring and to ensure the safety of guests in an emergency. Responsibility for the funding of necessary fire safety measures rests appropriately with the owner of the guesthouse or other accommodation involved. I have no function in relation to the provision of grant aid for tourist accommodation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314 and 315 together.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations, 2001, provide that the 15 cent levy on plastic bags, due to take effect from 4 March 2002, will apply to all plastic bags supplied to customers at the point of sale to them of goods or products to be placed in the bags in any shop, supermarket, service station or other sales outlet. There is an exemption for bags used for non-packaged fresh food products, such as fish, meat, poultry, fruit and vegetables. The dimensions of these bags must not exceed 225 millimetres in width, exclusive of any gussets, by 345 millimetres in depth, inclusive of any gussets, by 450 millimetres in length, inclusive of any handles. Plastic bags designed for reuse and which are sold to customers for a sum of not less than 70 cent are also exempt as are bags provided to departing passengers in ports or airports and on board ships or aircraft. The levy will not apply to plastic primary packaging, in the form of bags or otherwise, containing goods or products, regardless of size or contents.</P>
      <P>Over and above the new levy, necessary measures are required to ensure that systems are set up to provide for the return and, or, collection of used packaging and for the reuse or recovery &ndash; including recycling &ndash; of the packaging waste collected, to assist in meeting packaging waste recovery and recycling targets. In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility initiatives already operating in Ireland in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste, such as Repak, in the case of packaging waste, and Irish Farm Films Producers Group in the case of farm plastics, for example bale wrap. In these cases, producers are required to take steps to recover waste or alternatively to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question. My Department will keep the use of plastic packaging in the agricultural and other sectors under review and will consider whether further arrangements are required to improve its collection and recovery.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318, 322, 334 and 335 together.</P>
      <P>Complaints have been received in my Department regarding, among other things, alleged unauthorised waste activity in County Louth and the response of Louth County Council in regard to these allegations. Under section 59 of the 1996 Act, each local authority is responsible for the supervision and the enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area. Neither functions of this kind nor those in relation to the investigation of unauthorised waste activities have been conferred on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Similarly, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no direct function in the exercise or otherwise by a local authority of the various powers conferred under the 1996 Act.</P>
      <P>Section 60(1) of the 1996 Act empowers the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to give general policy directions to local authorities with regard to specified matters. However, the section explicitly provides that this power shall not be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by a local authority of a function conferred on it by, or under, the 1996 Act. Certain of the allegations received in my Department concerned waste activities at or connected with a facility managed by a company which received grant assistance under the operational programme for environmental services, 1994-99. In the circumstances of this case &ndash; and without prejudice to the legal position outlined &ndash; these complaints are currently being investigated by my Department and I expect to receive a report on the matter very shortly. When I have fully considered that report, I will determine an appropriate course of action. The company concerned was, at the relevant time, considered eligible for the grant assistance concerned, having, among other considerations, satisfied requirements with regard to planning permission, waste permitting and tax clearance. With regard to the possible recovery of this grant assistance, I refer to the reply to Question No. 720 of 30 January 2002.</P>

The Elphin sewerage scheme was included as a longer term objective &ndash; 2006 to 2026 &ndash; in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Roscommon County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available it has not been possible to include it in the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Within this Government's term of office, my Department has commissioned three major reports on the housing market with a particular focus on the supply and demand for housing. The Government responded urgently and comprehensively to the findings of these reports in &ldquo;Action on House Prices (April 1998)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Action on the Housing Market (March 1999)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Action on Housing (June 2000)&rdquo; and has implemented a wide range of measures to reduce excessive house price increases by boosting housing output, removing infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development and discouraging speculative demand. These have included:</P>
      <P>Targeted initiatives and the commitment of significant Exchequer funding to increase the supply of serviced residential land. On foot of these recommendations, there is currently six years supply of serviced residential land nationally and in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The publication of planning guidelines on residential density in September 1999 to help secure efficient use of serviced development land and facilitate the provision of more affordable housing.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a range of measures to expand the capacity of the planning system, including the appointment of additional planning staff to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála and the removal, in April 1998, of mortgage interest relief for investment in the residential housing market and higher rates of stamp duty on such investments with the aim of discouraging speculative demand taking account of more stable housing market conditions.</P>
      <P>These measures have had a very positive effect in moderating house price increases and significantly increasing housing output. The average annual rate of house price increase has been reduced from a peak of around 40% <i>per annum</i> in 1998 to about 5% or 6% last year. That has allowed the Government to reintroduce mortgage interest relief for investors and to adjust stamp duty rates for investors in budget 2002. Last year was also the fifth successive year of record housing output since the Government took office. A total of 52,602 units were completed in 2001, up 5.6% on 2000. A total of 16,498 units were completed in the greater Dublin area, up 6% on 2000, the highest level of output ever produced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Urgent action is being co-ordinated to improve and manage Dublin transport arrangements. This action is intended to bring major benefits in economic terms, in terms of quality of life and in relation to the environment. The Government's national development plan provides for investment of over &euro;2 billion in public transport and traffic management in Dublin in the period to 2006. A further &euro;1.9 billion will be invested in roads in the Dublin region. This represents total investment of almost &euro;4 billion over the life of the NDP. In 2002 alone, approximately &euro;40 million is being provided to the Dublin Transportation Office in respect of traffic management grants, an increase of almost 20% on last year's provision. The Dublin Transportation Office co-ordinates and monitors the implementation of the Dublin transportation initiative strategy. The DTO policy document, &ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo;, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area in the period to 2016.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the strategy is expected to result in a high quality public transport service being available to most people within ten minutes walking distance of where they live. It will increase the share of the market accounted for by public transport from 35% to 65%, reduce congestion and average journey times dramatically, improve accessibility and result in significant environmental gains including reductions in energy use and emissions to below what they would be otherwise. I am confident the comprehensive measures proposed in the DTI strategy will contribute substantially to the alleviation of traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area, with consequent positive economic effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1997, demonstrable improvements in transport arrangements and services have been implemented in Dublin. The Dublin bus fleet has increased, with over 400 new buses having been purchased under the NDP. There was a major expansion of the quality bus corridor network in 2001, with the launch of five new QBCs in the Dublin area serving routes to Blanchardstown, Swords, Tallaght, north Clondalkin and Rathfarnham, together with the extension of the Malahide Road QBC. There are now nine QBCs in place and work is continuing on further routes. Dedicated cycleways have also been extensively provided. In addition, taxi numbers have increased significantly. Improvements have also been made to rail services, including platform lengthening, provision of additional DART and rail cars, extension of the DART service to Greystones and Malahide and the completion of the <Col N="1388" /> Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line. Luas works are also progressing. On 16 January, the Government formally approved the procurement process for a metro in Dublin. There are also a number of major road projects, which are critical to managing Dublin transport. The southern cross section of the C-ring was opened to traffic last year and work is continuing on the final part of the C-ring, the south-eastern motorway, and on the Dublin port tunnel, which will significantly reduce the number of heavy goods vehicles using the city centre. Substantial progress is also being maintained on the M1 northern motorway, linking the Airport to the Balbriggan bypass. These major improvements are vital for improved road capacity and they will substantially complete the major road network around the city area. In addition, plans are under way for the expansion of the M50 and free-flow slips have already been provided at the N4, N7 and Ballymount interchanges. The construction of a second bridge at the West-Link is also under way, designed to alleviate congestion at this pressure point on the motorway.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is proposed to establish a new land use and transport planning body for the greater Dublin area and work is proceeding on drafting of the heads of a Bill with a view to seeking Government approval of the general scheme early this year. The new body will monitor and enforce compliance with existing and future land use and transport strategies and will drive implementation of such strategies with the benefit of improved institutional arrangements and resources.</P>

      <P>Under electoral law, Irish citizens may vote at every election and referendum, British citizens may vote at Dáil, European and local elections, other EU citizens may vote at European and local elections and non-EU citizens may vote at local elections only. The extension of voting rights at Dáil elections followed a referendum on this issue in 1984. Further changes to the right to vote at presidential elections or referendums would require an amendment to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Dublin City Council was advised on 10 April 2001 that funding for the installation of central heating in local authority dwellings may be provided under the remedial works scheme in respect of dwellings which qualify under that scheme or from internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing construction and remedial works scheme programmes. Apart from the foregoing, there is no specific funding mechanism available from my Department for the installation of central heating in local authority rented dwellings.</P>

      <P>I amended the terms of the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme on 27 November last to provide that up to 25% of accommodation in new projects undertaken under the scheme may be allocated to elderly emigrants returning to this country who satisfy the eligibility criteria. With the discretion which already existed under the scheme allowing an approved housing body to allocate up to 25% of accommodation in a project to persons who are not necessarily qualified for local authority housing, bodies who wish to cater particularly for returning emigrants are now in a position to make up to 50% of accommodation in a project available to this category of housing need.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the capital assistance scheme, assistance of up to 95% of the approved cost of a project is available to a voluntary housing body undertaking a project, subject to a unit cost limit of &euro;120,700 in the five county borough areas and in the administrative areas of Fingal, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown and south County Dublin for a one or two bedroom unit. The unit cost limit in the case of projects located on islands is &euro;114,300, while the limit in the case of projects located in other areas is &euro;88,900. In addition, where site costs are included in the cost of a voluntary housing project, the unit cost limits may be increased by the cost of the site, subject to a maximum of &euro;38,100 in the major urban areas as outlined above, or &euro;31,800 per unit in projects located in other areas. As we are still at an early stage in the operation of the amended terms of the scheme, it is not possible to indicate the effectiveness of the scheme in so far as the accommodation of emigrants is concerned. However, the voluntary housing sector is particularly well qualified to meet the needs of our elderly emigrants and it will respond positively to my initiative.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 490 of 6 November 2001, which indicates that Irish <i>per capita</i> carbon dioxide emissions are above, but close to, the average for the EU. The European Environment Agency report, European Community and Member State Greenhouse Gas Emission Trends, 1990-1999 which is available at http://reports. eea.eu.int/topicreport200110/en &ndash; indicates that Ireland has the highest <i>per capita</i> emissions of total greenhouse gases for the EU in 1999. This is calculated on a global warming potential, GWP, basis, and does not include emissions and sequestration from the land use change and forestry sector.</P>
      <P>The difference between Ireland's position when comparing CO2 with total greenhouse gas emissions arises mainly from the disproportionate contribution to total emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the agriculture sector to total emissions from Ireland compared to other EU countries. Both of these gases have a significantly higher GWP than CO2, which is the base gas for comparing the contribution to global warming of all greenhouse gases. The GWP of CO2 is 1, for CH4 is 21 and for N2O is 310.</P>

      <P>The regional traffic management scheme which commenced in 2000 is intended to assist urban traffic management schemes provided by the city councils of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. To date grants of over &euro;5.3 million have been made available under the scheme. Accordingly, applications have not been sought from Kilkenny County Council or Kilkenny Borough Council for inclusion in this scheme. However, these and other local authorities can use the discretionary non-national road grants provided by my Department, together with own resources provision for non-national roads, for traffic management initiatives related to their respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kilkenny County Council's non-national road grant allocation in 2002 is &euro;10.521 million, which represents an increase of 92% on the 1997 provision. Included in this grant provision are discretionary grants of &euro;1.469 million. Kilkenny Borough Council's non-national road grant allocation in 2002 is &euro;505,000 which represents a 246% increase compared to 1997. Again, it is open to the borough council to use its block grant for traffic management purposes. I am satisfied that the significantly increased level of State funding provided in recent years, supplemented by local authorities own resources, is providing adequately for the ongoing maintenance and <Col N="1394" /> improvement needs of non-national roads in Kilkenny, county and city.</P>

      <P>Regulation EC 2037/2000 requires the recovery and destruction of ozone depleting substances contained in domestic refrigerators and freezers from 1 January 2002. In addition, European Commission Decision 2000/532/EC revised the EU list of hazardous waste to include, with effect from 1 January 2002, equipment which contains CFCs. These changes affect the disposal of fridges and freezers manufactured before 1994, which contain CFCs in fridge coolant as well as in the insulating foam. While technology is available in Ireland for the removal of CFCs from the coolants in fridges and freezers, no equipment is yet available for the removal of the insulating foam. The effect of these two instruments is that, with effect from 1 January 2002, fridges and freezers cannot be dealt with by the traditional method of degassing, recovering the metal and sending the remaining waste to landfill.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the absence of treatment facilities in Ireland &ndash; a problem also being experienced in other EU member states &ndash; a number of local authorities have made arrangements for the storage of fridges and freezers.

      <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service was inaugurated in 1992 with the establishment of five pilot projects aimed at building new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending and over-indebtedness. Since then the number of Money Advice and Budgeting Service projects has grown to 52. A total of over &euro;42 million has been provided to the service since 1992. This Government has increased the level of funding from &euro;2.8 million in 1997 to &euro;9.7 million in 2002. A table, detailing the annual allocations, is included as appendix 1 for the information of the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service had some 7,243 new clients in the year 2000, which is the latest year for which such figures are available. As well as new clients, MABS projects have assisted, in the year 2000, significant numbers of people whose cases were carried over into that year from previous years. The MABS programme includes a general money advice element for local communities. It targets families identified as having problems with debt or moneylending, in particular, those dependent on social welfare or on low income. The emphasis is on practical budget based measures aimed at removing people permanently from dependence on moneylenders and opening up alternative sources of low cost credit through credit unions. The service gives advice and assistance but does not pay debts. A consultancy firm has been engaged by my Department to undertake an evaluation study of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service. The purpose of the evaluation was to ensure that the programme was achieving its aims, that it was being operated efficiently, that the objectives of the programme were being met effectively and to facilitate the future strategic development of the service. The findings of the evaluation were that the service is well regarded and is considered both appropriate and effective by the various <Col N="1397" /> stakeholders. The costs of delivering the service were found to be reasonable and to compare favourably to those of other services dealing with disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>The evaluation is ongoing and on completion will inform the strategic development of the service.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since its commencement, a total of &euro;32.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. There has been a further &euro;4.4 million for the scheme in 2002. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the purchase and, or, installation cost of small-scale physical security equipment, such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks, security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant alarm system&rdquo; which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people &ndash; aged 65 or over &ndash; must be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older people who are dependent and vulnerable and unable to install or purchase the equipment covered by the scheme themselves. My Department has not received any requests for the replacement or upgrading of equipment on the grounds that it is in need of upgrading or that it is obsolete. If the Deputy is aware of any such cases, I ask her to provide me with the relevant details and I will arrange to have the matter examined further.</P>

When the water level rises above that necessary for navigation purposes, the sluices are opened so as to aid the flow of water. Waterways Ireland makes every effort to ensure that the sluice gates are kept free from debris and advises me that all gates are inspected at least weekly, with some being inspected on a daily basis.

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>Beats 1 to 4, inclusive, of the River Laune Fishery are State-owned and the rights to these fisheries are held by me. However, in recent years, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has operated a management agreement in respect of beats 1, 2 and 4 with the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board and, in respect of beat 3, with the Laune Salmon and Trout Anglers Association. Both entities have been offered an extension of those agreements for the 2002 season. With regard to the Deputy's inquiry about the number of fish allowed to be caught annually, the position is that while several species of fish &ndash; including salmon, sea-trout, brown trout and eels &ndash; are caught annually on the Laune, figures are available only in respect of salmon catches.</P>
      <P>In this regard, fishing on beats 1 to 4 of the Laune is subject to the same statutory conservation measures as apply nationally. For example, the one-spring-salmon-per-day-per-person prescription which has been recently introduced by the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources. There is also a limit of 24 rods per day on beats 1, 2 and 4 and a limit of ten rods per day on beat 3. This equates to a maximum catch per day of 34 salmon. The rod limits are set and monitored by the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board in order to regulate fishing for salmon on the beats in the interests of safety and conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that salmon is an &ldquo;annex 11&rdquo; protected species under the Euro<Col N="1401" /> pean Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, which is the highest categorisation of protection afforded. Dúchas is working within the catchment management system, established under the auspices of the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources, to agree fishing extraction numbers with all sectors in the overall Laune catchment, with the objective of ensuring that extraction does not exceed sustainable levels.</P>

      <P>My Department has embarked on a considerable investment programme, totalling some &euro;130 million, &ndash; the details of which were announced by me on 5 November 2000 &ndash; in respect of the national monuments and historic properties in my care, under <Col N="1405" /> the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Since all the capital resources which are intended for the conservation and development of the built heritage infrastructure are committed for the foreseeable future, I have no plans to carry out conservation works to this national monument. If the local authority, or any other body, is in a position to undertake this project, I will be happy to provide technical advice and give guidance as to best practice in relation to the works required.</P>

It does not include regular ongoing capital works, such as maintenance, nor does it include capital grants made by the Department in the county during the year. Please note that the information relating to projects commenced or completed in 2001 by Údarás na Gaeltachta reflects total expenditure to date, whereas for other projects, the expenditure shown is that during 2001 only.</P>

      <P>As I already indicated in my replies to Parliamentary Question No. 158 on 22 November 2001, and Parliamentary Question No. 1016 on 30 January 2002, the director general of the Prisons Service established a group to examine all options for Shanganagh Castle in the light of the very considerable decline in the num<Col N="1407" /> ber of young persons in custody found suitable for transfer to this centre in recent years.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that this group, as part of their review, held meetings with a number of interested parties, including the governor and management team of Shanganagh Castle, local staff representatives, officers from the Prison Officers Association, the head teacher of Shanganagh Castle and the Shankill Community Association.</P>
      <P>The group also considered written submissions from the education unit of Shanganagh Castle, the Prison Officers Association, Shankill Community Association, South Shankill Residents Association and the Shanganagh Castle Visiting Committee.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the director general that this group will submit their final report to him in the near future. When this report is received, its recommendations will be considered carefully and circulated to all interested parties. In the event of major changes being contemplated on consequence of the report, a three to four month consultation period will ensue to ensure all affected parties have an input into the eventual outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the areas of training and employment and has taken a strategic approach to policy development involving both legislative and positive action measures to achieve this end.</P>
      <P>The Government brought forward the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which, for the first time ever, provides protection against discrimination in employment and training to people with disabilities. The Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Investigations were established to underpin statutory rights under the Act and to provide a means of redress. I am proud to say that this legislation places Ireland ahead of many other member states in the European Community with regard to the protection for people with disabilities against discrimination in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further significant development was the introduction of mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities in June 2000. As a result of this policy, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS are responsible for the employment and vocational training of people with disabilities. These policies for people with disabilities are now formulated as part of general labour market policy underlining the <Col N="1409" /> move from a medical attitude to disability to an inclusive economic and social view of disability.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has initiated a number of positive action measures to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. These measures include: the launch, in July 2000, of a national supported employment programme to place up to 800 people with disabilities into employment in the open labour market; funding for a social partner initiative, led by ICTU and IBEC, to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector; increased funding for existing employment supports for employers and for people with disabilities; the introduction of new supports such as disability awareness training grants and employee re-training grants; and increased emphasis on progression from vocational training to employment for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In 2000 and 2001, 1,962 vocational training places were available for people with disabilities through specialist training providers funded by FÁS. In addition, people with disabilities can avail of the full range of training programmes and services available directly from FÁS to help people prepare for and find employment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children is responsible for non-vocational, that is, rehabilitative training for people with disabilities through the health boards. In 2002, an additional 500 rehabilitative training places have been approved by the Department of Health and Children in response to additional demand identified by the health boards. The Department is also responsible for sheltered work services. Under a provision of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a working group established by the Department of Health and Children is in the final stages of developing a code of practice for sheltered work. When completed and approved by the Department of Health and Children, adherence to this code of practice will be a pre-requisite of funding for service providers.</P>
    <P>A 3% target applies with regard to the employment of people with disabilities in the public service. This is a Government led positive action measure to facilitate the integration of people with disabilities into employment. Under a Government commitment in the PPF, every Department is required to take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the target at an early date.</P>
    <P>In 1999, the Government established a monitoring committee chaired by my Department to monitor and guide progress towards achievement of this target in the public service &ndash; as distinct from the Civil Service. The committee has supported a number of initiatives over the past two years including: approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities; raising awareness of the 3% target among and giving information to chief executives; personnel officers; and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication <Col N="1410" /> of an information brochure; publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of the 3% target at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April 2001; and commissioning research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations. The report was launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, on the 22 November last year. The report provides an insight into some of the issues which hinder progress and includes recommendations to assist future progress &ndash; copies of the report have been circulated to all public sector employers to inform their future strategies.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department recently published the Disability Bill, 2001. The Bill is a positive action measure to advance and underpin the participation of people with disabilities in everyday life through the removal of barriers and the provision of special supports where these are needed. The Bill will, on enactment, place the 3% target on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness included a commitment to a review of the employment of people with a disability in the Civil Service to ascertain ongoing adherence to the 3% employment target. As at December 2000, the percentage of people with a disability in the Civil Service was 2.6%. The Department is reviewing the operation of the policy with the aim of identifying what steps can be taken to improve its implementation.</P>
    <P>As part of this review, the Department of Finance, in partnership with my Department and the Civil Service Commission, commissioned a study on the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The research is near completion and will be published shortly. It is expected that it will map out the current arrangements in respect of career progression for people with disabilities, highlighting the challenges they face when seeking to progress their careers and will make detailed recommendations for the future.</P>
    <P>All Departments are required to appoint a disability liaison officer to act on behalf of people with disabilities within Departments. In the past year, the Department of Finance has established a network of disability liaison officers which meets regularly. A programme of special training for all disability liaison officers and human resource managers in Departments will commence in March 2002.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission is responsible for competitions with regard to recruitment to the Civil Service. It held a special clerical officer competition between November 1999 and January 2000. The successful candidates were placed on a panel. To date, over 140 assignments have been made from this panel, with some 40 other candidates awaiting clearance and assignment.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out the most recent figures available regarding the number of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service and <Col N="1411" /> separately for the rest of the Public Service as at 1 January 2001.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that there has been considerable dialogue between the project management and ADM Limited, which administers the programme on my behalf and which is also appraising the project proposals. I understand that an independent architectural evaluation of the proposed project is being carried out. This is standard practice in capital projects of this size. This external evaluation is at an advanced stage and I understand that ADM Limited should be in a position to finalise their assessment shortly. The project will then be submitted to the programme appraisal committee before I take a decision on its funding.

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that an applicant under section 49 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, claims that the rights of the registered owner have been extinguished by operation of law under the Statute of Limitations and that he/she is now entitled to be registered as owner. Such cases require considerable expertise and care and often involve detailed consideration. There is no guarantee that any such application made to the Land Registry will be successful. Each application is considered on the facts of the case. Virtually all cases involve further correspondence to satisfy the legal requirements as to the facts of a case and thereafter the service of notices on the parties outlined in the application whose rights, it is claimed, have been extinguished by the passage of time. Typically this process and correspondence with objectors can take a considerable period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the total number of section 49 cases on hand is 2,699. Of this, 1,526 are currently being processed. During the year 2001 the number of section 49 cases completed was 1,202. A number <Col N="1414" /> of additional staff have recently been assigned to this area of work and it is expected that the position will improve throughout 2002.</P>

      <P>This person is serving a five year prison sentence, with the last year suspended, for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He is also serving a three and a half year sentence for handling stolen property.</P>
      <P>This offender has made repeated complaints about the way he perceives he has been treated by the authorities, and in particular the Prisons Service.</P>
      <P>The allegations of ill treatment in Wheatfield Prison on 27 October 2000 have been investigated thoroughly by the governor of that institution who concluded that these allegations were unfounded. In this regard, statements were made by a number of prison officers, all of whom were either not aware of, or deny, the allegations made by the prisoner and his family. During the course of the investigation, a security camera video tape of the alleged incident was examined and, despite the allegations, there is no evidence of aggressive behaviour by any of the prison officers present.</P>
      <P>This matter was also investigated by gardaí at Ronanstown Garda station and a file was forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. No prosecution ensued.</P>
      <P>This offender's other complaints have similarly been investigated by prison management and have also proved to be either without substance or trivial in nature. For example, in November and December 2000, this offender made 30 complaints regarding ill treatment during his time in custody to the visiting committee in Mountjoy Prison. Each of these complaints, which included accusations that his newspapers had gone missing and that the prison library had refused to make photocopies for him, were fully investigated and a report was sent back to the visiting committee.</P>

      <P>The person referred to was sentenced to seven years imprisonment on 25 November 1998 and was then committed to Mountjoy Prison. On 21 December 2001, this sentence was reduced by the Court of Criminal Appeal and he was released from custody.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Director General of the Prison Service that there are no official prison documents known as release papers.

    <P>On his committal to prison, this person gave a particular address and during the course of the sentence he did not request to have this address changed on prison records.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 381 to 383, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Supreme Court, cases which are certified by the appellant as being ready for hearing are included in a list to fix dates. Lists to fix dates are held once or twice a term at which dates for hearing are allocated by the Chief Justice.</P>
      <P>At present, 31 appeals are awaiting dates for hearing. These include a number of appeals previously allocated dates but which had to be displaced to allow the courts to deal with the Abbeylara appeal and three urgent immigration appeals. Dates will be allocated for these appeals at the next list to fix dates which is scheduled for 28 February 2002. In terms of total time, an appeal would normally have a hearing date between three to six months from the date on which it was certified as being ready for hearing. Excluding cases displaced by the Abbeylara and immigration appeals, the oldest case waiting for a hearing date was certified as ready for hearing in late December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the High Court, the position is that under section 10(3) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, as amended, it is the function of the President of <Col N="1417" /> the High Court to arrange the distribution and allocation of the business of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Lists are prepared by list registrars. Cases are listed in chronological order. The date on which cases are entered in the lists depends on the category of case. With the exception of the Circuit appeals list responsibility for the allocation of dates is delegated by the President to the individual judges having management of the various lists. In cases of urgency where an early hearing is requested and no available dates remain the parties may apply to the President who will endeavour to assign a judge to hear the case depending on the availability of extra judges and the urgency of cases. The following are the main High Court Lists.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Dublin personal injury list, once a case is set down the parties may immediately apply for a hearing date two or three weeks from the date of application. Consent applications are taken by the list registrar. Otherwise application is made to the list judge on ten days notice to the other party. There are no delays in this list and the speed with which a case is heard is a matter for the parties. Long cases such as medical negligence actions which can last a number of weeks usually require a date to be &ldquo;specially fixed&rdquo; by the judge, which will depend on the availability of dates but generally a date will be assigned within four weeks of the application being made.</P>
    <P>Regarding personal injury lists at venues outside Dublin, the High Court sits at Cork, Galway, Limerick &ndash; Ennis, when the Courthouse reopens &ndash;  Waterford, Sligo-Letterkenny, Kilkenny and Dundalk to hear personal and fatal injury actions. Cases are listed in chronological order once set down. Applications to fix the list of cases for hearing are heard by the list judge some weeks in advance of the sittings. Cases that are not ready for hearing are adjourned. The only significant delay is in the Cork list where cases can take two years to be reached. In the Dundalk, Kilkenny, Galway Waterford and Sligo, list cases that are ready to proceed will usually be heard within three to six months of setting down. Limerick cases are taking up to 12 months.</P>
    <P>Non-jury and chancery list cases are not transferred to the list to fix dates until certified as ready for hearing. Certified cases are then listed chronologically &ndash; in accordance with the date of filing of the certificate of readiness &ndash; in the next list to fix dates. Certain cases at the top of the list may have been given priority by the list judge where a date may previously have been assigned but the case failed to get a hearing due to the unavailability of a judge. Lists to fix dates are held at the end of each term and most cases that request a date are assigned one the following term. However, some slippage occurred in the past term. As the coming term is relatively short, &ndash; six weeks &ndash; it is unlikely that all cases seeking dates will be allocated a date in the that term but will obtain one in the following term, that is, June-July.</P>
    <P>Regarding the judicial review list, motions for judicial review are not transferred to the list to fix dates until the list judge is satisfied that all pre-hearing directions have been complied with. <Col N="1418" /> Again the list to fix dates is held at the end of each term to fix dates for the following term. Until the end of 2001 all cases seeking dates were assigned a date in the following term. All cases in the last list to fix dates in December 2001 were not reached and arrears have risen. Consequently, cases in this list will not all receive a hearing date next term but should do so in the following term.</P>
    <P>Regarding jury trials, once an action is set down for trial it is entered automatically in the next list to fix dates, according to the setting down date. As there is generally a relatively high number of adjournments and settlements in this list, virtually all cases seeking a date obtain one in the following term.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Dublin Circuit appeals list, Circuit appeals are heard on Monday of each week. Dates are not assigned until the books of appeal are lodged in the central office. The next available hearing date is then assigned by the list registrar which will be approximately four weeks ahead, allowing for the intervention of court vacations. Application is required to be made to the President to assign an extra judge to hear appeals which are expected to last a number of days.</P>
    <P>Regarding Circuit appeals outside Dublin, information on Circuit Court appeals outside Dublin is not readily available.</P>
    <P>Regarding the asylum list, judicial review motions in this category are assigned dates by the list judge periodically during each term. Motions are listed for hearing on a date approximately within four weeks of the motion's coming into the list.</P>

    <P>In so far as the Circuit Court is concerned, the listing of cases in the Circuit Court is the responsibility of the county registrar, subject to the directions of the Circuit judge. The President of the Circuit Court has overall responsibility for the business of the Circuit Court, but is not generally involved with the listing of cases.</P>
    <P>The latest complete figures held are for the year 2000 and the following table shows that the average delay from the time a case is set down until the date of first hearing. Statistics relating to the year 2001 are currently being collected and collated and will be made available to the Deputy when finalised.</P>
    <P>Statistics are not compiled in relation to the number of cases awaiting a listing date. The following table shows the time taken to obtain a hearing. It should be noted that cases can be given a listing date and be adjourned for a variety of reasons. Consequently there are cases which have been listed but adjourned on more than one occasion in several circuit venues and which are several years old.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" />Cases for the Central Criminal Court are presided over by a judge. Once a month there is a list to fix dates. The average waiting time to hearing is about 15 months. As in the Circuit Court, cases may be listed and given a hearing date, but be subsequently adjourned for a variety of reasons.</P>

      <P>The position is that the per<Col N="1421" /> son in question was granted a visa in March 2001 in order to join his spouse in the State. After his arrival in the State he registered with the immigration registration office, Harcourt Square and was granted permission to remain for a further month, up to the expiry date of his wife's permission to remain. He was also advised to return with his wife when her work permit had been renewed in order for his own permission to be extended accordingly. I understand from the Garda authorities that they have no record of his returning in order to do so.</P>
      <P>In order to regularise his position, the person in question should attend the Immigration Registration Office together with his wife and details of her own permission to remain. Consideration can subsequently be given to whether he can be permitted to seek employment, subject to an employer obtaining a work permit in respect of him.</P>

The position is that such renewal takes place at the immigration registration office, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2 for persons resident in the Dublin area and at the relevant Garda superintendent's office for persons residing outside of the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that from time to time requests are made in relation to providing special appointments for persons who, for good reason, cannot attend a Garda registration office during normal working hours. No such request has been received in relation to young non-EEA nationals attending boarding schools in the State. In the event that any such request was made to the Garda authorities, I am informed that every effort would be made to provide appointments outside of normal schools hours or at weekends as appropriate.</P>

      <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Limited &ndash; CSID &ndash; has concluded a contract with Rohcon, Waterworld UK and Dublin Waterworld to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the aquatic and leisure centre on the Abbotstown site. Work on the site began in May 2001, on foot of a letter of intent pending completion of the contract negotiations and CSID is assured that the construction of the pool is on schedule for completion in time for the Special Olympics Summer Games in 2003.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile an overview of the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project conducted by independent consultants HighPoint Rendel &ndash; HPR &ndash; was published on 31 January 2002. The Government has requested me to report on the implications of the HPR recommendations and options and to evaluate: the viability of the existing tendering strategy as a basis for any modification of the stadium design and operation; the implications for the Exchequer of the options and recommendations; and the issues raised in Paragraph 1.7 of the report. Preparations for this evaluation are now under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997, 429 graduates qualified to teach in our training colleges. This Government has increased this number to 1,280 this year, and 1,440 next year.</P>
      <P>In the next four years it is projected that 1,000 undergraduates will graduate from the training colleges each year. In addition it is projected that 280 post-graduates will graduate in 2002 and 440 in 2003. It is projected that 280 post-graduates will qualify in 2004 and 2005. The projections for post-graduates in 2004 and 2005 will be finalised after further discussions with the colleges of education.</P>
      <P>In addition to increasing the output of graduates the Government has introduced other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel. Bachelor of Education graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified to teach at primary level here.</P>
      <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers and since September 2000 teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers.</P>
      <P>Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000, teachers trained outside the EU whose qualifications are accepted by my Department will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
      <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without <Col N="1431" /> the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. The increase in the number of graduates and the other measures I have implemented as outlined will help greatly to meet the current teacher needs.</P>
    <P>The Government since taking office has retained the demographic dividend arising at primary level each year and has also created an unprecedented number of new teaching posts. Some 1,800 new teaching posts have been created which has enabled the Government to reduce the pupil teacher ratio from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 19.0:1 in the current school year, and the actual pupil teacher ratio nationally to 14.1:1.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, an additional 350 primary teaching posts will be allocated for the 2002-2003 school year and 200 for the 2003-2004 school year. The granting of these additional posts will further reduce the PTR in primary schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: (a) the higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; and (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that she-he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she-he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
      <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the mainten<Col N="1433" /> ance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the Student Assistance-Access Fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million &ndash; £1.964 million in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million &ndash; £5.9 million &ndash; in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The Government has agreed to a set of proposals which provides for the making of a contribution of &euro;128 million by religious congregations to the scheme of compensation for people who suffered abuse while in institutional care. The terms of the agreement include: a cash payment of &euro;38 million, of which &euro;12.7 million will be placed in an education trust for former residents of the institutions and their families; property transfers totalling &euro;80 million &ndash; this amount will include property transfers which have been, or are being, made since the Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, made an apology in May 1999 to victims of institutional child abuse, with further transfers up to the total amount taking place within the next three to five years; &euro;10 million in counselling, record retrieval and pastoral services for people in need; and the religious congregations have stated that they will also continue their co-operation with State and voluntary bodies in relation to property transfers for services to people in need.</P>
      <P>The agreement with the congregations is at present an outline agreement in principle. Officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General will, in the immediate future, engage in further discussion with representatives of the congregations concerned to finalise all issues. These include details of all property transferred or to be transferred and the valuation of that property. In agreeing on valuation, the services of the State's valuers, the Valuation Office, will be called on and allowance will be made for any investment the State has made which enhances the value of the property concerned. As to the legal basis for transfers these will be concluded with the assistance of the Chief State Solicitor's Office and will ensure that full title for all properties is transferred to the State.</P>

      <P>The introduction of foundation level English at leaving certificate level is a matter which has been given detailed consideration by the NCCA &ndash; National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &ndash; course committee for leaving certificate English. While some arguments that can be advanced in favour of this development, the course committee decided against the introduction of a foundation level in leaving certificate English.</P>
      <P>The committee, in fact, designed the course at two levels &ndash; higher and ordinary &ndash; and specifically ensured that the ordinary level would cater for students who had taken both the junior certificate ordinary and foundation levels. The percentage of students who achieved less than a D grade in ordinary level English has, in fact, fallen in 2001 to 4.5%. I should also point out to the Deputy that the leaving certificate applied includes an examination in English and communication. English, like all other areas of the curriculum, will be subject to review by the NCCA in due course. This review can include a re-examination of the case for foundation level English.</P>

      <P>The pupil concerned resides 0.5 miles from the nearest pick up point on an existing service. The school bus servicing the route does not pass her home either in the morning or afternoon. This is considered to be a reasonable level of service in the general context of the scheme. As extra State cost would be incurred by extending the service and a number of other pupils would be inconvenienced the present arrangement is the most that may be offered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force on dyslexia has completed its work and presented its report to my Department in November 2001. The report of the task force, which deals with a wide range of complex issues, is now being considered in my Department. Copies of the report can be accessed on my Department's website and arrangements are being made to make printed copies of the report available in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educational needs of pupils with dyslexia of primary school age are generally capable of being met within the mainstream school sector with the support, where necessary, of the remedial teacher service or the resource teacher <Col N="1438" /> service. There are currently 1,485 remedial teachers and more than 1,500 full-time equivalent resource teacher posts in primary schools. For some children, the severity of the condition can be such as to require placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. At present, there are four special schools and 20 special classes dedicated to children with dyslexia.</P>
    <P>At second level, pupils with dyslexia are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the severity of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations. In December 2000, I announced a highly innovative nationwide pilot scheme to assist second level students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. Thirty-one schools around the country are participating in the pilot project costing £2 million. Each student with dyslexia is provided with a laptop computer and specially designed software for school and home use.</P>
    <P>In addition to funding in-school support services, my Department supports the work of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland in providing classes for children with dyslexia outside of school hours. An annual funding allocation of &euro;63,486.90 &ndash; £50,000 &ndash; is made to the association to support this work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: (a) the higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue <Col N="1439" /> from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that she-he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases. Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million &ndash; £1.964 million &ndash; in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million &ndash; £5.9 million &ndash; in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>The family in question reside 0.9 miles from the route of service to the school. The road from the family's home to the pick-up point is considered to be no less safe than similar roads used by children throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that as far as possible no eligible pupil will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of service are generally expected to make their own way, or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>
      <P>As the family concerned are considered to have an adequate level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme, it is not open to my Department to allow a re-routing of service at additional cost, as requested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 436, 437 and 440 together.</P>
      <P>Currently my Department provides annual grants towards the cost of staffing and equipment in respect of nine recognised VEC outdoor education centres. An expansion in the number of grant-aided VEC outdoor education centres to include three operational outdoor education centres, which are not currently in receipt of funding, is under consideration in my Department. Tanagh outdoor centre is one of the centres being considered at present.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between officials of my Department and various representatives of the staff of the recognised outdoor education centres regarding their status, salary, terms and conditions of employment are at a crucial stage. The Deputies will appreciate that the regularisation of the staffing position within the centres will represent a major improvement in the operation of those centres. Such a development, while undoubtedly welcome, will have significant cost implications for the centres and any new arrangements agreed will impact on the future budgetary planning and funding strategy for VEC outdoor education centres. It is in this context that the question of recognising other centres will be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year County Monaghan VEC requested my Department to provide capital funding towards the purchase of land on which it was proposed to develop new premises for Tanagh outdoor education centre. Under the sports capital programme my Department had provided capital funding towards the development of some recog<Col N="1446" /> nised outdoor education centres. The sports capital programme, however, was relocated to the Department of Tourism, Sports and Recreation in 1997.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates this Government's <Col N="1448" /> commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997. Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity. A building project at St. Patrick's National School, Greystones, Co. Wicklow is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993, my Department issued guidelines on countering bullying behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was <Col N="1449" /> to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline, which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
      <P>Under health and safety legislation, school management authorities are responsible for providing a safe environment for all personnel present in the school including pupils. In a circular relating to guidelines on violence in schools, issued by my Department in 1999, schools were advised of their duties in this area and of the need to take positive measures to prevent and minimise the risk of violence within the school environment. In particular, the attention of schools was drawn to the need for effective school policies on school discipline and bullying. The circular advises schools that these policies should be reviewed on a regular basis and suggests that the early identification and resolution of weaknesses in school policies generally lessens the threat of violence in the school.</P>
      <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department, and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools. While management is not required to notify my Department of bullying cases in schools, my Department regularly receives telephone calls reporting alleged instances of bullying. These calls, generally, are informal inquiries and advice and my Department's staff offers assistance to the callers. In addition, my Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. The new national educational psychological service is available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

      <P>No final decisions have yet been taken regarding the precise areas to which the funding in question will be deployed within the special education sector. Under present arrangements <Col N="1450" /> my Department provides funding to meet the special equipment needs, including computer needs, of students with disabilities in schools. The funding is allocated to school authorities to purchase the relevant equipment for use by the pupils concerned. Grants for the purchase of special equipment are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual pupils concerned. A sum of £1.9 million was allocated at primary level in the last year to support the purchase of specialised equipment, including computer packages. In addition, schools with special classes receive a special needs grant of &euro;95.23 per pupil in respect of all pupils in special classes for ICT requirements in these classes. This is additional to a basic grant of &euro;1,904.61 plus &euro;19 per pupil for ICT requirements paid to all primary schools.</P>
      <P>Special schools receive a basic grant of &euro;1,904.61 plus &euro;19 per pupil for the ICT requirements of the school. In addition, special schools receive a special needs grant of &euro;95.23 per pupil for the ICT requirements of the school. Resource teachers and learning support teachers in primary schools receive a grant of &euro;634.87 to meet the ICT requirements of pupils catered for by these teachers. Second level schools receive a basic grant of &euro;1,904.61 plus &euro;19 per pupil for the ICT requirements of the school. Resource teachers and learning support teachers at second level receive a grant of &euro;952.30 per allocated whole-time equivalent post paid proportionate to the whole time equivalent allocation per school. Provision in this area is kept under ongoing review to ensure that the specialised equipment needs of students with disabilities are met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority, in respect of the provision of health related support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. However many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health <Col N="1451" /> boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. My Department is also undertaking a number of short, medium and longer term measures to increase the availability of trained staff in these areas.</P>
      <P>I understand from the South-Western Area Health Board, which provides services for children with autism on behalf of the authority, that where speech and language therapy services cannot be provided directly by the board, arrangements are in place to provide a grant to the schools in which the special classes for children with autism are located to assist in enabling the children to access these services.</P>
      <P>My Department has asked the regional chief executive of the authority to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 460 to 464, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22. The action group recom<Col N="1456" /> mended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she-he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one grant scheme in respect of post-leaving certificate courses: (a) the higher education grants scheme; (b) the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; (c) the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and (d) the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate &ndash; PLC &ndash; courses. All four schemes have similar provisions, relating, for example, to residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, she-he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the students, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that she-he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she-he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his-her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation. Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students in approved third level institutions through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to <Col N="1457" /> disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million, £1.964 million, in respect of the 2000-01 academic year to &euro;7.49 million, £5.9 million, in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>Sa bhliain 1999, chuaigh Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh chun cainte leis na hollscoileanna eile a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta ina n-abhantrach ar mhaithe le moltaí a dhéanamh maidir le forbairt an oideachais tríú leibhéal sa Ghaeltacht. Ina dhiaidh sin, bunaíodh grúpa oibre idir-ollscoile, idir Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, Ollscoil na hÉireann Corcaigh, Ollscoil na hÉireann, Má Nuad agus Ollscoil na Ríona, Béal Feirste, le tuairimí na nollscoileanna a fháil agus stráitéis chomtháite forbartha a aontú. Chuir an grúpa plean forbatha don oideachas triú leibhéal sa Ghaeltacht faoi mo bhráid agus faoi bhráid an Aire Stáit sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán.</P>
      <P>De bharr tábhacht an ábhair is léir go mba chóir impleachtaí na stráitéise a mheas sula ndéanfar cinneadh ina leith. Dá bharr sin tá sé ar intinn agam grúpa oibre idir gníomhachta a bhunú, le hionadaithe ó mo Roinn féin, an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas agus Údarás na Gaeltachta, le bheith i bhfeighil na hoibre.</P>

      <P>Since the Government came into office, there has been a great increase in the level of activity in the area of primary school building. This has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of major building projects in construction, which has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>

      <P>The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the accommodation situation in primary schools. This is almost four times the previous Government's investment in 1997.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since this Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
      <P>Knockea national school is being extended-refurbished as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. The project will continue to the invitation of tenders, as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.</P>
