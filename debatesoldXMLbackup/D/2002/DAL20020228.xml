      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Joe Higgins and I now call on him to state the matter.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I seek the suspension of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance: the statement yesterday by the masters of three maternity hospitals that termination of pregnancy should be provided for in this State in certain cases of foetal inviability which, however, would be expressly forbidden if the Government's proposal is carried on 6 March; the fact that this is one more of many contradictions that have arisen in the debate; the need to modify the Government's proposal or have it withdrawn <Col N="2" /> altogether; and the need to continue the debate in a way beneficial to women's well-being in the State.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 49<i>a</i>, Revised Estimates for Public Services, 2002 [Vote 44], back from Committee; No. 25, motion re presentation and circulation of Revised Estimates 2002; No. <i>a</i>25<i>a</i>, motion re referral to Select Committee of Espoo Convention; European Charter of Local Self-Government; and Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change; No. 50, Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, 1998 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 1, Competition Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad</i>] &ndash; Second Stage; No. 25<i>a</i>, motion re Code of Conduct, to be taken not later than 2.30 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 49<i>a</i>, 25, and <i>a</i>25<i>a</i>, shall be decided without debate and any division demanded on Nos. 49<i>a</i> and 25 shall be taken forthwith; (2) the Report and Final Stages of No. 50 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in respect of amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Public Enterprise; (3) the proceedings on No. 25<i>a</i> shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the speech of the Chairman of the Committee on Members' Interests, and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon should not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (4) the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 March 2002.</P>

      <P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. The first is the proposal for dealing with No. 49a, 25 and <i>a</i>25<i>a</i> without debate. Is that agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not agreed. No. <i>a</i>25<i>a</i> is particularly timely given the amount of flooding of farmland and sandbagging of residential areas that is taking place as we speak. Would it be possible to amend this to take into account the particular interest of my party in having a role in this debate, given that it is not mentioned in the Order of Business as read out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir. We are being asked in what is, effectively, an election campaign period to agree that the House should adjourn, effectively, for two weeks in which period the Order of Business and leaders' questions would be taken on one occasion. We are being asked to collude in the abandonment of an accountable democratic system. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste will not come into the House today. The Tánaiste will be in Buswell's Hotel in a few minutes launching the report of the company law review committee, a matter so important that she cannot come into the House. The Taoiseach is in Roscommon. We are being asked to give our assent to the denigration of the role of the Opposition and are not agreeing to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at how Parliament has become a sham, and this proposal reinforces that impression. It is important that the Government realises this and brings forward the date of the general election before further discredit falls upon Parliament which is being sidelined. The Government appears to be more interested in canvassing in a long election campaign than doing the work of Parliament.</P>

I do not know how good the Opposition is on figures and statistics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the dying days of the Government. The Government has been five years in office and the Minister for Education and Science has had a distinguished career in many ministries. It is a great pity he has presided for a number of years over absolute chaos in the secondary school sector. It is a great pity that so many students this morning, particularly leaving certificate students, do not know whether their schools will be open next Monday. The Minister has been at war with the ASTI for almost three years. It is clear this morning that the TUI will support the ASTI in its action and there is no confidence that the Minister's emergency plan will work.</P>
      <P>Has he any appreciation at all of the trauma in families where leaving certificate students will be deprived of classes in the final few months before they do their leaving certificate examinations? Has he any appreciation of the stress of parents and students who are faced with this situation? Can he give students any hope that he will take action today to ensure full classes are available in every second level school on Monday and right through until the examinations are held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand why the Minister for Education and Science is so embarrassed by the debacle that is the reality in the education system and I support what has been said by Deputy Noonan with regard to the fear, concern and anxiety that many parents and sixth form students, who are studying for their leaving certificate, feel as we speak. Why is it that it is only sometime later today that the Minister will meet the three teachers' unions? Why has he not agreed to meet them sooner? Does he agree with the statement issued by the secretary general of the TUI earlier that a resolution of this dispute is available, which will require a great deal of negotiation and dialogue, and that at the end of the day some recognition of the role of teachers in the totality of the education system must be properly recognised? Why has the Minister left it until the eleventh hour? What assurances can he give us that the dispute can be resolved? What will he say to the teachers' unions later? What comfort, if any, can he give to the House and to all the parents, teachers and pupils who are dependent <Col N="7" /><Col N="8" /> on him to bring about a successful resolution of this conflict?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the party leaders opposite, I am concerned principally about the welfare of the students and their position in terms of the disruption that is threatened. Leading up to the leaving certificate examinations last year, there was also a threat of disruption and my Department had made contingency plans well in advance. They were well discussed and prepared by the people involved and they were quite successful. In the current dispute, the ASTI has said it plans to withdraw teachers from substitution and supervision work and, in that event, it does not wish to disrupt or disturb the work of students or prevent others from doing the supervision and substitution work. The ASTI has declared that position repeatedly and openly and I believe that is its determined position.</P>
      <P>In light of events, I have met parents' groups and unions and we have been in dialogue with the unions continuously, as the Deputies will appreciate. We are meeting the unions later this morning in an effort to bring about a situation in which it will be possible to suspend the dispute or adhere strictly to the rules that the ASTI has laid down for its members.</P>
      <P>There is a particular difficulty in some schools where both the TUI and the ASTI are involved. That creates special difficulties for the TUI, which is anxious not to disrupt students. That union is still working on benchmarking within the PPF and is co-operating with the ICTU and it does not want to be drawn into the dispute but it is faced with a difficulty. We will certainly give the TUI and the schools involved every support and I trust that the ASTI will also recognise the difficulties in such situations in the spirit in which it is approaching this action.</P>
      <P>I am just two years in the Department, not three.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute had gone some distance before I took up office and, unfortunately, the ASTI had decided not to participate in the PPF and to withdraw from the ICTU. That has created special difficulties for everyone in the negotiations because we are approaching June when the outcome of benchmarking will be made available. The PPF has provided a 22% increase <Col N="9" /> in wages and on top of that I am quite confident there will be some improvement for teachers under benchmarking. I do not know what that will be but their position is being considered under the benchmarking process, which applies to the entire public service.</P>
      <P>I appeal to everybody involved to give the process an opportunity to work. We have provided alternatives to the ASTI through the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court and, as the Deputies will be aware, the Labour Court made a very fair, reasonable, supportive and helpful recommendation which, unfortunately, was rejected. We will continue in a spirit of conciliation to attempt to find a resolution to the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minster will be aware that appropriate supervision in schools is a condition of insurance and if appropriate supervision is not put in place a school's management has no choice but to close the school, otherwise it would be exposed to huge liabilities. Will the Minister outline his contingency plan to ensure appropriate supervision is put in place? What budget has he assigned to this task? Who has final responsibility for ensuring appropriate supervision in schools and the safety of children if the teachers refuse to do their traditional supervising roles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been in contact with the insurers and there is no difficulty with insurance. We know exactly where we stand and that is part of the contingency plan. There will be no problem in relation to insurance cover. In relation to supervision and substitution, as the Deputies know, the joint managerial board was initially concerned that 2,000 people would have to be found. Since each school is managed by a board of management, within the community locally, parents and those who support a school there will be people willing to help overcome these difficulties especially given that the ASTI has said it is not prepared to interfere or intervene in that. Some 5,000 people have come forward to give their assistance in that regard and there is no problem in relation to budgets.</P>

      <P>I would have loved to be able to ask the Tánaiste why the Progressive Democrats have acquiesced in the referendum debate. If she <Col N="10" /> had been here this morning, I would have been particularly anxious to ask her why the Progressive Democrats have abandoned their responsibility on this and why they have gone silent bearing in mind the exhortations they gave so eloquently back in 1992. I understand the Tánaiste is away on important business across the street in Buswells Hotel, launching a document that has to be launched between 10.30 and 11.30 today &ndash; the report of the company law review group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is leaders' questions addressed to leaders and unfortunately the leader to whom I want to speak is hiding in Buswells Hotel. I do not know if she can hear us over there. Since I have to exercise my right to ask questions, can I ask the Minister for Education and Science when he will honour the commitment given on 4 December at a committee and subsequently reiterated on 12 December in parliamentary questions that he will publish in full the list of the 850 schools that are at various stages awaiting an indication from the building unit in Tullamore as to the precise stage at which the building programme for each of their schools stands? He has been repeatedly asked this question. If their school is among the 850, I suspect the students in the Gallery would like to know whether that project is at stage one, two or three. Why does the Minister for Education and Science refuse to honour a commitment to publish the list in full and let everybody know where they are on it? What does he have to hide? Has the Minister for Finance taken all the money that the Minister for Education and Science says he has to the extent that nobody in Tullamore can give any indication about these projects?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair to assume that schools on this list are at different stages of planning and development? Last week in reply to several questions tabled by Deputies from all parts of the country, the same platitudinous anodyne reply was given to everybody as if all schools were at exactly the same stage of progress. What is the position? Does the Minister have a capital budget that he will spend this year? Is he saving the announcement until the election campaign proper commences? When can we expect a full statement from the Minister as to where different schools lie on the list of 850 that have construction and development programmes submitted to his Department?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 6, after &ldquo;1995&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE MAKING OF GRANTS OUT OF FUNDS PROVIDED BY THE OIREACHTAS FOR REMEDIATION WORKS FOR HOUSES HAVING CERTAIN LEVELS OF RADON GAS AND FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BY THE RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION INSTITUTE OF IRELAND OF SUCH GRANTS&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is required so that the Long Title reflects the revised content of the Bill to include a scheme for the provision of grants for remediation works for houses having certain levels of radon gas and for the administration of these grants by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is a standard provision in all legislation and defines a number of terms used in the Bill in relation to the proposed grant scheme.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 inserts a new section 5 in the Bill and provides the framework for the establishment of a grant scheme for certain remediation works to houses that are used as residences. Under section 5, the Minister is authorised to allocate money to the RPII to administer a grant scheme for the carrying out of remediation works to a residence in respect of which measurements of radon gas taken inside that residence exceed 200 becquerels per cubic metre and to allocate money to the RPII to cover the costs of administering this scheme. The level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre is the national reference standard above which remedial action to reduce the indoor radon level in a dwelling should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Commission for Radiological Protection published a report entitled Protection against Radon 222 at Home and at Work. That report recommended intervention where radon gas levels in dwellings were within a certain range. Our national reference standard of 200 becquerels per cubic metre corresponds to the <Col N="23" /> lower end of the international commission's recommended range. A reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre for radon in dwellings has been adopted by most European countries. In section 5, provision is also made to authorise the institute to appoint inspectors to inspect remediation works where a person has applied for a grant. The RPII is authorised to establish administrative structures to administer this grant scheme. Provision is also made for the institute to provide information to the Minister when requested and maintain records for a period to be prescribed by regulations. Records must contain details of levels of radon gas for each application and all moneys paid to applicants.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I have a number of matters for the Minister of State to clarify. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is essentially a regulatory and supervisory body. Section 7(5) states that &ldquo;The Institute shall establish a system for the inspection of any house and remediation works that are subject to an application under this Act.&rdquo; Has the Minister of State received an assurance that the RPII actually has qualified staff to enable this process to be carried out? It is my impression that the RPII has not the necessary personnel to implement this within its staff. In addition to its other regulatory and supervisory functions, the RPII is now promoting, courtesy of freepost, remediation radon measurements to all householders who have elevated radon levels in their homes in an attempt, which I welcome, to encourage remediation of homes. However, there is no such thing as free measurement as central Government, through the Department of Public Enterprise and, ultimately, the taxpayer, will carry the cost of these measurements.</P>
      <P>The promotion of free radon measurements among householders by a non-commercial semi-State organisation will, undoubtedly, present a serious threat to the viability of commercial radon measurement service providers currently operating in Ireland. With some conviction, I suggest this may be an anti-competitive practice. Will the Minister of State say whether the RPII or his Department is funding the current programme of free radon measurements? Will the Department, under this Bill, provide additional financial resources to the RPII to fund more extensive free radon measurement programmes? Will the Minister of State see to it that, as part of the new legislation, commercial radon measurement service providers, who are doing an excellent job, will also be permitted to offer such free radon measurement services to householders and to claim back the commercial cost from the RPII or the Department of Public Enterprise? There should be a level playing field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RPII has consistently stated that remedial work associated with indoor radon is not within its technical competence or its remit as the radiological protection agency. That being so, how <Col N="24" /> does the RPII intend to carry out its site inspection functions as part of its grant awarding role? </P>

      <P>That is correct, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The points raised by Deputy Higgins have been the subject of long discussion with the RPII and I am sure the Deputy shared my desire to have the grant scheme in place before now. However, I am grateful to the Minister for Finance for providing the funding so that we are now in a position to proceed with the scheme. Throughout the period of preparation for this development, these matters have been discussed with the RPII which has long been identified as the authority and the expert scientific body in this country in relation to radiological protection matters. I submit there is no more appropriate body than the RPII to administer this important scheme. Inspectors will be appointed by the RPII which is being given additional financial resources to administer the scheme. I understand the RPII makes a reasonable charge for measuring radon levels. It is not an exorbitant charge, by any means, and I have not received any complaints in that regard. Operational aspects of the scheme will be set out in the regulations which I intend will follow very expeditiously after the Bill is enacted.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;(1) An inspection of any house or remediation works under this Act shall not concern any building or other works carried out by the contractor, the applicant or any other person to a house where such works were required for the installation of the remediation works concerned in that house and an inspection or a report of a remediation works inspector under this Act shall not be construed as an inspection or approval of such building or other works.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 8 and the substitute amendment No. 12 insert new sections 6 and 10 respectively in the Bill. Section 6 is concerned with the nature of inspections to be carried out and is limited to houses and remediation works that are the subject of an application under the scheme. In section 6(2), provision is made to disclaim liability by the State or the RPII for any damages that an applicant may allege have been caused as a result of any other works undertaken for the purposes of carrying out these remediation works. The incorporation of this immunity provision as well as that contained in section 10 is on the express advice of the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Section 10 addresses the immunity of the Minister and the RPII from prosecution in cases for the recovery of damages. The reason for this substitute amendment is to confirm that the immunity for malfeasance provided for in section 10(1) only applies in relation to the grant scheme. The types of action that are contemplated in the section are damages claimed by an applicant in relation to any injury to person or property alleged to have been caused by a failure to carry out any function conferred or imposed under this Act or alleged to have been caused by a contractor carrying out remediation works. This latter immunity underlines the nature of the inspection process and the fact that neither the Minister nor the RPII are parties to any arrangements the applicant may enter into with a contractor. I emphasise that these provisions do not in any way deprive the applicant of remedies that they may wish to proceed with in the normal way.</P>

The carrying out of works will be done by ordinary persons and contractors. After the completion of work, it is not envisaged that every premises will be inspected because it is not practical to ensure all the work is being comprehensively done. However, there will be an acceptable level of spot checks to ensure that is the case. This is a comparatively small job and we have to be practical about it.

    <P>&ldquo;7.&ndash;(1) Where an applicant has complied with this Act and any regulations made under <i>section 8</i> and the remediation works concerned have been carried out in accordance with this Act and regulations made under <i>section 8</i> and have been completed, the Institute shall pay the grant concerned to the applicant.</P>
    <P>(2) The amount of a grant to be paid to an applicant by the Institute shall be one half of the costs incurred by the applicant for the remediation works but subject to a maximum amount of &euro;1,000, whichever sum is the lesser amount.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 inserts a new section 7 in the Bill to deal with the payment of the grant. The section limits the maximum level of grant that may be paid to &euro;1,000. The grant is payable only on completion of the remedial works in compliance with the provisions of the Act and regulations made under section 8, which set out certain eligibility requirements for the applicant and house. I propose to set the grant, in effect, at 50% of the cost of remediation works up to a maximum cost of &euro;1,000. I am advised that estimates for the cost of radon remediation measures vary from about &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,000 and a grant of 50% is, in those circumstances, very reasonable given the estimates with which we have been provided.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 inserts a new section 8 empowering the Minister to make regulations for the administration of the scheme by the RPII and details of the operation of the scheme. It contains a non-exhaustive list of the types of matters that may be covered in the regulations, such as the duration of the scheme, requirements for applicants, requirements for the class or classes of house that may be eligible, provisions concerning remediation works inspections, requirements for contractors and dispute resolution procedures. Provision is also made requiring the Minister to lay such regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>This grant scheme has been a long time coming. I am extremely disappointed at the level of grant on offer, which prompted me to put down an amendment that was ruled out of order on the basis that it would constitute a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State quoted from the information supplied to him that the cost is somewhere in the region of &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,000. Yesterday I contacted three different private commercial operators who have been providing this service over a considerable period of time and based on their experience they suggested a cost in the region of &euro;3,100 to &euro;3,800 for houses above the 200 becquerel level. There was a con<Col N="30" /> sensus on the cost involved being of that magnitude.</P>
    <P>By pitching the grant level as rigidly as has been done, a 50% grant up to &euro;1,000 means that in most cases there will be a top-up of some &euro;2,100 to &euro;2,800 required. That money will have to come from the household in question. I earnestly submit to the Minister of State that it will put the grant scheme out of the reach of most low income and some middle income families. We are dealing with a very short-term scheme here. All new houses must comply with the radon remediation scheme, so it does not apply to new houses, and it is further limited to counties where there is a high concentration of radon; Sligo, Mayo, Donegal, Clare and a corner down in the south-east. There is a very clearly defined geographical area and probably a clearly defined number of houses.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House, how many houses we are potentially dealing with, based on the research that has been carried out to date? This scheme will probably peter out in three to four years because all houses concerned should be treated by then. This is a public health issue, which arises by virtue of an accident of geographical location where certain houses are in an area of high radon concentration and there is an obligation on the State to meet a substantially more generous percentage of the cost than advocated in the grant measure as it stands. We need a grant level that will be more realistic in meeting the current costs. I welcome the scheme but from the point of view of meeting the requirements of low income families it will be of little value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Higgins' argument in favour of increasing the grant level. There is a relatively small number of houses that are being targeted for radon remediation and due to the public health aspect it would be a disaster if those people for whom the grant would be appropriate would be excluded or would exclude themselves because they could not afford the top-up on the grant. The recommendation of a maximum of &euro;1,000 is very low and there will be different levels in terms of the different types of houses, the age of the house, standard of building and so on. I urge the Minister to review that recommendation in terms of the total amount stipulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to give a 100% grant and be as generous as possible, particularly to those most in need. I am satisfied there will not be people unable to afford this. I would not like to see any belittling of this scheme or the grant levels emanating from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RPII and other experts, including Deputy Upton, when she was chairperson of the RPII, advocated to me the importance of introducing this grant with a view to encouraging people to take steps to have remediation measures carried out in their homes. The decision to set a maximum grant level of &euro;1,000 is reasonable and <Col N="31" /> fair. Estimates for the cost of radon remediation measures vary from &euro;1,000 to &euro;2,030. That is not to denigrate the information given by Deputy Higgins, but these are the indications we have received through our research.</P>
    <P>In recent years a considerable body of experience has been built up on effective and relatively inexpensive remedial measures to reduce indoor radon gas concentrations. These measures work, either by preventing the entry of radon into a building from the soil, or by removing it after it has entered by means of improved indoor ventilation. The most appropriate solution in a particular building will depend both on the radon gas concentration and on the nature of the building. Through the implementation of the appropriate mitigation solution it is possible in the vast majority of buildings to reduce the concentration well below the reference level.</P>
    <P>Colleagues will be aware that since the building regulations, which came into operation in July 1997, all new houses must have a built-in sump and in areas where there is a high radon concentration a radon-proof membrane must be incorporated into the foundation of the house, thus it is remediation work to older housing stock that is being targeted by this scheme, although only houses that are in the areas that have been established by the nationwide survey work of the RPII will be affected.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Higgins' question, between 1992 and 1999 the RPII carried out a national radon survey as a result of which it concluded that approximately 91,000 houses have indoor radon levels exceeding the national standard of 200 becquerels per cubic metre. Of these, some 60,000 of the houses located in high radon areas will require the installation of remediation measures, such as radon sumps. The remediation works required will depend on the radon gas concentration and on the nature of the building. I want to put a fair scheme in place which will encourage people to take appropriate measures. I want an effective grant scheme, not one with administrative costs equal to, if not greater than, the cost of the grants being paid out. We have all seen such schemes over the years. The degree of red tape is directly linked to the level of the grant and measures required to monitor payments.</P>
    <P>Given the variation in the measures that may be required, a grant of 50% is even-handed. Fixing the maximum limit at &euro;1,000 is fair in view of the estimated costs. It is also prudent as it will not provide an incentive to those members of the community who are less scrupulous than they should be in their dealings with older or more vulnerable persons living in areas with high radon levels who, quite naturally, will be anxious to have their homes made safe.</P>

        <b>: </b>Persons totally dependent on a contributory or non-contributory old age pensions of &euro;140 for their incomes who live in <Col N="32" /> dwellings where radon levels are above the safety threshold will not be able to bridge the gap between the grant level and the cost of the remediation work. The figures I have been given have come from reputable companies who did not anticipate the scheme and who are carrying out work as cost effectively as they can. There is a huge differential there which will automatically exclude many from participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is going about this the wrong way by enshrining the grant amount in the legislation which means that the grant is fixed and cannot be varied. For example, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government can vary the amount of the new house grant without any reference to this House and local authorities can increase essential repair grants with his approval. By enshrining the maximum grant level in the legislation in this case, the Minister of State is precluding the possibility of further variation and I wager that when we assess this in six or nine months' time, the uptake will not be nearly so large as he anticipates.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that 60,000 houses would be eligible for the grant, though all of them might not require expensive remediation works. Even if all of them were to receive the grant at the maximum level, the total cost would be &euro;60 million over four to five years. They will undoubtedly all qualify because they will not get the works done any more cheaply and the 50% level will not be relevant. The Minister of State should have used amendment No. 10 which provides for the Minister to make regulations concerning the grant scheme. He could have included a sub-section allowing the Minister to vary the level of the grant in accordance with current commercial costs. I am not being negative. The Minister of State said that he does not want anybody belittling the scheme.</P>

      <P>I have done my sums, as has Deputy Jim Higgins, and &euro;60 million to prevent the lung cancer with which radon gas is particularly associated is a very small investment. The maximum grant of &euro;1,000 is not going to be taken up by people. It is not going to make a huge difference to those that can afford it and it will not make it possible for those who cannot to bridge the gap between the grant and the cost of remediation. Those most in need are going to be excluded. Setting the level of the grant in stone is counterproductive and does not allow scope for variation if things should change or if the grant is not taken up over the next couple of months. What will happen if the cost of remediation works becomes significantly greater? There will be a bigger shortfall for those in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to introduce a grant for the elimination of radon gas from private dwellings. Is the grant available to deal with problems in national and secondary schools, particularly the former? The Minister of State will be aware that there has been much concern about the levels of radon gas in some national schools. In my constituency there is a particular problem in an area where the radon levels are very high anyway, much higher than the national average. While a householder can apply for funding, is a similar arrangement being made for boards of management or principals of national schools in areas where high radon gas levels have been identified? This must be dealt with as a matter of urgency. Does the Minister of State have any information regarding the work that has been done to date to deal with this matter? There was much concern a few years ago at which point some remedial action was taken, but there are still concerns. Will funding be provided to schools under this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing perfect in this world and we never achieve the ideal. I have long paid tribute to the previous Administration, particularly to Deputy Stagg, for bringing forward radiological protection legislation which introduced the idea of this grant although the money was not forthcoming at that stage. I do not say that as a charge because having pushed for funding for a number of years, I know how difficult it has been to introduce this measure. The money is available now and we are able to proceed.</P>
      <P>What we have provided here is most meritorious and, although I concede that it could be better, it is the best available. We should take a positive view of what has been done to deal with what is a one-off issue. The grant will be availed of and houses and other living accommodation in areas with high radon levels will be attended to. The problem is not one that recurs because new houses are provided with the protection when they are built. We really should be taking a much more positive view of the situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Daly's question, I am glad to say the Radiological Protection Institute has carried out a survey of the entire country. I think I am correct in saying the survey of all schools has been completed. I will double check that for him but if it has not been completed, it is well nigh completed nationally, in both primary and secondary level schools. A programme of remediation measures is well advanced. Again I will see that the Deputy and, indeed, the other colleagues present in the House get details of the updated position in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a matter which this Government took in hand at an early stage and I am very grateful to the Minister for Education and Science for footing the bill for the cost <i>in toto</i> of those <Col N="34" /> measures, that is, the surveys which were carried out and the remediation measures. Therefore, the Deputy can rest assured that the important area of schools, which are after all where our children spend a great percentage of their time anyway, has been dealt with comprehensively.</P>

      <P>On the point about the costing, despite a tremendous effort on behalf of the RPII to raise the level of awareness about radon gas and the hazards associated with radon gas, there is still a great lack of awareness by many individuals about the real implications of radon. Because people cannot see this gas or smell it and, as far as they are concerned, it is not having any impact on their lifestyle, health or safety, I have a great concern that if there is a grant which is not substantial and does not go a long way towards the remediation, they will actually ignore it, stand back, let it go and not do anything about it. I would be afraid that it is the most vulnerable and those most in need who are most likely to do that.</P>
      <P>As we have already stated, there are significant public health implications with radon but this is hidden because they cannot identify the danger &ndash; they cannot see or smell the danger and it is not like a damp wall or electrical wiring in a house where one can observe a risk and see the danger. As a result, they are likely to ignore it, walk away from it and say, &ldquo;I cannot afford it. Let us let it go.&rdquo;</P>

        <b>: </b>I subscribe to everything Deputy Upton has said. Radon is a relatively newly discovered phenomenon. It was always there but its discovery and identification in various parts of the country is new. As Deputy Upton stated so eloquently, it is a known lung cancer causing agent.</P>
      <P>What is envisaged by the RPII in terms of making the public aware that there is a scheme, of what exactly radon gas is, and of the ill effects of radon gas on an individual's health or on the occupants of a house where the safety level is breached? Is it proposed to carry out an assessment after six or nine months on how exactly the scheme is operating, whether it is effective, and whether the uptake is as substantial as the Minister seems to think it will be with a view to going back and reviewing the scheme?</P>
      <P>I subscribe to everything that has been said regarding the manner in which this scheme is unlikely to be taken up because of the total inadequacy of the grant. The figures I have given are genuine and from reputable contractors who know the business, who have a track record, who are not in it to rip anybody off and who price very competitively indeed.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to reform and modernise our current legislation relating to competition and mergers. The Bill retains what is best of the existing arrangements and introduces new features, in particular, a more focused approach towards the penalisation of anti-competitive activities, more sensible arrangements for how we handle mergers and acquisitions, and a strengthened Competition Authority capable of making a real impact in its core task of enforcing competition law.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the culmination of a process of consideration extending over a five year period. That work commenced during the term of the previous Government with the establishment in 1996 of the competition and mergers review group. The final report of that group, published in May 2000, forms the main background to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a time of modernisation also for the competition law of the European Union. Articles 81 and 82, formerly Articles 85 and 86, of the EU treaty set out the basic EU competition rules applying to undertakings. The practical appli<Col N="39" /> cation and enforcement by the European Commission of these rules are mainly provided for in Regulation 17 of 1962. In September 2000 the Commission proposed a draft Council regulation to replace Regulation 17. This proposal, which is under consideration in a Council working group, involves the complete recasting of the existing arrangements for the implementation of Community competition law.</P>
    <P>Two proposed EU changes are of specific relevance to the Bill. First, it is proposed to abolish the EU notification system and make the whole of Article 81 directly applicable. Second, the Commission proposes that the competent authorities in member states, in our case the courts and the Competition Authority, shall be empowered to apply Articles 81 and 82 using national procedures and remedies. While the draft regulation is still under discussion in Brussels, these two specific changes are likely to be included in the final version and appropriate account has been taken of them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will outline the principal features of the Bill, drawing attention to the main policy innovations which it contains. The Bill will repeal and replace the three main statutes which deal with merger control and competition generally in the State. These are the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, the Competition Act, 1991, and the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Part 2 makes provision for the rules and procedures which will govern the prohibition of activities which prevent, restrict or distort competition in trade in the State or which constitute an abuse of a dominant position in such trade. The 1991 Act, which first introduced these prohibitions and rules, relied for enforcement mainly on private civil actions and a system of voluntary notification of agreements to the Competition Authority. By 1996, it was considered that this approach was not achieving the desired results, and the Competition (Amendment) Act of that year introduced two important enforcement changes. First, infringements of the competition rules were made criminal offences in addition to being civil wrongs and, second, the Competition Authority was empowered to initiate or recommend civil or criminal proceedings in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>In general terms, it can be said the current system of competition rules and enforcement is working well. While the availability of private civil remedies for breaches of the competition rules may not have had the widespread impact envisaged in 1991, they have nevertheless produced a useful, if small, body of Irish jurisprudence in competition law. The notification system introduced in 1991 led to the establishment of a substantial body of Competition Authority decisions which has produced much certainty and given much guidance to business enterprises.</P>
    <P>Regarding enforcement changes made in 1996, it may be too soon to reach a definitive verdict, <Col N="40" /> but the initial results are reasonably encouraging. Certainly, the introduction of criminal sanctions for breaches of competition law has greatly increased the deterrent value of the competition regime and may have helped to change attitudes towards anti-competitive behaviour generally.</P>
    <P>The most important policy change proposed in Part 2 is the rebalancing of the imprisonment penalties in section 8 to reflect the gravity of different types of anti-competitive behaviour. The current statutory provisions relating to penalties for offences under competition law are set out in section 3 of the 1996 Act. These provide for penalties or fines up to a maximum of £3 million or 10% of annual turnover and of imprisonment up to a maximum of two years. The new maximum fine provided for in section 8 will be &euro;3.8 million, slightly less than the level of 1996. No change is proposed in the penalty relating to turnover.</P>
    <P>Regarding the imprisonment penalty, the Bill introduces a new distinction in sections 6 and 8 between two categories of infringement, increasing the imprisonment penalty from two to five years in the case of the more serious category, such as price fixing, and abolishing it for the less serious category. The new five year maximum penalty, which also makes the offence an arrestable one, sends the clearest possible signal that blatantly anti-consumer activities such as price fixing will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Part 2 also makes a number of important technical changes relating to criminal procedure for competition offences. These relate to presumptions, defences, fines, provision of information for juries and evidence. These changes, in conjunction with the new approach to penalties, are primarily designed to facilitate the prosecution of serious competition offences while taking due account of the rights of accused persons.</P>
    <P>Part 2 also provides for the abolition of the notification system. The number of notifications has declined considerably in recent years suggesting that the level of understanding of the substantive rules regarding anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices among the business community and its advisers is now quite high. A second reason for abolishing the notification system is, as I indicated, that there is every likelihood that the comparable EU system of notification will be abolished when the EU draft Council regulation for the modernisation of EU competition law is adopted. The current system of notification will be replaced by the direct application of the relevant statutory provisions. The Bill retains in section 4(3) a power for the Competition Authority to issue category declarations which will be broadly similar to the category licences under the 1991 Act.</P>
    <P>Two important and related changes are provided for in Part 3. First, it is proposed to transfer from the Minister to the Competition Authority responsibility for examining and deciding upon mergers generally based on competition criteria only. Second, it is proposed in the case of mergers <Col N="41" /> in the newspaper and media sectors to retain a right to intervene where the protection of certain stated public interests requires such intervention.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation the Minister is responsible for merger control and, while he or she can refer a merger proposal to the Competition Authority for investigation and report, it is the Minister who makes the final decision on all mergers notified. The competition and mergers review group considered at length the question of who should control mergers. While the group was divided on the issue, a majority recommended that merger proposals should, in the first instance, be notified to the Competition Authority with the final decision resting with the Minister on stated public policy grounds. I was concerned that a two-tier approach would create a more cumbersome regulatory system than the existing one. At present more than 95% of merger notifications are cleared following an initial assessment and without referral to the authority.</P>
    <P>In considering the CMRG's recommendation, I also questioned whether a reformed mergers regime should rely on non-competition criteria in the assessment procedure. Most competition experts maintain mergers should be assessed by reference to competition criteria only and while I believe there is a theoretical justification for the use of non-competition criteria, decisions have very rarely been influenced by such considerations. In light of that fact and to provide as simple and speedy a regulatory procedure as possible, I have formed the view that merger notifications should be determined by reference to competition criteria alone.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe the Competition Authority, as the specialist body, is the appropriate forum for undertaking the required competition examination and analysis. Its personnel are well placed to assess mergers expertly, impartially and free from party or lobby affiliations. In light of these facts, I propose to de-politicise the merger control system and transfer the function to the independent authority so that in future mergers will be examined and decided upon using competition criteria alone.</P>
    <P>The second policy change, which arises out of the first, concerns the treatment of mergers and acquisitions in the newspapers-media sector. In September 1995, my immediate predecessor established the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. This was against the background of various difficulties in the newspaper industry, including the events which led to the cessation of the <i>Irish Press</i> titles. The commission, under the chairmanship of the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay, reported in June 1996 making 16 recommendations, three of which were relevant to merger control over newspapers. The essence of these three recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, as adapted by the CMRG, was, first, that certain public interest criteria, including the competitiveness of the indigenous newspaper industry, plurality of ownership and titles, maintenance of <Col N="42" /> cultural diversity and cross-media interests should be taken into consideration in the case of newspaper-media mergers, and, second, that the scope of merger law should be extended to include the acquisition of control over newspapers-media by means other than the acquisition of shares or assets.</P>
    <P>The basic issues we must address in deciding how to legislate for these difficult areas are as follows. First, should any special arrangements be made relating to the control of mergers and acquisitions in the media sector? If so, what form should those arrangements take? Specifically, what substantive tests or criteria should be applied in the examination of media mergers. Who should apply these criteria and how do we ensure appropriate accountability? To those questions I suggest the following answers. The products or services offered by the mass media of newspapers, radio and television are different from the generality of consumer products and services in at least one vital respect. We depend on them significantly for information and views about the world in which we live. The material they provide influences how we see the world, how we interpret events and, to a significant extent, our attitudes and even our behaviour. This has a particular relevance to the operation of our political system. The proper functioning of our democratic system depends ultimately on liberty of expression and all that entails. Excessive concentration of media ownership and control involves risks that go beyond those involved in the case of ordinary goods and services.</P>
    <P>The test proposed in the Bill for the examination of ordinary mergers and acquisitions is whether the result of the merger or acquisition would be to substantially lessen competition in markets for goods or services in the State. Neither the Commission on the Newspaper Industry nor the Competition and Mergers Review Group found themselves able to recommend a purely economic criterion of this kind for the media sector. The approach they took was to seek to identify specific public interests that should be considered and taken into account in the case of media mergers and to have those interests enshrined in legislation. This is done in section 22(9) of the Bill in the definition of &ldquo;relevant criteria&rdquo;. This sets out five considerations which address concerns that are specific to the media sector.</P>
    <P>On the issue of who should regulate media mergers, that should follow from the nature of the tasks involved. The Bill, in effect, proposes a sharing of responsibilities between the Competition Authority, the courts, the Minister and, ultimately, the Houses of the Oireachtas. Media mergers which do not raise public interest concerns will, in practice, be controlled by the Competition Authority acting on the basis of the competition criterion and subject to the normal right of appeal to the court. I expect this will dispose of the great majority of cases. In those cases where there are reasons for concern on broader public interest <Col N="43" /> grounds, the Minister will be able to require a full investigation by the authority and, no doubt exceptionally, to overturn a final determination of the authority. This power of the Minister will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny under section 24. This arrangement of responsibilities reflects the competences and responsibilities of the institutions concerned and provides for desirable checks and balances. It could work well and prove sufficient to safeguard the public interest in this difficult area. However, I am open to any new suggestions or proposals on the subject and will give careful consideration to any that come forward in the context of this debate. One possibility could be to confine the ministerial power to positive decisions of the authority, that is, that a decision of the authority prohibiting a media merger on competition grounds could not be overruled by the Minister on public interest grounds.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted covers all existing technologies for the transmission and re-transmission of radio or television. However, it is possible that future technologies will enable radio and-or television to be transmitted or re-transmitted in ways which might not be covered by the current definitions in the Bill. In order that there should be no doubt as to what is covered by the Bill, I intend introducing on Committee Stage an amendment which will make it clear that all technologies for the transmission and re-transmission of radio or television will be covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 3 also contains a considerable number of technical changes. In general terms, the effect of those changes is to bring our merger control regime closer to that of the EU merger regulation following the recommendations of the CMRG report.</P>
    <P>Part 4 continues in being the Competition Authority and makes new provision about its functions. The authority is now just ten years old and it is possible to form a view of its performance. The authority has established itself as a competent professional executive agency carrying out its statutory functions to a high standard. It has gained widespread respect both in Ireland and internationally.</P>
    <P>I have decided not only to retain the current collective nature of the authority, as a body comprising a number of persons, but to enhance the role of the chairperson broadly in line with the CMRG report. The collective nature of the authority is emphasised, in particular, by section 28(4) which requires the authority not to delegate certain key functions in the Act. These functions include the power to initiate proceedings for an offence under sections 6 and 7 or to make a determination in merger cases following a full investigation.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes provision in section 28(1) for a new advocacy function for the authority. I place particular importance on this as an instrument for bringing about change in business culture. Some attitudes towards the notion of competing, or <Col N="44" /> rather of not competing, are rooted deep in tradition and culture. Many of the problems have to do with the interface between business and Government itself. An example of this is the era of price control which may have contributed to a sense of &ldquo;not rocking boats&rdquo; within particular business or trade communities. The authority is already playing a very valuable advocacy and educational role and the Bill recognises and provides for this.</P>
    <P>Part 4 also includes a number of changes which will strengthen the independence of the authority. Section 27(3) makes express provision for the first time for the independence of the authority. Increased autonomy in financial and staffing matters is provided for in sections 36, 37, 39 and 41.</P>
    <P>Section 32, co-operation between the authority and certain statutory bodies, provides a statutory framework for practical co-operation between the authority and the sectoral regulators listed in schedule 1. This provision, which is wholly new, and is based on the advice of the CMRG, will underpin and enhance existing levels of co-operation between the relevant bodies. The inclusion of the Broadcasting Commission is particularly relevant to the media merger area and it should contribute to greater coherence in the overall monitoring of the media sector.</P>
    <P>Part 5 provides for miscellaneous matters such as repeals, expenses and saving and transitional provisions. I should comment specifically on section 46 which empowers the Minister to amend or revoke the 1987 groceries order. The purpose of this provision is simply to allay any doubts as to whether the order could be amended or revoked subsequent to the repeal of the Competition Act, 1991. As I indicated in the Seanad, I have no proposals at present to amend or revoke the order.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the result of a process of careful preparation, as befits a policy area of this complexity and importance. It takes account of the best independent advice available to Government, relevant EU developments and experience in implementing the current arrangements. If enacted, it will sharpen the focus on serious competition wrongdoing; take merger control out of the political arena; foster a new approach for handling competition problems in the media sector; and strengthen the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide a sound modern framework for the promotion of competition throughout the economy over the coming years and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for her general outline of the Bill's provisions. Rarely have I heard such a ministerial contribution with which I almost wholeheartedly agree. I would find it very difficult to take serious issue with any of the points made by the Tánaiste. I hope that, given the broad welcome from my party and this side of the House, we can ensure that we proceed to Committee and Report Stages as speedily as possible. Notwithstanding the current time con<Col N="45" /> straints being experienced by the House and the rush of legislation on the part of many Ministers, all of whom appear to have more than one eye on certain events that will take place later on in the spring, I hope we can reach agreement on this Bill. It is important that all stages be passed before the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Competition Bill before us represents an important policy plank towards the building or maintaining of an enterprise economy. The object we all have is to ensure that Ireland is one of the best places in the world in which to carry out business, trade and commerce. Enterprise and productivity should comprise the cornerstone of all economic policy. That is reflected in the changing, revamping and modernisation of our competition law.</P>
      <P>Promoting enterprise will boost Irish business and improve our own productivity. The Bill strengthens competition and the power of consumers by reforming our competition law, smashing cartels and restrictive practices and promoting the concept of new protections for consumers. The promotion of enterprise will foster the business skills of Irish people. Vigorous competition between firms is the lifeblood of strong and effective markets. Competition helps consumers achieve a good deal. It drives innovation, incentive and productivity.</P>
      <P>Decisions on competition should be taken by a strong, proactive, independent authority which should have the power to tackle all forms of anti-competitive behaviour. There should be a strong deterrent package, which we have in the Bill, and injured parties should have a right to redress. The basic objective should be for greater international consistency and co-operation throughout the EU and even beyond its borders.</P>
      <P>As we know, cartels are highly damaging to the economy in general and consumers in particular. Competition between businesses protects consumers. In markets that lack effective competition, firms realise that consumers have little or no choice but to buy from them, so customers can be treated in an unfair manner. With strong competition, firms are forced to work hard to win and keep their clients. As a result, it drives down prices and drives up choice and quality. This is most noteworthy in areas which have moved from monopolies to more open markets, as we have in this State over the past ten years. Productivity is the main factor that determines our living standards. Raising productivity holds the key to long-term prosperity in any state, our own included.</P>
      <P>Competition is not the only driver of productivity. Enterprise, innovation, skills and investment are also important. A vibrant competition environment and regime is vital to ensuring that our enterprise is moving in top gear. Strong competition regimes encourage open dynamic markets and, through them, innovation and value for consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as the Tánaiste has said, can be divided into four main parts: the application of articles 81 and 82 of the EU treaty, the criminal <Col N="46" /> sanctions in respect of hard-core and other offences, the mergers and beefing up of the office of the Competition Authority. All these parts have been very much welcomed by my party.</P>
    <P>One area that I feel we should dwell on now, although we will have an opportunity to discuss it on Committee Stage, concerns criminal sanctions. The object of the exercise is to ensure that criminal sanctions are present in the Bill to discourage cartels and restrictive practices and to ensure there is a stick approach. Criminal sanctions have always been the bulwark in ensuring matters are above board. Where competition, enterprise and commerce are concerned, I wonder what will be the effect of the criminal sanctions we have in our competition law which will be strengthened by the current legislation. The 1996 Act included a strong criminal deterrent as does this Bill which distinguishes between serious criminal offences and less serious offences.</P>
    <P>The position from which the Tánaiste and her Department are coming is that a perpetrator of a crime in the area of business, commerce and competition should suffer the same fate as, for example, as tax evader, burglar or somebody engaged in the commission of a criminal offence as we know it. This Bill, with its strong criminal deterrent, seems appropriate and within reason. However, we should ask whether it such deterrents work. We should examine the criminal sanctions of 1996 and ask what the track record on criminal prosecutions has been like since then. In all, we have seen over 100 dawn raids by the Competition Authority. Resources have been sought and, ultimately, provided.</P>
    <P>One can never achieve a set of circumstances in which sufficient resources are available to anybody, but I acknowledge the Tánaiste's efforts, particularly in the past six or eight months, to ensure that the Competition Authority has the necessary tools of the trade to allow it exercise the functions it was designed to have. However, even with increased resources, the 100 dawn raids and campaign undertaken by the authority do not appear to have achieved the objective set out in the 1996 Bill and reinforced in this one.</P>
    <P>The number of successful criminal prosecutions are few and far between, in spite of the existence of such strong deterrents. What we have witnessed is largely a procedural difficulty. Many cases appear to proceed by way of documentary evidence, video evidence and witness statements, all of which are submitted to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, the evidence does not appear to come out at the other end. We must acknowledge that a difficulty exists in terms of the criminal sanctions not achieving their ultimate objective. Many of the cases that have proceeded tended to be long, tedious, labyrinthine sessions which went on for weeks on end.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note some of the comments of the eminent judges charged with the responsibility of hearing these cases. They have spoken of the difficulties involved when expert is pitted <Col N="47" /> against expert and economists give counter evidence to colleagues until it is almost impossible to achieve a result. If this is to continue to be the case, we could arrive at a situation where the law would be in disrepute. It is important, therefore, that we look for an alternative if the criminal sanctions are not working.</P>
    <P>If the criminal sanctions are merely in place to act as a deterrent and unworkable, we must look instead at the possibility of applying economic sanctions. Fines are effective when imposed on businesses. However, I would like to see the Competition Authority initiating proceedings and imposing fines. There may be a constitutional barrier to this, but the matter should be teased out and tested. Other jurisdictions, albeit with different codes of civil and criminal law, seem to have no difficulty in empowering the appropriate regulatory bodies with the power to engage in the process of prosecution. If we can, we should proceed and give the Competition Authority the power to initiate a prosecution. While there is a strong argument in favour of criminal sanctions and jail sentences being ultimately imposed by the court, the reality is different. The civil remedy of injunction and the economic remedy appear to be more realistic, as well as being far more practical.</P>
    <P>The Bill is particularly weak on redress of an injured party. Similar legislation proposed in Britain opens the way for injured parties, or those affected by unlawful anti-competitive behaviour, to seek redress. Previously, damages were only possible where a firm had failed to comply with certain legal obligations, not for anti-competitive behaviour which in consumer markets can be particularly difficult to detect. Where there are large numbers of consumers and most firms operate in a similar way, consumers often will not know whether they are getting a raw deal. Individual consumers rarely have access to the information necessary to sustain a complaint. Therefore, we should consider empowering consumer groups which have a crucial and important role to play.</P>
    <P>The Bill may have missed an opportunity to strengthen the voice of the consumer. A group such as the Consumers Association of Ireland could be empowered to act on behalf of individual consumers and bring what might be described as a super complaint to the Competition Authority. The authority, in response to this super complaint, could establish a fast-track mechanism of ensuring priority was given to a complaint made by a recognised body, such as the Consumers Association of Ireland. These cases would be brought when people suspect that there are market structures or practices working against the individual consumer. The Consumers Association of Ireland would be an appropriate body to be empowered to put super complaints concerning situations where markets fail to work for consumers, rather than the activities of particular <Col N="48" /> companies. The Competition Authority would be empowered to fast-track these super complaints and undertake preliminary work to establish whether there was sufficient evidence to support a complaint. Where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case, the authority would proceed directly to the use of competition and consumer powers.</P>
    <P>There must be a special focus on implementing the law and ensuring consumers and the public are familiar with the terms of the legislation. In this regard I acknowledge the attitude of the recently appointed chairman of the Competition Authority, Mr. John Fingleton, a fellow Laois man. He has done something to improve the public persona of the Competition Authority. Many consumers do not know of its existence. It does not have a high public profile. It is important, particularly in the context of this new reforming legislation, that we engage in a public campaign explaining the importance of competition to the consumer and the citizen. We must explain the significance of decisions giving rise to increased competition and the powers of the Competition Authority. I am sure the Minister would facilitate the adoption by the authority of a high profile advocacy role where competition could be promoted and the functions and role of the Competition Authority made well known, perhaps by taking the authority to the streets in a public information campaign to let the people know of its existence, powers and functions. People must be made aware that we have a body of legislation on a par with anything in the European Union and beyond.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a consolidation of existing legislation. I welcome the greater enforcement powers given to the authority, in line with the report of the competition and mergers review group, which reported a year ago. This was an expert body representing interested parties in the competition area, chaired very well by Mr. Michael Collins, SC. The group engaged in a substantial and significant review of existing legislation and made important recommendations, although not all have been included in the Bill. A number of these omissions have been highlighted by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation. I share the concern of that group regarding the power of the Minister to veto mergers that might be contrary to the public interest. The Minister is aware that the CMRG recommended that the Minister should exercise such a veto in cases considered contrary to the public interest. Under the new Bill, the Minister does not retain this power of veto. Mergers will be decided by the Competition Authority, solely on economic grounds. The only mergers in which the Minister will have any input will be media mergers, as she pointed out in her opening address.</P>
    <P>I share the concern that the public or national interest is not sufficiently protected. If a merger is proposed which might be sound from an economic point of view, but damaging to the national interest, neither the Government, the Minister nor the authority would have power to intervene <Col N="49" /> to protect the public interest. Public interest can mean different things to different people in different circumstances. However, most OECD countries have allowed for the protection of the public interest or national security in their legislation. This situation was illustrated by the Woodside case in which an Australian company which owned the Australian gas reserves was the subject of a takeover bid by Shell. The Australian Government prohibited the merger on the grounds that to allow a multinational company to take ownership of the Australisn gas reserves would be contrary to the Australian national interest. If a similar scenario were to arise in this country, under the Bill the merger would go through.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, in the Seanad, made reference to an amendment which would allow the Competition Authority to adjudicate in secret on a merger if there was a question of public interest. Such an amendment would be designed to accommodate the fears of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance that if the Government wished to rescue a failing bank or insurance company by having it taken over by a sound insitution before the public realised the problem and might cause a run on a bank, it might be prevented from doing so. I refer to the rescue of the ICI by the Government in 1985 or a potential problem in a bank such as the AIB, should it reveal another rogue trader.</P>
    <P>Whether deals put together in secret by senior executives are the only way of dealing with this matter and whether the deals should be made exclusively in secret are issues that can be teased out on Committee Stage. I am not sure that not having such a public interest test is something that will produce a body of law that will best serve the people and the State. If we deal with strict, hard nosed economic criteria alone, we might not be acting in the public interest. There should always be a public interest clause and if it were under the guise of national security, that would be preferable.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no provision for consumers or competitors of a firm that is merging or being acquired to appeal to the High Court if they feel the authority has not acted fairly. The best informed watchdog of anti-competitive practices by a company must surely be its competitors. The Bill appears to have no place in the appeal process for those who have a trading relationship with the merged company. There is no alarm procedure for notifying clients or competitors of a proposed merging company that the Competition Authority has received notification in accordance with the legislation that the merger is to be proposed. That is something we can look at again. The Bill requires the authority to give public notice within seven days of receiving the merger request but it does not say if they are working days. This could give rise to difficulty over the Christmas period or in August when the seven day notice might not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" />Neither does the Bill provide that the notice given by the authority should be accessible by a normal business person without unnecessary expense and inconvenience. The chance of missing a merger notice at some time during the year must be high but the penalty for missing such a merger notice might be severe and there appears to be no grounds for appeal afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the right of a private action to aggrieved or injured persons but the Bill has no application if one is aggrieved over a merger. Only businesses performing the merger can be categorised as being aggrieved if their wishes are in some way frustrated. This should be looked at again with a view to providing for some form of third party procedure.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that in the course of the debate in the Seanad the Tánaiste attempted to accommodate a number of ideas put forward by Opposition Senators. They were that appeals should be capable of going to the Supreme Court, that there should be open competition for membership of the Competition Authority and that the authority's independence should be bolstered by giving it the right to publish its annual report, rather than submitting it to the Minister who would publish it at a later stage. I note that other amendments were accepted in principle by the Tánaiste and that she will proceed to have them drafted for Committee Stage in the Dáil, which I expect to take place early next month.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill that gives rise to concern is the reversal of the burden of proof in favour of the prosecution, which is inserted at various stages in the Bill. This will surely act to the detriment of the defendant. It goes against one of the fundamental tenets of our criminal law, that it is up to the person making the case to prove the point. One of the justifications for this change in approach is the difficulty for an applicant in discharging the high burden of proof. The presumption of anti-competitive behaviour obliges the court to presume, unless the defendant can prove otherwise, that the object or effect of the agreement, decision or concerted practice is to prevent, restrict or distort competition.</P>
    <P>This issue has arisen in other areas of the criminal and taxation law but it must only be in the most rare circumstances that this House should transfer the burden of proof by discarding a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, which presumption represents a fundamental principle of our criminal justice system. The provision is included to make it easier to secure prosecutions but if this basic principle were applied across the board, it would alter to the detriment of our people one of the fundamental pillars of our democratic system. This reversal or change in the burden of proof is intended to relate to hard core offences where there is an agreement or decision or concerted practice. However, any law which provides for a fundamental change in the burden of proof should be met with concern. Perhaps we can discuss this issue further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" />There has been much discussion on media mergers. I listened with interest to the Tánaiste's explanation of the reasons for retaining power to herself and her successors with regard to media mergers. I was a little surprised, having regard to the public interest involved, that the Valentia Eircom acquisition was not referred to the Competition Authority. It appears the Minister is relying on some whistleblower informing her Department if there is a breach of the commitments given as a condition for her permitting the acquisition of Eircom by Valentia. The undertakings given appear to be grounded in secrecy. The secret dealings or undertakings entered into behind closed doors appear to be unique. It is extraordinary that the terms of the commitment were not published.</P>
    <P>Some questions were answered but the information was given in a drip feed manner rather than being volunteered. Some of the undertakings were outlined in the Official Report but the information was not so much volunteered as extracted. The commitments relate only to the cable TV firm, Chorus, in which Independent News and Media has a substantial financial interest, but the major player involved has a substantial financial interest in Independent newspapers. Were Chorus, for example, to set up a telecom business using its Chorus cables, it could take telephone traffic away from Eircom. There appeared to be no commitment given in relation to a potential clash between the Independent group and Eircom. If Eircom were to launch into the publishing, news or entertainment business across the telephone lines, as many phone companies have done in the US and Europe, it would attain political and cultural power as an important media player. The major shareholder would then be in a position to influence both a nationwide electronic publisher and his existing Irish newspaper group.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome the fact that the Minister proposes to retain to herself and successor Ministers the right to determine the outcome of media mergers. However, it is at odds with putting all other industries under the sole jurisdiction of the Competition Authority. I welcome the Minister's assertion that the media merger must overcome two hurdles, the Competition Authority and the public interest clause. She suggested that the ministerial power should perhaps only be exercised in relation to positive decisions of the Competition Authority. I agree with that; it is probably more appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the launch by the Competition Authority before Christmas &ndash; a launch which was not widely heralded &ndash; of the new concept of immunity against criminal prosecution for a cartel member who blows the whistle. This is good for businesses who are victims of cartels and for the consumers who ultimately pay for cartel profits. It is also good for the Competition Authority, if it can make its threat of prosecution of cartel members a reality rather <Col N="52" /> than an aspiration. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions collaborated substantially in the arrangement. It is an interesting concept. The immunity from prosecution is applicable to the first member to come up with the information the Competition Authority needs to prosecute other cartel members.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Competition Authority has identified the pursuit of cartels as a top priority. The immunity programme outlines the policy and procedures involved in applying for immunity and makes transparent the policy of both the authority and the DPP in considering applications for immunity in cases of self reporting of cartel activities. Applications must be made to the designated officer within the Competition Authority. It is important that people know exactly with whom they are dealing.</P>
    <P>One point that is not referred to in the Bill is the matter of whether other regulators, such as the telecoms regulator, should be given powers to pursue their own regulated bodies, for example, Eircom, Esat, Vodafone, ESB, Bord Gáis and Aer Rianta, for abuses of dominant positions. This could be done by incorporating an amendment into the Bill which would give equal rights of prosecution with the Competition Authority to the regulators. It is a controversial issue, which I do not have time to go into, but I will return to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Shared jurisdiction exists in the UK where the various regulators of water, energy and telecommunications can pursue abuses of dominance under British law, which is modelled closely on EU law. However, we are putting everything under the umbrella of the Competition Authority. The relationship between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Public Enterprise probably produces an element of conflict and that should be examined. The Competition Authority has not been active in this area. For example, no abuse suits are being pursued against the ESB or Eircom despite repeated complaints from new entrants to their markets. The appropriate regulator should be considered an ideal candidate for a measure of power.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the Bill, which sets about redressing the need to update competition law and I look forward to Committee Stage, where the definition of &ldquo;hard core offences&rdquo;, for example, can be tightened. The definition is broad, as drafted, and open to misinterpretation. We will also be able to examine the difficulties between the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution and the Competition Authority. When the authority completes its work, a file is sent to the DPP's office, which then disappears into a black hole, never to return. I welcome the beefing up of the authority in terms of additional resources to provide more staff and, more importantly, to provide for the enforcement of this legislation. It will be of little value unless it is workable and enforceable.</P>
    <Col N="53" />
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Tánaiste and to the House for being late. This is the third competition Bill in 11 years promising the introduction of tough legislation to stamp out anti-competitive behaviour. I welcome the legislation in so far as it sets out to codify competition law in a single accessible Bill. However, it is fair to measure the rhetoric with the performance in assessing it. What firms have seen is that little or no serious effort has been made to enforce existing legislation. The original Competition Act, 1991, provided no effective means of enforcement. The experience with the 1996 Act is that almost as soon as the authority demonstrated its intention to apply it vigorously, it was stopped from doing so.</P>
      <P>On the criminal side, three files have been sent to the DPP. The authority's chairman, Dr. Fingleton, has been referred to by Deputy Flanagan and I concur with his view that his appointment by the Tánaiste has given a higher profile to competition. I regret that the relevant committee of the House, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, has not given Dr. Fingleton an opportunity to appear before it, despite requests from myself and others, to present the case of the Competition Authority in terms of its role and so on. As Deputy Flanagan stated, Members know little about the authority.</P>
      <P>The chairman is committed to attaining a higher profile for the authority in the future. However, his address to the Bar Council on 26 January was reported in the <i>Competition Press</i>. He stated: &ldquo;We have sent some very serious files to the Director of Public Prosecutions three years ago. It's a concern that he has not been resourced to deal with them expeditiously.&rdquo; I do not know for certain, nor for the purposes of this debate am I required to know, the subject matter of the files in question, but the chairman's conclusion is instructive. There is something wrong somewhere if three year old files have not been progressed. Given the nature of the issues involved, the question must now arise as to whether they can still be progressed. I do not know what the Tánaiste will say on this matter.</P>
      <P>A file on milk was sent to the DPP at the end of 1998 and the DPP directed that the Garda undertake further investigations, which it did. I do not know what has happened since to the file and again the Tánaiste may be able to help the House on this matter. I also believe that the DPP directed that the authority should prepare books of evidence in respect of its investigation into enterprises related to the drinks trade at the end of 2000. I do not know how far this has progressed or what the Tánaiste can tell the House about the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it must be open to defendants in these circumstances to argue for dismissal on grounds of undue or unreasonable delay. The authority chairman's comments to the Bar Council conference are even more stark as they relate to civil cases. He indicated that cases that were instituted as a result of previous investigations are likely to <Col N="54" /> be dropped. I would like the Tánaiste to comment on his statement: &ldquo;It is a huge burden to resurrect files from 1997 to 1999. A lot of stuff eventually can't be brought forward because of lack of continuity. It shows a large policy cost for the savings that were made in resources a number of years ago.&rdquo; This must be hugely frustrating for the staff of the authority and hugely comforting for those being investigated.</P>
    <P>I can trace eight cases where the authority decided to institute civil action during that period, but which are still outstanding. These are proceedings against the Licensed Vintners' Association, announced in an authority press release dated 22 May 1998; proceedings against the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, announced in the same press release &ndash; according to the authority's 1998 annual report, the proceedings allege that both organisations and their members &ldquo;had engaged in agreements, decisions and/or concerted practices to increase drink prices by a set amount in summer 1996 and November 1997 and to fix margins in respect of certain alcoholic beverages on an ongoing basis&rdquo;. Proceedings were taken against a number of dairies and supermarkets in respect of milk prices &ndash; a file on this case was sent to the DPP, according to the authority's 1998 annual report. Proceedings were taken against a number of licensed beer and soft drink wholesalers in Cork, Kerry and Tipperary alleging they had directly or indirectly fixed prices of packaged beers and soft drinks, announced in the authority's 1999 annual report &ndash; a file on this case was sent to the DPP. Proceedings were taken against the Soft Drinks and Beer Bottlers' Association alleging that it had directly or indirectly fixed prices of packaged beers and soft drinks, announced in the authority's 1999 annual report. Proceedings were taken against a number of licensed beer and soft drink wholesalers in Dublin and Wexford alleging they had directly or indirectly fixed prices of packaged beers and soft drinks, announced in the authority's 1999 annual report &ndash; a file was also sent to the DPP. Proceedings were taken against three bakery firms alleging they had directly or indirectly fixed bread prices, announced in the authority's 1999 annual report, and proceedings were taken against Eircom alleging that it abused a dominant position by refusing to grant unbundled access to the local loop, announced in the authority's 1999 annual report.</P>
    <P>I would like to know where these actions stand now and how many are encompassed by the chairman's speech to the Bar Council on 26 January.</P>
    <P>In how many cases have proceedings issued and how many are intended to be progressed to finality? What is the real commercial world with which we are dealing in developing competition policy? What is the attitude of businesses to competition policy and to enforcement agencies such as the European Commission or the Irish Competition Authority? The answer may well depend on factors such as businesses' market position at <Col N="55" /> a particular time, whether they are small or large, buyers or sellers, established or fledgling, dominant in one market and weak in another, national or trans-national, etc. As sellers, some businesses may want the maximum possible market power. As buyers of goods and services or employers of labour, the weaker their counterparts, the better.</P>
    <P>Economists have developed concepts of monopoly, oligopoly, perfect competition, imperfect competition, contestable markets and market failure, some of which have relevance to the real world. In a contested case, lawyers and economists will, for a fee, be used as advocates by businesses that have no interest in any objective merits of competition policy.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned with efficiency arguments and with giving due regard to market signals as often promoting both general equity and consumer welfare, but we must also consider non-market factors and modifying market forces in the interest of a broader philosophy of society embracing choices about social justice, the role of local communities, the desired pace of technological change, increased private consumption or public services and various other issues.</P>
    <P>Legislation on competition policy, mergers and control of monopolies reflects broader choices about social and economic policy and seeks to ensure that the legal profession, big business and powerful bureaucracies are democratically accountable. This brings me to the public interest dimension. At the competition conference before Christmas and in brief exchanges with the Tánaiste's helpful officials, I expressed the view that the Bill's definition of the media &ndash; the business of production of newspapers or magazines or radio or television broadcasting &ndash; is disappointingly narrow. Surely new platforms of transmitting information should be included, either specifically or by using language sufficiently wide to include them.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows the Minister to have a final say in relation to media mergers and to apply certain criteria, which, presumably because they have public policy implications, are not considered to be properly the concern of the technocrats at the authority. These include the diversity of views in society, the maintenance of cultural diversity and other matters referred to by the Tánaiste in her contribution. At least, that seems to be the reasoning behind the Minister, not the authority, making the decision in these cases. Even in the normal cases left to the authority, it is disabled from taking into account considerations of the public interest and must instead apply a mechanical test as to whether the merger would result in a substantial lessening of competition. The oddity is that people call for special rules in relation to media cross-ownership because of the special influence capable of being exerted by those in a position of dominance, not least influence over the political process.</P>
    <P>Most objective observers would say that the managers, editorial people or whoever calls the <Col N="56" /> shots at Independent News and Media are gearing up to support the two parties they supported at the last election. I am not sure if that is the wish of many of the journalists working on the group's newspapers. If the coverage from Christmas is anything to go by, they will have reached quite a crescendo of unanimity by the time the general election is called. I do not suppose that constitutes abuse of dominant position as it is something that goes on in other countries. On the island adjacent to us, it is not unusual for a newspaper group to line up behind one or other political party although this has not happened so blatantly in this country. It is not desirable from the point of view of democracy.</P>
    <P>Going back to the origins of this democratic State, a particular newspaper was self-avowedly the voice of one political party and everybody knew where it stood. The newspaper developed a vigorous independence as time went on and some of the more remarkable political writers wrote for it, irrespective of its editorial line. I fear that will not continue to be the case in some of the newspapers in the Independent stable. Many journalists may continue to be objective reporters of what they see in the political arena but there is a manifest editorial bias. It is not necessary to be partisan, as I avowedly am, to acknowledge that. The question then raised is whether it is adequate in response to put the decision making process in the hands of a politician liable to be subjected to precisely the excessive influence we seek to curb. That is problematic. However, I want to come back to that point because I have a view on what is the answer to my own question.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not contain a straightforward ban on cross-ownership beyond a specific percentage figure. I should not accuse the Tánaiste of suggesting she would put in a specific figure for cross-ownership, but from her answers to parliamentary questions etc., I inferred that might be the case. This would not of course deal with cases of indirect control but I see no reason why the Oireachtas should not legislate to the effect that a concentration of media ownership, beyond fixed limits, is wrong in principle and prohibited, regardless of whether there is proof of a lessening of competition in the market place. There is no reference in the Bill to the role of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. In terms of wider cultural diversity, there seems to be an argument to have enshrined in the Bill some structured reference to, at least, a consultative role for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; set out in the Bill, for the purposes of establishing whether a merger or acquisition is taking place, seems to be sufficiently broad to include a case where one newspaper proprietor acquires control over another title by extending loans to it on what is clearly not an arm's length commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The argument apparently relied on by the Tánaiste in the case of the media raises <Col N="57" /> interesting questions about handing over to the authority all aspects of merger control, lock, stock and barrel, with the exception of the media. I hope we will have the opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out whether this is just fashionable or ideological and whether it is in the interest of equitable economic and social development in Ireland that only competition criteria may be taken into account even in the largest and most sensitive mergers. If one looks back over the history of competitions pioneered in the United States from Rockerfeller and Standard Oil to Microsoft and the Bush Administration there is, whether the technocrats like it or not, a political and public interest dimension to the issue. Fashions come and go and a different fashion seems to have been applied to Microsoft and Bill Gates compared to the Rockerfeller Standard Oil case.  </P>
    <P>I note the work of the Competition and Mergers Review Group in the report referred to by the Minister. She referred in the Seanad to its work as &ldquo;one of the most extensive ever carried out into competition in this country or possibly anywhere&rdquo;. It is worth noting that the review concluded that the &ldquo;final decision on public policy grounds ought, however, to rest with the Minister&rdquo;. Paragraph 6.3.3 of the CMRG report states</P>
    <P>The Group also continues to be of the view that the final decision should lie with the Minister. The basis for this is that while the primary substantive criterion for the review of a merger should be its likely impact on competition, the Group believes that it should also be possible for a merger control regime to take account of other public interest considerations. The Minister, rather than the Competition Authority, is competent to take decisions on public interest grounds and it is for this reason that the Group recommends that the final decision on mergers notified under the Act should rest with the Minister. The Minister's review of mergers should, however, be limited to such public policy grounds only.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6.3.7 states:</P>
    <P>The Group proposes that notifications should be made to the Competition Authority and that the Competition Authority should be required to decide on the basis of competition criteria only. It is in this realm that it is a specialist body. The issue of whether or not the public good, for stated reasons, requires competition considerations to be departed from is an inherently political one and is one that is best taken by a politically accountable person. The Group is satisfied that a certain political element is inherent in any merger control system.</P>
    <P>That is my view. The Minister may disagree with it if she is not the Minister, but the principle is not divisible in that way. We may have views on how our predecessors made decisions against those criteria, but there is an impeccable democratic and accountability argument which says <Col N="58" /> that there is an inherent political element in any merger control system. Paragraph 6.3.7 also states: </P>
    <P>While the Minister will of course be open to political lobbying, the decision of the Minister, which the Group believes should be fully reasoned and published, will permit full public scrutiny of the Minister's decision. Lobbying the Minister appears to the Group to be a corollary of the democratic process. [Perhaps we should send that line to Mr. Justice Flood as it might be helpful.] Consequently, the Group considers that the structure to be put in place should provide that notification should be to the Competition Authority. The latter body should make the initial recommendation. The final decision on public policy grounds ought, however, to rest with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not sure we have heard sufficient from the Minister as to why she chose to reject that advice and decided instead that these matters should be decided solely on competition criteria by a technocratic authority which is not accountable to Parliament, except for its use of public money, with the exception of the media.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Flanagan, I am concerned that we are taking this important Bill late in the parliamentary lifetime of the Dáil. I appreciate it is a priority for the Minister and we, on this side of the House, have indicated our willingness to facilitate it. We are restricted to speaking for 30 minutes, although we could probably go on longer because few of our colleagues are lining up to make researched contributions to the Bill. Committee Stage will probably be dealt with by four or five Deputies. Notwithstanding that, it deserves more attention than it will get on Committee Stage in a general election environment. That is a pity because some of the concepts are difficult and are judgment calls. There are differences in the House in terms of philosophical outlook and values of competition policy. In view of the hurried manner in which the Bill will be put through the House, I am not sure we will be able to adequately tease out why the Minister praised the work of Mr. Michael Collins and his colleagues on the review group and yet rejected a cardinal recommendation to which it gave a lot of thought. I do not have any doubt that the authority, including its staff, is comprised of conscientious expert and dedicated people who will come to their demanding tasks with their own values, prejudices and professional expertise. The Minister may believe she has depoliticised merger control, but there is no such thing as a pure technocratic position which is devoid of social and public interest.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to provide a modern legislative framework for the promotion of competition policy in Ireland. It is valuable that key features of the law relating to competition, monopolies and mergers are brought together in a single statute. I am also persuaded that in so far as we are ambitious for economic <Col N="59" /> growth, it is important that our economy is competitive in the trading sense and that we are enabled to generate growth by increases in exports, which we have managed to do in the past decade in particular. We are one of the most open economies in the world in terms of ratio of foreign trade to GNP and the freedom of movement of capital. I suspect we may differ as to the extent that reformulation and extension of competition law has contributed to that economic growth over that decade. However, competition policy and sectoral regulatory issues have gradually come more to the forefront in Ireland and in the future, due to the further diminution in the status of national economic policy decision-making arising from economic and monetary union and the reduction of national policy instruments, that will continue to be the case. There is a pro-consumer dimension in a country where, until relatively recently, there was not any consistent resourced consumer voice.</P>
    <P>In spite of the Minister's frequent protestations of her pro-competition stance, there has been a failure by the Minister to provide the necessary resources. Criminal prosecutions have been delayed, the authority chairman has indicated that civil actions may have to be dropped and several investigations have been halted. The Minister will now claim that she has at last ensured the authority will have adequate staff. I would, however, be confident, without knowing this, that the authority must have warned her of the implications.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to have much tougher penalties for what the Minister describes as &ldquo;hard core cases&rdquo; than for other types of anti-competitive behaviour. Most economists and competition lawyers would make a clear distinction between two broad classes of anti-competitive behaviour. The first category is blatant cartels, which involve price fixing &ndash; including agreements on margins, price increases or maximum discounts; bid rigging; market sharing. The assessment of such practices is clear and unambiguous. There is no evidence that they have any beneficial effects, in fact, quite the opposite &ndash; they reduce efficiency and clearly harm consumers because, effectively, they are a rip-off.</P>
    <P>The second category involves everything else. This includes what are called vertical agreements &ndash; exclusive distribution, franchises, etc., and alleged abuse of dominance. The point is that the distinction between abuse of dominance and aggressive competition can be very fine. While vertical agreements may be anti-competitive in a particular set of circumstances, they are often beneficial in the sense of promoting efficiency, etc. Logically, such behaviour should be treated less severely, even when it is actually anti-competitive. It may not be possible for firms to know in advance whether they have crossed the line. If the penalties are too severe, it might actually discourage people from competing strongly for fear of prosecution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" />In the United States, for example, cartels are, <i>per se</i>, illegal under the Sherman Act. In other words, in a cartel case the prosecution is required to prove that those involved agreed to fix prices pure and simple. There is no bringing in a raft of economists or experts to argue whether that is good or bad. The law states it is bad.</P>
    <P>The authority chairman, in his address to the Bar Council conference, reportedly stated the new Bill did not give a good definition of hardcore offences and did not make these offences, <i>per se</i>, as they are in the United States. I quote, &ldquo;In the US you can't offer the sorts of defences under section 6(4) of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting the comments of the current Attorney General, Mr. Michael McDowell, at a seminar in TCD in June 1995:</P>
    <P>Price-fixing, bid rigging and market sharing offences would have to be specifically created. One cannot simply criminalise all anti-competitive agreements or practices as such. Still less could one imagine criminalising all behaviour which amounted to abuse of dominant position.</P>
    <P>In short, the offence has to be one which any Joe or Josephine Soap sitting in a jury box can easily see falls on the wrong side of a clearly established line. We can't have the situation in which companies are in perpetual conclave with their legal advisors as to what aspect of their behaviour does or does not fall within the ambit of any proposed offence. Any new offences must be simple, obvious, and generally understood.</P>
    <P>He proceeded to state:</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if modern procedures, rules of evidence and evidential presumptions are introduced, it should be possible to simplify serious offences of price fixing, bid rigging or market sharing into a form that can be easily prosecuted, easily understood by the jury and the public, and in which the court is not weighed down with a mass of documentation and technical evidence which makes the trial unduly long or cumbersome.</P>
    <P>Not all observers would agree that the current Bill could be described as meeting the requirements outlined by the Attorney General. I would like the Tánaiste to indicate the reason she decided against simply making the operation of cartels a criminal offence. In the United States, if individuals can be proved to have fixed prices, there is no need to hear long, complex economic and expert advice that this is a bad thing to have done. In practice, trying to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a firm abused a dominant position is at least problematic. The authority chairman acknowledged this when he stated non-cartel cases would &ldquo;only rarely achieve the burden of proof for criminal fines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I regret that I do not have time available to contribute further to the debate on this major Bill. I have a number of other points to raise and <Col N="61" /> hope I will get the opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted for the opportunity to comment on this important legislation which will repeal existing competition legislation and should codify our national competition laws into one item of legislation. This is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>As someone with a background in business and commerce, I am keenly aware of the role and importance of competition in ensuring consumers get the best value, best choice and are empowered to make decisions about the choice of goods and services they wish to use. If consumers do not have a competitive choice, there is a greater possibility that they will suffer poor service, pay higher prices and obtain inferior goods. Clearly, a competitive market is the best safeguard to ensure consumer welfare.</P>
      <P>The State has a vital role to play in ensuring the environment for business encourages risk and enterprise, because without enterprise there is no competition. It is important that the State removes obstacles to the enterprise culture, which has played such a vital role in building the vibrant and successful economy we have today. Achieving a competitive environment for the conduct of business and the provision of goods and services involves much more than just enacting legislation to establish or reinforce the powers of a Competition Authority. Government legislation and policy in a range of areas must not just pay lip-service to competition policy, they must strive to create and sustain an enterprise culture that encourages entrepreneurs to take risks and invest. That is the key to growth in any business. Government policy must be focused on removing obstacles, increasing efficiencies and rewarding risk-takers. Unless this is central to policy, we will not encourage budding business people to take risks to provide consumers with competitive choice in a range of goods and services. The only way to encourage competition is to have many people operating in the same area of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a result of a long-term review of competition policy by the competition and mergers review group. It confers considerable additional powers and responsibility on the Competition Authority and quite extensive powers in the pursuit of its statutory functions. I understand it will give the authority power to enter people's homes to search for records, documents and materials. It is important that we constantly review and assess the conferral of such extensive powers on statutory or public bodies. Providing such extensive powers confers an enormous responsibility on the authority to conduct itself in an effective, efficient and honourable manner. Any organisation with such powers and responsibilities must prove its worth and not become a self-perpetuating bureaucracy. It must justify its existence and confer benefit on consumers. It is also important that it does not add to the burden many businesses face on a daily basis and that its <Col N="62" /> procedures, objectives and goals contribute to the achievement of greater efficiencies in the economy.</P>
    <P>I know that some business people believe that the authority, which has been established since 1991, has yet to prove its worth. The authority and the entire regime of competition legislation were not born out of any pressing demand in the early 1990s for a new all-powerful body to tackle perceived cartels, abuses of dominance or anti-competitive agreements in the economy. It emanated from proposals produced by the Progressive Democrats which achieved prominence when Deputy O'Malley became Minister for Industry and Commerce under the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. The authority's powers were strengthened in 1996 by my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the competition and mergers review group carried out a further analysis, issuing a final report in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if we have ever carried out a cost benefit analysis on the Competition Authority to see whether the considerable powers and responsibilities it received from the Oireachtas have been justified. Has the consumer benefited from the work the authority has carried out? Has it assisted in the removal of any barriers to trade or reduced any inefficiencies in business? Is the authority and the procedures it adopts an additional burden on developing an enterprise culture? Does it adopt a practical and consumer focused approach to the conduct of its affairs? It is difficult to recall an individual instance where the consumer has benefited from direct intervention by or activity on the part of the authority. However, I am aware of many situations where large businesses have benefited from its involvement and intervention in specific commercial disputes. I suspect the authority may yet have to earn its spurs when it comes to securing respect from consumers and wider business interests for its functions.</P>
    <P>In order to earn this respect, it is vital that the authority operates and acts in an environment that recognises the commercial realities of the marketplace. I know that its members are fine and expert people and that it has individuals of the highest calibre among its staff. However, I wonder if the authority might sometimes be over-academic and narrowly focused in the way it conducts its business. From my own first hand experience, I believe the authority has sometimes looked at issues solely through the eyes of economists and shown little regard for the real commercial world of business and consumers.</P>
    <P>Over a number of years, the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business carried out detailed studies on the grocery and distribution sector in Ireland and issued a number of considered and researched reports. However, someone in the Competition Authority took it upon themselves to criticise us publicly in intemperate and unbalanced terms. There was a failure on the part of the authority to recognise that our function as <Col N="63" /> policy makers is not just to look at issues through the eyes of economists but also to address issues in the round. However, a robust session with the authority cleared the air somewhat. I acknowledge the Minister's influence in relation to the grocery order, which has facilitated a balanced approach to trade activities.</P>
    <P>I would welcome greater interaction and communication between the authority, the business community and consumer groups. The current chairman of the authority has taken some important steps in this regard, but I suggest more can be done by the authority to establish its worth to business and consumer interests. I would also welcome greater interaction between the authority and policy makers as we can each learn from effective engagement. I hope the Tánaiste will take account of the benefit of having the authority come before an Oireachtas committee each year to outline its work programme and strategic objectives over the ensuing year. It is also important that the authority should focus on its basic role and some level of parliamentary accountability would assist in that regard.</P>
    <P>I refer to an issue which the Tánaiste might address in her reply on Second Stage and also on Committee Stage. The regime established by the Competition Acts confers a considerable advantage on large businesses and has a disproportionately negative impact on smaller businesses. A large business can take a decision that has a negative impact on smaller businesses or individual operators. If smaller businesses combine to respond to such an initiative, the likelihood is that the Competition Authority will be down on them like a ton of bricks. There are many instances where the authority has gone after representative and trade associations that have responded to actions taken by larger or more dominant players in the marketplace. The IFA, the licensed vintners, the veterinary profession and travel agents have all come under the focus of the authority in circumstances where they have tried to represent their members' interests in disputes with larger companies.</P>
    <P>There is an important balance to be struck in such cases. Representative and trade associations should not act to restrict competition, but it is equally important that they are allowed to represent their members in issues that affect their livelihoods. Representative organisations, such as IBEC, have played a central role in achieving social partnership and it is critical that the regime established by this Act does not restrict that role. The law confers certain benefits on trade unions to represent the rights of workers in collective negotiations. It is worth examining whether the role of representative and trade organisations should be recognised and encouraged in this Bill. It should be possible for those organisations to operate effectively, without fear of incurring the wrath of the authority and perhaps the interaction between such representative associations and <Col N="64" /> the authority might be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that representative organisations might be so restricted in their roles that they lose their credibility and relevance. I am not talking about permitting representative organisations to arrange cartels or anti-competitive agreements, but there must be cases where such organisations are justified in having collective negotiations on commercial or trade issues with larger companies. The absence of effective representative organisations is not in the national or public interest and it is important that the regime established by this Bill facilitates their continued role.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention a number of specific comments on key issues in the Bill. The aim of the Bill is to improve efficiency and remove obstacles to the conduct of business, but I am concerned that some aspects of it might restrict innovation or enterprise. One such area relates to the current requirement of large Irish companies that are conducting business abroad to notify transactions to the authority. An increasing number of Irish firms are seeking to expand their export capacity through acquisitions in overseas markets. At present, the acquisition by an Irish firm of a business abroad is subject to the prior notification obligation of the Acts if the Irish acquirer and the business being acquired meet the thresholds specified in the Acts. The notification requirement even applies where the business being acquired has no activity in Ireland and where the acquisition has no effect on competition in the State. This is nonsensical and amounts to an unnecessary imposition on Irish enterprises and on the authority.</P>
    <P>Another issue relates to the time limits the authority applies for the consideration of mergers and notifications under the Act. I understand that 98% of transactions are cleared by the Minister at the first stage of the review process and it is expected this will continue to be the case. However, the 2% of cases that go for further review are likely to be extremely significant in terms of their complexity, scale and economic impact. I am concerned that any Irish company operating in an international environment might have to wait up to 120 days to learn if a proposed merger is likely to be acceptable. This would be a particularly onerous burden in the case where a company is a plc and is obliged to underwrite any offer for the period when a deal is being considered by the authority. Of course, such transactions merit detailed and serious consideration by the authority, but can it be done any quicker than the current four months time scale in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would see merit in allowing companies a procedure that facilitated a fast-track approach to the second stage. Perhaps the Bill might contain some provision that allowed parties to elect to bypass the initial 30-day investigation of the transaction by the authority and move directly to the three months consultative phase. Bearing in <Col N="65" /> mind that the Bill is concerned with increasing efficiencies, reducing costs and enabling business to be done in a competitive environment, I would have thought this suggestion might find some favour with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister needs to provide for some formal interaction between the authority and the Oireachtas and I hope she will bring forward proposals in this regard on Committee Stage. I suggest the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business would be an excellent committee with which the authority could interact. I also see considerable advantage in the Minister providing for a statutory competition advisory council that would include representatives of consumer groups, business interests, her Department and the authority. This body should have an advisory role to the authority and the Government on competition policy issues and it would not have any function in dealing with individual cases. Such a body would certainly assist the authority in convincing business and consumer interests of its worth and would sharpen the commercial focus of the authority.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that the Competition Authority has sufficient resources to fulfil its statutory functions and to prove its worth over the years ahead. There is no point in our providing a legislative framework if we do not give adequate resources to allow the authority to perform its functions. Up to now, the authority was seriously underfunded and had relatively little capacity to deal with competition issues. Consumers are entitled to expect a free and open economy and an enterprise culture should be strongly encouraged. This Bill has been discussed by an expert group that was set up five years ago and reported in March 2000. It was chaired by Michael Collins SC and engaged in a comprehensive review of our existing competition legislation and made intelligent, sensible and well received recommendations. Not all of these recommendations have been taken on board in this Bill; indeed some have been rejected or abandoned. Perhaps that Tánaiste could indicate why each recommendation was abandoned. I would like a report on what was excluded from the initial review by Michael Collins SC and why. It is important I receive this information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>One example is the groceries order. I was well aware of the Deputy's lobbying on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good example. We have to give the Minister credit for that. I have already mentioned it. The report also recommended that the Minister should veto mergers contrary to the public interest. Under the Competition Bill, 2001 the Minister does not retain that power and mergers will be considered by the Competition Authority solely on economic grounds. The only mergers into which the Minister will have any input will be media mergers. This does not protect the public or national interest because if a merger <Col N="66" /> was proposed which might make economic sense but would be damaging to our social or national fabric then, almost uniquely in OECD countries, there would be no power for the Government to intervene in the public interest. Most of our European counterparts have this protection built into their own legislation and we would be unique in abandoning this right. A recent Australian case uniquely illustrated the danger.</P>
      <P>Not enough attention to the powers of authorised officers has been given in this Bill and significant problems will arise unless these powers are specified in legislation, particularly those of the gardaí who will accompany members of the Competition Authority in dawn raids and other authorised activities. This point needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>Merger thresholds will be increased by the Bill, however mergers which involve multinational companies based here but not involving an Irish branch should not be the subject of Irish competition legislation. For example, if Elan acquired a company outside Ireland, there would be no direct impact on competition law here and they should therefore not have to notify the competition authority. This is something the legislation should address given the high level of foreign investment and the large number of multinationals based here.</P>
      <P>The Bill is draconian in the extent and effect of its investigative provisions. I am concerned with the reversal of the onus of proof which requires the accused to do the Competition Authority's work for them and disprove the case against them rather than have it proven, as is the norm in criminal matters. Not only does this potentially raise constitutional matters but it will be unworkable in practice, clog up court time and prove expensive given the complexity and length of cases that would result. Such an effect will ultimately damage the reputation of Irish competition law and enforcement agencies. For example, a defendant must prove that the action being pursued did not have as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition. This means that the defendant must provide heavy economic evidence to prove that the effect and not the execution of the alleged offending action did not harm competition. Invariably this means having economic evidence to analyse in considerable detail the relevant market. This should be the role of the Competition Authority and not the defendant.</P>
      <P>I am delighted I have had time to speak on this important legislation. It has been debated for five years under review and the Tánaiste has in many respects brought a level playing field to competition which is welcome. I hope she will come back on some of the issues I have raised because it is important they are raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to comment on this legislation and in general I welcome it. However, I remind the Tánaiste of the things we have said and done in this area <Col N="67" /> in the past. At the time legislation was enacted supposedly to end all dispute and debate in certain areas. Obviously, that is not the case because this proposal is to amend relatively new legislation. That said, I recognise the need for doing that regularly and I support it.</P>
      <P>I recognise there is a need for the Competition Authority and the job it does, but after this legislation the Minister will have less responsibility and the Competition Authority will have more. That is fine, but it is also part of the progress towards removing the responsibility of the Minister to the House. This has come up in almost every Bill that has come before this House since I was elected. We have handed over responsibility to fine, well structured and necessary authorities but along side that, when we ask a parliamentary question, we are told the Minister has no official responsibility to the House. I can already see the replies to the parliamentary questions which worries me because competition, responsibility and authority relate to accountability and when one hands over responsibility, in whatever shape or form, the authority given the responsibility should be accountable to the Minister and the House.</P>
      <P>I mention that particularly in the aftermath of the debate we had on the Treaty of Nice when it was clearly identified that while there was accountability to Government and to the Minister in almost every area of legislation, with every passing day there is a decreasing amount of responsibility and accountability to the Houses of Parliament. We live in a democracy and the further we go down that road, the more dangerous it becomes. I ask that the Minister tries to ensure that, notwithstanding the proposals in the legislation, we at least in this House have the privilege of raising questions and asking the Minister to give an account of their stewardship and ultimately the stewardship of the agency concerned. That would be good for democracy, accountability and for the House in terms of not handing over responsibilities to other agencies. I cannot over emphasise that issue, which I and other Members have raised many times.</P>
      <P>For example, in relation to questions about FÁS throughout the country, a typical answer is that the Minister has no responsibility to the House. I can think of countless other agencies to which that applies.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste correctly mentions the newspaper industry. She raises three questions, namely, whether any special arrangement should be made in relation to the control of mergers and acquisitions in the media sector; if so, the form these arrangements should take and specifically the substantive tests or criteria that should be applied to the examination of the media; and the question of accountability. In unique fashion, the Minister sets about answering her own questions. It is a good technique and I fully appreciate what she is trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" />As the global economy expands there is an increasing need to be vigilant in the areas in question. In the first part of her reply, the Minister refers to that, the major moguls who operate world-wide and the service they provide. However, there is grave danger built into that also. There is a necessity for the Minister to recognise that some of the major players in smaller countries may be swallowed up by powerful multi-national corporations in the media industry with the power and influence that comes from playing in the international arena. One or two companies in the electronic and print media come to mind. I do not know to what extent such organisations have any regard for competition or democracy or anything else. I am quite certain there are countless incidents where complete and absolute disregard is shown for these concepts. I do not know to what extent the Minister can exercise control in that area, particularly if the responsibility is to be handed over to the Competition Authority. How will the authority be able to hack it with some of the bigger players in that field? News, information and the means of disseminating that information is power and the Minister would do well to have a closer look at the degree to which that power could be abused. I do not want to go into particular instances at this time but the Minister knows well that I am referring to the huge power and authority that runs alongside the major players in that field.</P>
    <P>How much, if at all, has the consumer benefited from competition in the insurance industry and does competition even work in this area? If cartels are being operated for quotations through all the aspects of the insurance sector, is it not a coincidence that all the so-called competitors in the field seem to have the same answers regarding their costs, higher outgoings and higher costs of claims which in turn justifies the right not to quote at all or to quote exorbitantly. To what extent have the competition laws in the past been invoked or enforced to encourage the people who have control in that area. The Minister will say her Department has no direct responsibility, but her Department does have some responsibility in this regard. Whether the competition forces the prices upward or downward should be a matter of concern to the Department with overall responsibility, even though the Department does not fund it directly. It is extraordinary that people here should have higher premium costs than those in other EU countries. The arguments we have heard from the industry do not stand up to scrutiny. The same criteria should apply to competition here as it does in other countries and if that is the case then the consumer does not get the benefit of it. The only ones benefiting from it are the various corporations that are in the business of providing the services and that is not the way it was intended to work. It is recognised that whatever competition laws apply in regard to that industry throughout Europe, they are not applied here. The Minister and her Department need to get directly involved, to knock heads together <Col N="69" /> where necessary to encourage those who are providing the services to also provide competition in a meaningful way, as opposed to the semblance of competition.</P>
    <P>The benefits to the consumer would be reflected in the economic performance of the country. Powerful corporations are in the business of imposing a penalty on consumers in particular countries, above and beyond that which prevails in other jurisdictions and, accordingly, the producer in that jurisdiction will be less competitive than its competitors in other jurisdictions. It is of critical importance that that would be dealt with as a matter of course. The Minister may well say that is a issue that will be dealt with in other legislation but we have been a long time waiting for action in this area and nothing has happened to date and the legislation in hand is unlikely to impinge on this area.</P>
    <P>The need for competition, other than predatory competition, in all aspects of business enterprise and provision of services is obvious to everyone. The consumer is the one who pays at the end of the day. Some practices that on face value may appear to be competitive, could have anti-competition undertones. Predatory pricing and below cost selling are two areas I wish to highlight. The Minster has already referred to this in the Minimum Prices Groceries Orders over the years.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that the provider of a service, the wholesaler or major corporation who is in a position to impose stricter penalties on the producer, forcing the prices downwards will ultimately lead to benefit for the consumer in the short-term. The bigger the corporation buying the product from the producer the greater its influence to force the price down and ultimately put itself in a better position economically. It can either pass the benefits on to the consumer or can retain it. The bigger the corporation the greater the danger of abuse in this area. In recent years, and despite continuous probing by Members of the House, the degree to which that practice is being used has increased.</P>
    <P>Many people will refer to various products that are being used as loss leaders in the supermarkets and shops simply to encourage people into the premises to sell other products that are more highly priced. The product of choice for loss leader changes from week to week and the result is not beneficial to the customer, but hugely beneficial to the provider of the service, in that case the retailer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, having regard to the Report of the Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann on a draft Code of Conduct for the Members of Dáil Éireann, which was laid before the Dáil on 1st May, 2001, and noting the legislative requirements of <Col N="70" /> section 10 of the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, adopts the following Code of Conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann other than office holders:</P>
    <P>Recommended Code of Conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann other than Office Holders.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Preamble</P>
    <P>Members of Dáil Éireann other than office holders (referred to hereafter as &ldquo;Members&ldquo;) recognise that it is in their individual and collective interest to foster and sustain public confidence and trust in their integrity as individuals and in Dáil Éireann as an institution. To this end, Members should at all times be guided by the public good and ensure that their actions and decisions are taken in the best interests of the public.</P>
    <P>Members are in the unique position of being responsible to the electorate which is the final arbiter of their conduct and has the right to dismiss them from office at regular elections. Accordingly, and as a matter of principle, individual Members are not answerable to their colleagues for their behaviour, except where it is alleged to breach the obligations to answer to them which have been placed on Members by law, by Standing Orders or by Codes of Conduct established by the House.</P>
    <P>To this end and in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 15.10 of the Constitution, the Members have adopted this Code of Conduct, the purpose of which is to assist Members in the discharge of their obligations to the House, their constituents and the public at large, without, however, trespassing into areas where Members more properly submit themselves to the judgment of their electors rather than the jurisdiction of this House.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Code</P>
    <P>1.Members must, in good faith, strive to maintain the public trust placed in them, and exercise the influence gained from their membership of Dáil Éireann to advance the public interest.</P>
    <P>2. Members must conduct themselves in accordance with the provisions and spirit of the Code of Conduct and ensure that their conduct does not bring the integrity of their office or the Dáil into serious disrepute.</P>
    <P>3. (i) Members have a particular obligation to behave in a manner which is consistent with their roles as public representatives and legislators, save where there is a legitimate and sustainable conscientious objection.</P>
    <P>(ii) Members must interact with authorities involved with public administration and the enforcement of the law in a manner which is consistent with their roles as public representatives and legislators.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" />4. (i) Members must base their conduct on a consideration of the public interest and are individually responsible for preventing conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>(ii) Members must endeavour to arrange their private financial affairs to prevent such conflicts of interest arising and must take all reasonable steps to resolve any such conflict quickly and in a manner which is in the best interests of the public.</P>
    <P>5. (i) A conflict of interest exists where a Member participates in or makes a decision in the execution of his or her office knowing that it will improperly and dishonestly further his or her private financial interest or another person's private financial interest directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>(ii) A conflict of interest does not exist where the Member or other person benefits only as a member of the general public or a broad class of persons.</P>
    <P>6. Members may not solicit, accept or receive any financial benefit or profit in exchange for promoting, or voting on, a Bill, a motion for a resolution or order or any question put to the Dáil or to any of its committees.</P>
    <P>7. Members must fulfil conscientiously the requirements of the Dáil and of the law in respect of the registration and declaration of interests and, to assist them in so doing, should familiarise themselves with the relevant legislation and guidelines published from time to time by the Committee on Members' Interests and the Standards in Public Office Commission as appropriate.</P>
    <P>8. (i) Members must not accept a gift that may pose a conflict of interest or which might interfere with the honest and impartial exercise of their official duties.</P>
    <P>(ii) Members may accept incidental gifts and customary hospitality.</P>
    <P>9. In performing their official duties, Members must apply public resources prudently and only for the purposes for which they are intended.</P>
    <P>10.Members must not use official information which is not in the public domain, or information obtained in confidence in the course of their official duties, for personal gain or the personal gain of others.</P>
    <P>11.Members must co-operate with all Tribunals of Inquiry and other bodies inquiring into matters of public importance established by the Houses of the Oireachtas.'</P>

      <P>The code has been under consideration for a considerable period. The Dáil, the <Col N="72" /> Seanad and a great many professional bodies have been looking at introducing codes, indeed some professional bodies have had codes in place for quite a long time, as have many parliaments throughout the world. The above code refers to Members of the House, other than office holders, and I pay tribute to my committee colleagues for the work they put in over a long while in the preparation of it.</P>
      <P>We worked from a draft code which was put before the House initially in February of last year as part of a Labour Party motion. Subsequently, the draft code was referred to the Committee on Members' Interests on 7 February and it was that committee which has produced this code. In so doing, the committee sought submissions from each Member and a number of individuals were forthcoming. The committee also sought submissions from the political parties and the Green Party, the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil all contributed on 12 April last year. A debate took place at that time. The committee then proposed a draft code of conduct with a considerable amount of attendant material and put it before the Dáil on 4 May last year. The adoption of the code was provided for with the introduction of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 2001 on 10 December. The committee was required to formally move this motion today based on that. In the meantime it has consulted with the Standards in Public Office Commission with regard to the code's content.</P>
      <P>The committee was faced with a number of options when it was considering how it might draw up a code. One such option was that the code function as a general guide for Members and that is what the 2001 Act provided for. Some were of the view that a code should be extremely prescriptive and detailed, but one of the difficulties of going down that road is that it is hard to prepare an exhaustive code. It was decided that the legislation clearly provided for a code which would act as a guide. On that basis, the committee brings this proposal before the House.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the backgrounds to demands in many fora and among the general public for a code of conduct and ethics legislation. We have seen that the alleged wrongdoing of decades has been paraded in public fora and tribunals during a relatively short period of time. Aside from that, there is a genuine belief among Members that there is a need for the system to be open to reasonable scrutiny and accountability, and the code provides specifically for that. It is there to assist Members to discharge their duties while acknowledging that there are areas where Members should more properly submit themselves to judgment by the electorate. That is a very important point and one which should be borne in mind in the context of the code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to impose penalties for breaches of the ethics legislation enacted between 1995 and 2001, has been raised recently. There have, in fact, been considerable changes made by the 2001 Act which effectively begets this code of conduct. <Col N="73" /> Among those changes is the provision that a Member suspended from the House may suffer a financial penalty. That was not the case under the 1995 Act. While the code is fundamentally and specifically a guide, it is clear that breaches of the code would likely be breaches of the 2001 Act also and would be dealt with in the normal manner provided for since the 1995 Act came in.</P>
    <P>Section 10(7) of the 2001 Act provides that a person to whom the code applies shall, in so far as is relevant, have regard to and be guided by the code in the performance of his or her functions and in relation to any matters to which the code relates. That is a fairly wide provision defining how and in what circumstances the code applies. The level of complaints against Members which is possible is very clear from the legislation and the punishments which might be meted out are considerably expanded. The code sets out in clear and brief terms what is expected of Members. It contains 11 points, which I am sure Members, a number of whom took the chance to make their own submissions, have had the opportunity to peruse. I thank those Members who took the trouble to contribute. A number of the suggestions from Members and parties were considered carefully by the committee and they formed part of the report which was presented to the Dáil on 1 May last. A number of the suggestions considered then bear repeating.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the code would be a regulatory regime was examined in some detail and the question of apparent conflicts of interest was very carefully examined. The committee agreed that it was unjust to require Members to be accountable and subject to penalty because of a perception by others that there is a conflict of interest where no such conflict exists. That is a fair position to take. For that reason apparent conflicts of interest, which frequently appear to cause trouble, have been excluded from the code. However, provision No. 6 is quite wide ranging.</P>
    <P>We also considered the extent of legitimate public scrutiny of private affairs in the contexts of the code and the legislation. The committee took the view that provision No. 9 was initially too broad and open to all kinds of misinterpretation. It drafted a new provision which clearly sets out what part of one's private affairs can legitimately be considered in the context of public activity.</P>
    <P>A number of people raised the question of whether or not individuals should be amenable to the provisions of the legislation in relation to past events and, on foot of legal advice, the committee took the view that no such provision could be made. There was also a considerable debate on the element of the code which refers to the application of public resources. That area has been covered in the code in a way not done previously in any other code or in regulations of the House.</P>
    <P>An extremely interesting point in the debate came when submissions were being made by various parties regarding the manner in which Members should uphold the law and co-operate <Col N="74" /> with public bodies. The point was made very strongly by a number of those making submissions that there were many occasions when the duty of the elected public representative was not to co-operate with public bodies but to subject to questioning the manner in which particular policies were being pursued and in which particular Departments or other bodies were undertaking their work. The committee addressed that in the code taking very careful account of the fact that there may well be a very substantial number of occasions when Members of the Oireachtas are required to take particular stands which, to some extent at least, put them in conflict with certain public bodies although they are clearly within the law. We provided for that in so far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>There were other areas which did not fall to the committee to consider at this stage, such as when it might be possible or necessary, or in what manner it would be desirable, to amend the code in the future. No doubt there will be circumstances and occasions in the future which will lead people to feel that the code needs to be amended. It is not for the committee to say how that should be done. It is really a matter for future legislation to provide for that.</P>
    <P>For the moment, the committee has very carefully considered the draft code which was placed before it. It has taken on board the order of the House of 7 February 2001, made its report on its draft code of conduct on 1 May 2001 and considered submissions by the Standards in Public Office Commission. Having considered the views expressed by the commission, individuals and parties, the committee commends this code to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael, I support this motion. In accordance with the spirit of the code of conduct, I suppose I should declare an interest because I was a member of the committee which drafted the code.</P>
      <P>Hopefully we have come to the end of a period during which, quite frankly, politics have been brought into disrepute. I hope we now have the dawning of a new year and that that dawn will be all the brighter because we have put in place this code of conduct. Of course adherence to that code by all Members in the future will help to ensure that that dawn will be perpetual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some may criticise us for the fact that the code is expressed in rather general terms. We thought long and hard about how best to do that. We felt that rather than have a detailed and prescriptive code, it was better to lay down broad principles and to expect Members to adhere to those. Therefore, there is a considerable focus on the need to maintain the public trust in Members elected to this House to ensure the integrity of the House is maintained and not brought into disrepute; that Members of the House try to ensure as far as possible that everything they do is consistent with their duty as public representatives; that there is no personal gain and that, in so far <Col N="75" /> as there is any conflict of interest, it is a matter for the Member to resolve that conflict of interest. From that point of view we have laid down a broad series of measures in this code. No doubt if it is fully adhered to, in the future we will not have the kind of difficulties we have had in the past. We also make it clear that public resources must be used prudently and that Members will not use information obtained in an official capacity for their personal gain. It is important to note that the code provides that Members must co-operate with all tribunals of inquiry and other bodies inquiring into matters of public importance established by the Houses of the Oireachtas. From that point of view, the code is part of a new beginning.</P>
    <P>On the question of penalties, it may be a little difficult for the House and, indeed, the general public to understand the rather complex route through which penalties will be applied. When the committee examined this issue initially and compiled a report on the Labour Party motion, we recommended the attachment of specific penalties for breach of the code. That recommendation was not adopted by the Government in the 2001 Act. I can see that one could argue quite coherently as to why one should not have direct penalties, but in one sense this leaves a lacuna as to what happens when the code is breached. We examined this carefully. We thought of recommending that standing orders be adopted to cover penalties but, for a variety of reasons, we decided that would not be the best course of action.</P>
    <P>Our current position on penalties is that there is a new offence in the 2001 Act which introduces an entirely new area of accountability in respect of the carrying out of an act or omission inconsistent with the proper performance by a person of the functions of his or her office or inconsistent with the maintenance of confidence in such performance by the general public. That is a general area about which a complaint can be laid against a Member. Our view is that the code of conduct will be the yardstick or benchmark against which performance will be measured to see whether a person is guilty of that new offence. On that basis, one can fairly say that the penalties provided for breaching that particular section are those which apply for breach of the code of conduct. It is a somewhat indirect way of providing for it but, in the light of the way the legislation is framed, it is the best assurance I can offer at present. Therefore, the kind of penalties which will apply under the new section will be the same as those which apply for the offences for non-declaration of interest etc. under the 1995 Act. Those penalties range from a report to the House involving noting or censure or suspension up to 30 days &ndash; it is now a month &ndash; but the new Act also provides that there can be loss of salary and payments during that period. That is where we stand on the code.</P>
    <P>Returning to my first point, this, I hope, fully marks the end of one era and the beginning of a <Col N="76" /> new one. We should be prepared at all stages to re-examine the code, to see what is happening in other countries, to test it by experience and to review it as required. It is a little presumptuous of me to say we should be very open to do that in the new Dáil. I should say that those who are involved in the next Dáil should be quite prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>I should also say I would be very anxious &ndash; I hope it is not my legacy &ndash; that the ethics legislation would be reviewed by the next Dáil. Frankly I am not happy about the way it is drafted at present. In fact, the way in which this new offence is framed in section 4 of the 2001 Act is quite crazy. It actually specifically excludes non-officeholders and ordinary Members are added back in by reference to a schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite complex and somebody defending a Member on a complaint under the Act would have plenty of legal ammunition. Its potential loopholes should be tied up; I would certainly very much like to see the matter re-examined and reviewed early in the next Dáil.</P>
      <P>I hope we are at the beginning of a new era in which politics will not be brought into disrepute in any way, but there is a danger &ndash; perhaps it is not politically correct to say it &ndash; that one can go overboard from the point of view of corruption commissions and offences against Members. We examined the position in Sydney in New South Wales where they had huge difficulties from the point of view of corruption and allegations of corruption, as a result of which an anti-corruption commission was established. We, the members of the committee, met the members of that commission and, frankly, I thought it had gone totally overboard. They had a permanent commission with 121 employees and an annual budget of $15 million solely directed at trying to root out corruption. The trouble was that when they could not find corruption as we know it in the ordinary sense, they were poking under stones and accusing people who made small mistakes in filling out forms of being corrupt. There is a danger one can go overboard in this area.</P>
      <P>We need to encourage new blood to enter politics and must do so on the basis of trying to have the highest standards. The code of conduct will help to show the level of standards to which we aspire. However, if Members are tied up in regulations and there is a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads to the extent that they can be subject to public odium, censure by the House or worse for the slightest mistake in filling out a form, people will not be prepared to subject themselves to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My plea is for balance. Obviously, I want to see high standards to which the code we will adopt will contribute. However, we should be a little cautious. If there are leading articles in newspapers demanding that public representatives be put on trial for various matters, we should be <Col N="77" /> careful, balanced and strong about what we do to ensure we have high standards and that, as a regulatory body, we insist on them. The test for us will be to ensure the standards laid down in the code of conduct and which we will adopt are maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also declare my membership of the Committee on Members' Interests of which I am privileged to be a member. It is probably the smallest working committee of the House having only five members. It is also unique in that it has an Opposition majority. It has enabled me to have an overview of the workings and minutiae of the House in a way one would probably not get unless one were a party Whip. It is a committee of which I will not be queuing up to be a member in the next Dáil, assuming I am returned as a Member.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because it is a very difficult and onerous task to try to be the internal watchdog of standards in the House. It is also a great privilege. None of the five members would set himself up as a paragon when sitting on judgment on anyone else. It is an extremely difficult job to do when complaints are referred to us for investigation and determination.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Killeen from whom I have learned a great deal. He is an extremely fair and hard-working Member of the House. All the colleagues with whom I worked &ndash; Deputies Jim O'Keeffe, Browne and Brendan Smith who left the committee to be replaced by Deputy Flood &ndash; have given an enormous amount of valuable time and common sense opinions from which I have learned and for which I am grateful to them.</P>
      <P>The issue of ethics and standards is relatively new in terms of legislation. We have always held that this country was very fortunate in terms of public administration, unlike others to which we often referred, in that we did not have major scandals of public corruption. Unfortunately, the recent tribunals have uncovered disquieting aspects of public administration in this country. A wind of change has blown through public administration at every level, not only in the Houses of the Oireachtas, but also in administration in the Civil Service, at local government level and across all aspects of public life. I hope it reaches further. Some of the developments relating to the Garda Síochána and the Judiciary will make for the more accountable public administration system the public demands. All this places a terrible burden on us all. Even the constant filling of declaration forms, which we sometimes find intrusive, is the price we have to pay for getting the balance right in terms of public confidence in administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genesis of the motion was that we would find for ourselves a code of conduct to which each to the best of his or her ability would try to live up. The Labour Party drafted a draft code of con<Col N="78" /> duct and presented it to the House in February last year. The House stated it wanted a code and set the committee the task of devising a perfected one. The chairman, Deputy Killeen, went through the detail of the submissions. It is worth it for every Member to read the report. The individual comments of experienced Members, such as Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Defence and others, to the committee are worth reading because there are practical issues when requirements are laid down in black and white.</P>
    <P>For example, we were all animated by the issue of an obligation on us all to support and help public inquiries, bodies or tribunals. However, there are times when public bodies should not be co-operated with when we suspect they are working against the public interest. We drafted the code to appreciate the nuances of our job as a public watchdog and not to try to set pitfalls. The report makes interesting reading in that it tries to balance the requirement for transparency in our actions while not spancelling our proper work as tribunes of the public to oversee public administration, to act sometimes as whistleblowers and often to receive documentation, for example, as I did in recent weeks as spokesperson on justice. The documentation related to Garda figures which required me to bring the information into the public domain. We have unique roles and are trying to achieve a balance which we have in the model recommended to the Dáil for approval.</P>
    <P>Some of the standards are very high and some will have to be interpreted. Members may ask what is the status of the code of conduct. The original code had no status other than a guideline. However, the one we bring forward today has status because, under the 2001 Act, which is now law, this code will be the yardstick by which our conduct will be judged by the Committee on Members' Interests of the future. We also recommended that we change the name because many think the Committee on Members' Interests deals with the restaurant. We wanted it to be the Standards and Ethics Committee in Dáil Éireann. It would be good if that change were made also in order that people would understand we do not exist to look after Members' interests in terms of the facilities of the House &ndash; there is a committee to do that &ndash; but that we are one of the few statutory committees established under law to ensure Members comply with statutory provisions relating to alleged breaches of the Ethics in Public Office Acts.</P>
    <P>Sanctions will be applied to breaches, not necessarily for direct breaches of the code of conduct, but the code can be the yardstick by which it can be determined whether a breach of the 2001 Act relating to duties of a Member has occurred. The committee which would adjudicate on this would use the code as a yardstick. It is, therefore, important that Members are familiar with, understand the import of and adhere to the 11 points laid out in the recommended code of conduct which I hope will be adopted by Dáil Éireann. Some are onerous obligations and it is important <Col N="79" /> that we understand and try to comply with them to the best of our ability. It is also important that standards are not set too high and that we do not include in a code of conduct obligations which cannot be complied with. A common sense attitude is something which has characterised the deliberations of the committee of which I am a member.</P>
    <P>A better regime is now in place for Members. It is important that we know where we stand and what we have to do. We should know there is a requirement for us to be transparent in our actions and not to act in a way which advances ourselves rather than the general public interest. By way of conditioning people to the work of Deputies, Members could do worse than read the preamble to the code of conduct. It is a good reference for us all in terms of understanding exactly what is our job.</P>
    <P>While the code of conduct is for Members of the House, there will be a more onerous code of conduct for officeholders who, by virtue of their office, have even higher standards to which to adhere. I welcome the presentation of the code of conduct and I hope and believe it will be unanimously accepted by the House. I look forward to the strengthening of public confidence in the Administration in an open and transparent fashion in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the code of conduct because it is not as complete as it should be. I will return to that aspect later. I also want to raise the internal mechanisms of the House which are not being used. I refer in particular to the role of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. A big omission in the code of conduct is not making it an offence for Members to make allegations publicly against fellow Members without first reporting the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Committee on Members' Interests or the commission. The current problem with politics as a profession is not just that a small number of our class misbehaved very badly a number of years ago, but that on virtually every occasion there is a report about some new found fact or allegation, it becomes the subject of political charge and counter charge inside and outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code of conduct is a once-off chance to remedy that situation. As chairman of the DIRT inquiry and following legal advice, I wrote to the leaders of all the parties, the Whips, every Member of the Oireachtas, the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad pointing out that an inquiry by a committee of the House could be prejudiced if, after every hour's evidence, people were to quickly jump to conclusions and raise questions in the form of innuendo and inference and that the inquiry itself could be challenged on the basis that members of the inquiry could be influenced by these inferential questions or charges. Following that letter, <Col N="80" /> there was just one early minor breach of the request that there should be no such comment. This was not repeated and there were no further charges, counter charges or queries of an inferential nature.</P>
    <P>I hoped in drafting the code of conduct that the committee would have deemed it an offence for one Member to publicly raise queries about the conduct of another Member. I proposed a format where Members should first make a complaint about the conduct or declarations of another Member of this House to the appropriate body which would then investigate the complaint impartially and privately and come to a conclusion. No such provision is included in the code of conduct. I raise this issue because I have been the victim of such queries about my declarations of interest, queries which had no ethical or factual basis whatsoever. A political football was made of my declaration. Many people egged me on to raise counter queries about other people's declarations, which I rejected out of hand because that is exactly what I am fighting against.</P>
    <P>If we are concerned about the profession of politics, we should prevent charges of a purely political nature being made against individuals and provide a format where genuine queries can be investigated impartially &ndash; as happened in the case of the former Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe &ndash; findings reached and necessary action taken. This aspect is omitted in the code of conduct. I urge at this stage that it be deemed an offence in the code of conduct for a Member to raise publicly for political reasons unfounded charges or queries, however framed, about the declarations or behaviour of another Member. A format should be laid down where a Member who has a genuine query to raise about the ethics or behaviour of another Member has a proper and appropriate forum in which to do so. If we do not address this issue, this type of problem will occur in the future. Even at this late stage, consideration should be given to an additional section in the code of conduct to cover this aspect. Otherwise we will all live to regret it. Innocent sounding questions can easily tarnish, raise doubts or create enough smoke to ruin another person's reputation, even though there is no basis for the queries in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In the recent past we have had to deal with the problems surrounding Deputy Lawlor, the former Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and Deputy Foley. These issues were dealt with by way of exchanges across the House. When I first came to this House such issues were dealt with in private by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. What has happened to this committee? Has it completely abandoned its role? Surely the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be the master of the House in terms of ethics, procedures and privileges and breaches of them. That is how things always were, but, for one reason or another, that committee does not seem to be operating. This is why there is a need for a Committee on Members' Interests, including <Col N="81" /> other formats and fora. We have ended up with a very splintered set of mechanisms, some of which are in conflict with each other. It is a great pity that a committee whose purpose I always believed was to uphold standards in this House and ensure there were no breaches of ethics, procedures and privileges, but that if there were such breaches, appropriate action would be taken, has broken down. We have seen so many instances of it in past months. We had Deputy Gildea's allegation against Deputy Owen. Was that ever referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?</P>
    <P>It is not many years since I made a factual speech, not one word of which was untrue, concerning a potential conflict of interest. I was forced to make a speech in this House that I did not agree with. I was forced because of pressure from the Government, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, etc. It was not my speech but a speech I was permitted to make by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The point was that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges had that power, authority and role in the past. However, now we have had very serious misbehaviour by some Members, which was not dealt with by this proper process but by allegation and pressure across the House. We had the Deputy Gildea incident and the disreputable behaviour of Deputy Roche in making political footballs out of honest declarations, without the slightest mechanism for having him arraigned and dealt with. These are significant lapses. I doubt that the code of conduct, into which a lot of work has been put by the committee, will have any real effect unless there is the will and determination at the highest level to implement it and ensure it is observed.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make these few remarks. If there was an effective mechanism in both Houses to deal with breaches of privilege and ethics, there would be a much lesser need in the future for tribunals. We all should be ashamed that there has been a need for so many tribunals which, because of their long, draw-out nature, have in the eyes of many become a scandal in themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 96(15) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that permissions for residential development within the scope of Part V will last until 31 December 2002 or for two years, whichever is longer, if the application for permission was made after 25 August 1999 but before the housing strategy was included in the relevant development plan. The Act does not permit the waiver of this provision in respect of particular developments and any arrangement of this kind would require amending primary legislation. I do not intend to sponsor any such amendment to Part V of the Act, which reflects the full and recent consensus of the Legislature on an important policy matter.</P>
      <P>I encourage any developer who believes that he or she will not be in a position to build out their development within the two years available to make an early reapplication for permission. This will ensure development on-site does not have to be halted while the planning application is being processed. In addition, local authorities are being advised to process all such reapplications as quickly as possible to avoid any interruption to the supply of housing while these applications for permission are processed. As consideration will already have been given to the planning implications of a housing development on that site when the first application was made, this should facilitate the speedy consideration of the repeat application. In addition, I have reduced the fee for making a repeat application to one quarter of the normal fee.</P>
      <P>I will keep the matter of the processing of reapplications under review and if it appears necessary to do so, will consider use of other relevant powers under the Planning and Development Act to ensure these applications are processed quickly.</P>

      <P>I understood the reason for this provision at the time but persevering with it now that it has achieved its effect is lunatic. Of all the perverse practices in the area of housing, to persevere with this policy must be the craziest of all. Does the Minister not accept that this will cause a two and a half year gap in housing sup<Col N="83" /> ply? According to his reply, 80,000 houses are already exposed to the likelihood of having to submit further planning applications. If even half of these have to reapply, the planning system will be clogged up, there will be further appeals to An Bord Pleanála, in many cases by people who have already moved into houses and sites will have to be redesigned to accommodate regulations. The cost of houses will go through the roof if half the supply of houses is removed for two and a half years. Will the Minister, at least, consider allowing those who already have planning permission to proceed? They have valid planning applications and there is no reason they should be obliged to apply twice, now that the intended effect of the measure has been achieved.  </P>

      <Quest>his proposals to protect successor tenants who will be exposed to eviction and increased rents following the end of controls in 2002; his plans to introduce enhanced rent assistance for such tenants; his proposals to provide protection against eviction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982 successor tenants are guaranteed a minimum five years tenancy, even where the period extends beyond 25 July 2002. Where the tenancy of a successor tenant exceeds five years, I am advised that such tenants may be entitled to claim a long equity lease of up to 35 years under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. If the landlord is unwilling to grant such a lease, the tenant may apply to the Circuit Court to determine a tenant's entitlement and also to set the rent and other tenancy terms in the absence of agreement between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acquisition of a long equity lease provides significant benefits for tenants. They acquire the right to retain possession of the dwelling and are subject to rent reviews at not less than five yearly intervals. The court, in determining the rent, has <Col N="85" /> regard to market value but also takes into account the addition to the letting value of any improvement works carried out to the dwelling by the tenant. My main area of concern, as I am sure is the Deputy's, will be to avoid the creation of hardship for low income successor tenants moving from a position where rents are set by the rent tribunal &ndash; taking into account the means of the tenant and the landlord &ndash; to a position where the rent approaches the rates applicable in the open market.</P>
    <P>Under the present terms of the special rent allowance scheme operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for tenants in this sector, entitlement to rent allowance ceases when protection under the 1982 Act ceases. Proposals for an appropriate form of means related rent assistance in such cases are being prepared in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and it is intended to seek Government approval of these within the coming weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that in July this year several hundred successor tenants will be exposed to eviction and huge increases in their rents? Many of these tenants are elderly and they are terrified of what is facing them. When will the Minister make an announcement in relation to the proposed new rent allowance scheme for those tenants? Will he bring the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill before the House in sufficient time to provide new legal protection for those tenants so they will not be at risk of losing their homes in July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals for rent assistance in the cases referred to by the Deputy are being prepared in consultation with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and we hope to have them in a matter of weeks. I will keep the Deputy informed in that regard. I have been aware of this problem since 1997. I am working to ensure that the bleak future described by the Deputy will not occur. We have carried out a number of surveys and sent out questionnaires on this issue. The results suggest that just under 400 successor tenants will be affected by the changes that come into effect in July. Only those who have been successor tenants for five years or more will be immediately affected and the survey indicates that they number less than 200. Nevertheless, whether it is 200 or 2,000, we will work to alleviate any distress to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Communications (Regulation) Bill, 2002, which will be published shortly, will propose, among other things, to modernise legislation in relation to road openings undertaken by telecommunications operators. It will provide that the regulatory framework applying to telecommunications operators affords appropriate and updated powers to road authorities to regulate road openings in the public interest while recognising the benefits of further investment in telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I am also considering a wider revision of legislation to deal with road openings undertaken by statutory undertakers generally. In this context, preliminary work on a draft scheme of a Bill on road openings is being undertaken at present by my Department with a view to publication this year. Meanwhile, a utilities and statutory bodies working group, which is chaired by the Dublin Transportation Office &ndash; DTO &ndash; and is representative of the main utilities sectors, is working towards standardising the approach to road openings through agreed codes of practice.</P>
      <P>An integrated transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area over the period to 2016 is set out in A Platform for Change, which was published by the DTO in 2001. The strategy incorporates traffic management as a key element with a view to optimising the use of road space for all users. It also identifies many measures to be taken to this end, including developing a more co-ordinated approach to the planning and management of road works and better monitoring of the quality bus network performance. The steps now being taken in relation to road openings will contribute substantially to the strategy.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's answer; it has been the same for some years. Is the Minister aware of what is happening on the roads? It is absolute war. These works not only cause dislocation of traffic, but destroy roads, footpaths and open spaces. Ironically, commercial companies such as NTL and Esat are complying with local authorities and paying their way. An unjust situation has arisen whereby State and former State companies such as Eircom are giving the two fingers to local authorities and telling them <Col N="87" /> that they have the protection of the State and will have the protection of the courts because of the importance of our infrastructure.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that the ESB, Bord Gáis and Eircom can get away with such arrogant behaviour in respect of the local authorities and at great expense to the taxpayer. It is not a case of infrastructure at all costs. This legislation is vital, and not just for private telecom companies. The statutory providers must also be brought under its remit because they are now in competition with each other. The Department is not displaying any degree of urgency. The Minister has been giving me the same answer for at least four years. Will the legislation in respect of the statutory authorities be published this session?</P>

The Communications (Regulations) Bill deals with the telecommunications sector but we have had an input to that and our legislation will reflect the same type of approach.</P>

      <P>Local authority housing output, including both new build and acquisitions, amounted to 5,022 units last year &ndash; an increase of 1,815 units or 57% on the 2000 output of 3,207 units. This was the highest level of local authority housing completions in over 15 years. In addition, 7,000 local authority housing starts were achieved in 2001 and I am confident that the high level of work currently in progress under the multi-annual programme introduced by the Government should deliver 5,500 completions this year.</P>
      <P>Statutory assessments of local authority housing needs are undertaken on a three yearly basis, with the next assessment to be carried out by each local housing authority at the end of March. The results of the statutory assessment undertaken at end March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts between my Department and local authorities, it is evident that the aggregate level of housing needs has increased since that time. However, an accurate count of needs will only be established by the statutory assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" />The Government is addressing increased social housing needs as a priority through the voluntary housing programmes and other complementary social housing measures, as well as the local authority housing programmes. Last year also saw the highest ever level of voluntary housing output with 1,250 units completed. This compared to 951 units completed in 2000 and 579 units in 1999. Output from all social housing measures along with vacancies occurring in the existing rented housing stock enabled the housing needs of approximately 11,000 households to be met last year. Again, this is the highest level of social housing provision for almost 20 years.</P>

      <P>As he reaches the end of his lamentable five years in office, is the Minister proud of the fact that when he assumed his position there were 26,000 applicants on local authority housing lists and that this figure has increased to almost 60,000? Will he inform the House whether any Government in the history of the State has ever had a worse record in respect of the housing problem? Has any Government or Minister for the Environment and Local Government left office with the numbers on the housing list having more than doubled during their time in power? Is it not the case that the housing provision he outlined falls far short of the commitments, which were themselves limited, contained in the PPF?</P>

      <P>We introduced the four year multi-annual housing programme and increased outputs to their highest level in over 15 years. This year, &euro;755 million has been allocated to the housing programme. That is an increase of over &euro;186 million, or 33%, on last year's provision of &euro;569 million. Over the period of the four year multi-annual housing programme, there will be 25,000 new starts and we have already achieved 48% of these in the first two years. We have given local authorities <i>carte blanche</i> in terms of front-loading their programmes.</P>
      <P>I accept and have stated publicly that local authorities were slow to take up the multi-annual programmes, but they are now taking them up. I am sure that over the next three to four years the high levels of output to which I refer will increase and that the number of people being housed will also increase.

      <P>A public consultation paper on the national spatial strategy, Indications for the Way Ahead, was published last autumn to assist in refining the approach to the strategy and the detailed policies to be included in it. While the period of consultation associated with the paper was scheduled to end on 31 October, submissions continued to be received in my Department <Col N="90" /> throughout November. A total of over 250 written submissions were received from a wide range of national, regional and local bodies, public representatives and individuals. Most of these were broadly supportive of the overall approach to achieving more balanced regional development set out in the consultation paper, but many detailed issues were raised and some reservations were expressed.</P>
      <P>While completion of the NSS was originally envisaged for end 2001, the prolonged public consultation has caused some delay to this schedule. I am confident however that the strategy will benefit from this full consultation and enjoy a wider degree of consensus from the process.</P>
      <P>Since the conclusion of the consultations, work has continued on the drafting of the strategy taking account of the many different points raised in the submissions. In completing the strategy my Department must address the spatial aspects of a wide range of economic, social and environmental policies. This has necessarily involved engagement also with other Departments, agencies and bodies primarily responsible for these policies. I intend to ensure that the strategy will be finalised and cleared with the Government as soon as possible.</P>

It is vital that we introduce some sort of order to our spatial planning system if we are to ever achieve any sort of regional balance.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>In August 2000, the European Commission advised Ireland that it had received a complaint that a fee for the making of a submission on a planning application would restrict citizens' rights to participate in development consent procedures contrary to the public participation provisions of the EIA Directive and contrary to the spirit of the 1998 UNECE Aarhus Convention. Ireland's response of 6 December 2000 explained,<i> inter alia</i>, that the proposed submission fee would in no way contravene the terms of either the directive or the convention and that the Planning and Development Act, 2000, made a number of important changes of primary legislation to confer greater rights on third parties. The long-standing right of public access to planning files free of charge has been continued and indeed enhanced under the new Act.</P>
      <P>In October 2001, the Commission issued a further letter, under Article 226 of the EU Treaty, indicating that the EIA Directive makes no express provision for the payment of a participation fee and suggesting that the submission fee may act as a serious impediment to the expression of opinions and undermine the purpose of the directive. A reply is about to issue to the Commission in refutation of this claim.</P>
      <P>Article 6 of the directive specifies that the detailed arrangements for public participation are a matter for individual member states. The 2000 Act has considerably strengthened public participation in the planning process and I am satisfied that the fee of &euro;20 will not deter any person or body who has genuine concerns in relation to a planning application.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the statutory regulations, the essential repairs grant scheme is <Col N="94" /> operated by local authorities and is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to the authorities. Within broad overall guidelines set by my Department, it is a matter for each local authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in its area, to assess the circumstances of each individual applicant, to decide what works are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants, to determine the level of grants in individual cases and the circumstances in which a grant may be paid. Neither the guidelines nor the regulations governing the essential repairs grant scheme specify an age qualification and a local authority could make grant assistance under the scheme available in the circumstances set out in the question depending on the other individual circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>Apart from the essential repairs grant scheme, local authorities may also pay a grant for the provision of additional accommodation or necessary works of adaptation to a house to meet the needs of a disabled member of the household under the disabled persons grant scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. As this is a matter for individual local authorities, it is the level of funding available to local authorities which restricts the schemes. My local authority is introducing this scheme for the first time this year, but only at a very minimal level because of lack of funding to local authorities, as distinct from the recoupment money being made available by the Department. As I have done on many previous occasions, I appeal to the Minister to increase the discretionary funding available to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point, but I would put it another way. It depends on the level of priority the local authority members put on schemes such as this. In recent years the Department has increased the level of grants allowed. The terms have been changed to increase the levels from &euro;2,286, the maximum prior to 1998, to &euro;9,530 now. We also changed the recoupment rules from half to two-thirds of the amount, subject to those limits. If the local authorities have specific problems within their own budgets they must try to prioritise by focusing spending on essential repairs grants rather than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The question referred to the 65-year age requirement. Most local authorities apply that rule which was probably adopted at managerial level at a particular time. I have said to various members of housing SBCs around the country that if that is the policy of their local authority, they have the power to make exceptions as required.</P>

      <Quest>the timetable for the implementation of the national haz ardous waste management strategy published by the Environmental Protection Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national hazardous waste management plan, NHWMP, relates to the period 2001 to 2006. It makes recommendations in respect of four main areas: implementation of a national hazardous waste prevention programme; improved measures for the collection of hazardous wastes from households, small and medium enterprises, agriculture and other sources of unreported hazardous wastes; provision of requisite infrastructure to attain national self-sufficiency in relation to the recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes; and identification, risk assessment and, where necessary, remediation of sites where hazardous wastes were disposed of in the past.</P>
      <P>Under section 26 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, relevant public authorities are required to have regard to the plan and, where they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to recommendations contained in the plan. The plan recommended the establishment of an implementation committee to co-ordinate its overall implementation and, as indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 307 of 26 February 2002, I will shortly invite a range of business, agricultural and environmental organisations as well as relevant Departments and State agencies to nominate representatives to participate on the proposed implementation committee.</P>
      <P>I will also shortly publish a policy statement on preventing and recycling waste, which will include a major national waste prevention programme, encompassing both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Improved collection and reception services for hazardous waste from household and commercial sources are already being put in place by local authorities.</P>
      <P>As regards infrastructure, the plan identifies a requirement for landfill and thermal treatment capacity for hazardous waste requiring disposal to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on export outlets. A private company has announced proposals to develop a hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy in County Cork. As an exceptional measure, having regard to the polluter pays principle, it is intended that grant assistance will be available under the NDP to support the provision of landfill capacity for hazardous wastes.</P>
      <P>The plan outlined a methodology for the identification and risk assessment of closed waste disposal sites. This methodology has since been developed further by the EPA and is currently being applied as a pilot project undertaken by Laois County Council. This pilot project will conclude shortly and is expected to facilitate the development by the EPA of more detailed guidance for local authorities in this matter.</P>

      <P>Given that the implementation group to which the Minister referred was recommended by the EPA report last July and that on 6 November last the Minister told me he would shortly establish it, why is he only now inviting the representatives of industry and other interests to make nominations to it? That shows there is no serious intention on his part to implement the national hazardous waste management plan. Does the Minister support the proposed facility at Ringaskiddy in County Cork? Where can hazardous waste be disposed of in the country in accordance with the terms recommended in the EPA report last July? </P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the implementation group has not already been set up, but other aspects of waste management and control took precedence. I assure the Deputy the implementation group will be set up quickly. The Deputy will be aware of the constraints placed on me by law in relation to individual planning applications or facilities which might be looking for IPC licences. I will not comment on a specific application for the hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy in County Cork. It is best to leave that to the planning authorities, the EPA and the other organisations which have a statutory obligation to make decisions in that regard.</P>
      <P>Most of our hazardous waste is exported, which is not a sustainable policy over a period of time. The plan states that 370,000 tonnes of hazardous waste were generated in 1998, which is the last year for which we have figures. Unreported hazardous waste comprised approximately 55,000 tonnes. That was generated by small and medium enterprises and included batteries, paints and agricultural products. Approximately 19,000 tonnes of spent sheep dip is included in that figure. Most of our hazardous waste is exported. Hospital waste is subject to a contract by the Dublin based Sterile Technologies Ireland Limited. We are not self-sufficient, but we must reach that point. According to the EPA plan, that means providing incineration and special closed landfill for hazardous waste sometime in the future.</P>

I appreciate that he cannot comment on individual applications. As regards the treatment of hazardous waste, the Minister stated that he was prepared to make grant assistance available for additional landfill capacity. Is he prepared to make grant assistance available for the incineration of hazardous waste? Does he support the incineration of hazardous waste? </P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Road Safety Strategy 1998 to 2002 has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out. We are now in the final year of the strategy and real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within its framework. By the end of 2001 there was a 13% decrease in the number of road deaths since 1997 when 472 people died on our roads. There were 1,640 serious injuries on our roads in 2000 representing a decrease of almost 25% on 1997 levels.</P>
      <P>A range of measures has been deployed to bring about these road safety improvements: Garda enforcement has been intensified in relation to speeding, drinking and seat belt wearing; fixed automated speed cameras and evidential breath testing have been introduced and are being further extended in support of this process; research into the involvement of young people in road accidents and the problem of drugs and driving is being advanced; and education and information in relation to road safety is being improved, including joint promotion of campaigns with the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" />By reference to the estimates set out in the road safety strategy in 1998, more than 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998. Preparatory work on the development of the next road safety strategy is underway. All the agencies directly involved in the production of the current strategy, including the National Safety Council, are being afforded the opportunity to fully contribute to that process. The new strategy will have regard to the target currently being promoted by the European Commission of achieving a 50% reduction in road deaths across the Union as a whole over a ten year period.</P>

      <P>If the Houses pass the road traffic legislation this side of the general election, when will the penalty points system be introduced? Will the Minister clarify the position on the funding of the equipment and computer facilities necessary to operate such a system? How much money is being provided by Government and through which Department is it being made available? Has the Garda, which will have to operate the system, been notified and authorised to proceed with the necessary investment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to a new approach to reducing the death toll on our roads and to a quantum move in the level of enforcement and automatic sanctions applying to road traffic offences. The penalty points system cannot be introduced by next October. Does the Minister accept it is a reflection of Government priority that it will refuse to allocate money to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? He obviously did not make any representations to the Minister for Finance to ensure this legislation would be implemented. Does the Minister agree there would have been a return on this money in six months through the reduction by a handful in the number of serious accidents if it had been invested in time? Does he accept the penalty points system will not be fully operational for at least another three or four years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister's Department may pass the legislation in respect of penalties <Col N="99" /> and so on, does he agree that in order to establish a coherent policy in regard to road safety the strategy is useless without proper enforcement? Is he in favour of a dedicated traffic corps, which would concentrate on road traffic prosecutions? While one must accept speeding is a major factor in accidents, does he also agree reckless and dangerous driving are more significant factors, particularly if one travels on long journeys and witnesses the type of driving taking place on our roads with nobody paying a blind bit of attention to traffic laws because of the lack of resources? Does he accept it is all very well to have cameras monitoring speeding at 7 a.m. on a major motorway when there is little traffic on it and imposing penalty points on offenders, but if the same person drives in a reckless fashion later in the day, there is nobody around to impose a penalty? Does he agree that without a proper dedicated traffic corps, the road strategy is useless unless there is coherence in its implementation between his Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell said the question referred to a new approach. We are coming to the end of the current road safety strategy and the high level group has commenced its work on the next one. We are the first Government to draw up such a strategy and have the courage to set targets by which it could be measured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about implementing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>While we exceeded the target in regard to injuries, we have not achieved the target in regard to fatalities, which is regrettable, but have six months remaining. We will have to wait and see. However, it is important to make these points to underline the Government's commitment to road safety. No previous Government committed itself in the same way to road safety and reducing the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads. All Members want to reduce the numbers quickly.</P>
      <P>The penalty points system is only one element of the road safety strategy. Some believe it will be the be all and the end all of road safety and deaths will be reduced immediately upon its introduction. I do not expect it to be that dramatic. I expect it to have a positive effect, but Deputy Barrett is correct that it will require enforcement because if people believe there is no enforcement, there is no point in having such a system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that is constantly made about the penalty points system is that everything will be all right the minute it is introduced and it will a dramatic effect. Such a system was introduced in Northern Ireland and it did not have a significantly dramatic effect. However, if it is combined with the other measures, to which Deputy Barrett referred, it could have a significant effect.</P>
      <P>I commend the Garda in regard to enforcement thus far but agree with Deputy Barrett that greater enforcement is needed. There has been an increase in the number of detections of drink driving from 8,415 in 1998 to 12,864 in 2001. One could say that it is great that the Garda has increased the number of detections, but is it not a shocking indictment of society that despite all the debates in this House and elsewhere and the various publicity campaigns, that number of people still drink and drive? I am in favour of a dedicated traffic corps.</P>

This was the highest level of local authority housing completions in over 15 years. In addition, some 7,000 local authority housing starts were achieved in 2001 and I am confident that the very high level of work currently in progress under the multi-annual programme approach introduced by the Government should deliver some 5,500 completions this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to unauthorised waste activity is received in my Department from a number of sources, including complaints from members of the public, representations by public representatives and media reports. The scale of the waste activities in question would encompass, for instance, littering, very small scale dumping of bags of household waste, fly-tipping of lorry loads of waste and dumping of burnt out vehicles and end of life vehicles, as well as cases of large scale and organised dumping activities, such as those discovered last year.</P>
      <P>Under section 59 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is responsible for supervision and enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area. Neither functions of this kind, nor the investigation of unauthorised waste activities, have been conferred on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Accordingly, allegations in relation to unauthorised waste activity are not catalogued in detail by my Department. However, any apparently substantive complaint or notification regarding alleged illegal waste activity would normally be referred to the relevant local authority for attention and appropriate action. It may also be considered appropriate to refer matters to the EPA in certain circumstances.</P>

    <P>When the recent and very serious cases of unauthorised waste dumping in Wicklow were brought to my attention, I requested the Garda Commissioner to consider the possible involvement of An Garda Síochána in investigating such activity. I welcome the subsequent decision of the Garda Commissioner to assign a substantial team of officers from the National Bureau of Criminal <Col N="104" /> Investigation to conduct a full-time investigation, in conjunction with relevant local authorities and other appropriate public bodies, of current allegations of criminality or suspected criminality in connection with illegal dumping.</P>

      <P>Is it the Minister's view, and his information, that the extent of the recent illegal dumping in County Wicklow is confined to that county or is what we have seen in County Wicklow indicative of an epidemic of illegal dumping throughout the country? What does the Minister intend to do about the problem of illegal dumping, which now appears to be much more prevalent than anybody had thought?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very foolish for anybody to say there is not any illegal dumping of this kind in other areas. All I can say at present is that I am not aware of such organised illegal dumping taking place anywhere else. Some questions have been raised in relation to County Kildare and I understand that is being investigated. I do not think there is an epidemic of it, but nor do I think the type of activity in question is solely confined to County Wicklow. There may be similar incidents in other counties but that is a guess and is not based on any specific information currently available to me. What was the second part of the Deputy's question?</P>

In the South Dublin County Council area alone there are 28 sites that are un-investigated.</P>

That is what will happen. Enforcement by local authorities in relation to the Waste Management Act or the Litter Acts when I came into office was very poor and lax but it has improved considerably. I have increased the level of funding to local authorities by an average of almost 100%.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>There has been a major increase in the number of planning appeals coming before An Bord Pleanála in recent years. The board received 5,219 and disposed of 4,998 cases in 2001. This compares with 3,424 cases received and 3,237 cases disposed of in 1996. The board accords priority to cases involving development with significant employment generating potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and the board have been addressing on an ongoing basis a range of measures to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously and to discharge the new functions transferred to the board by the Planning and Development Act, 2000. As a result, significant additional staffing and financial resources have been allocated to the board. In summary, <Col N="106" /> during my term as Minister, board membership has been doubled from six to 12, the authorised staff complement stands at 138, an increase of over 50, 79 planners have been engaged &ndash; mostly from abroad &ndash; on a fee per case basis to provide reports on the smaller types of appeals, seven consultancy firms have been engaged to provide reports on the larger cases and a panel of consultants has been set up to hold hearings in relation to motorway schemes, CPOs and other procedures devolved to the board under the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I anticipate that all of these measures will enable the board to eliminate the backlog of appeal cases by mid 2002.</P>
    <P>I have also been concerned to ensure adequate staffing levels for local authority planning departments, who have already been improving their productivity to deal with a large increase in applications for planning permission. I have approved numerous requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional planning posts, both professional planners and administrative staff. Staffing of local authority planning departments has almost doubled over the last four years from 660 in June 1998 to 1,284 in October 2001, involving significant recruitment of planners from abroad. I am confident therefore that the resources available to the planning system are increasing and will continue to increase over the next number of years as a significantly expanded number of graduate planners becomes available from the educational institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not disagree with what the Minister had to say in the earlier part of his reply, but even with the huge additional resources it is still insufficient to meet current needs. Does he not agree that if there were more planners, more appeal officers and more personnel in An Bord Pleanála there would be more industrial and commercial activity? In Dungarvan we lost 1,000 jobs because of a delay of a year by An Bord Pleanála in giving a decision. Can the Minister give us hope that that situation will be redressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy hope that any delays in an Bord Pleanála will be addressed because of the measures I outlined which I will not go back over now. A substantial number of the positions that were vacant in An Bord Pleanála have been filled. For that reason, I can say that the backlog will be cleared by the middle of this year. That indicates that, except in more complicated decisions, the board will be reaching its four month target within the first six months of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the case in Dungarvan where it took a year for an oral hearing to be heard and a decision to be made resulting in the loss of 1,000 jobs? The only planner was the same person who viewed the site and conducted the oral hearing on his own. He had <Col N="107" /> no bevy of assistants. That is surely inadequate in terms of addressing the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter. The accommodation in St. Cronan's junior and senior national school in Brackenstown, Swords, County Dublin is an utter scandal and the responsibility for it lies squarely with the Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Woods, and the former Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Cronan's junior school was opened in 1974 and a senior school in 1977. Since then numerous prefabs and semi-permament rooms have mushroomed up to cater for increased enrolment. Par<Col N="108" /> ents and teachers are totally disillusioned with the lack of progress and one cannot blame them. The school windows are in a dangerous condition where most of them are nailed together and cannot be safely opened to allow for proper ventilation of classrooms. Some rooms have no external doors and the condition of the floors, despite ongoing quality maintenance work has deteriorated. Tiles are broken in corridors and classrooms and carpets are dangerous due to wear and tear and damage caused by flooding and could give rise to an accident. Water and sewage pipes are corroded and one suite of toilets has been closed. In some classrooms the children are no longer allowed to drink the water. These conditions are most unhygienic. There are insufficient staff toilets and classroom facilities. I could go on.</P>
    <P>These are the dreadful conditions under which the children of Brackenstown are being educated. The operation of the schools and the high standard of education provided is due entirely to the professional dedicated and caring approach of the principal, teachers, caretakers, secretaries and boards of management as well as to the parents for their fundraising over the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods received a report in January 2001 part of which stated that the internal sheeting of the window section of the classrooms appeared to be made of asbestos and should be removed. Despite the fact that the Minister visited the school since then and met representatives of the boards of management and the Fianna Fáil public representatives in Leinster House, no inspection has taken place to date, 13 months later. This is a derogation of responsibility and is totally unacceptable. I demand that an immediate inspection be carried out on the schools and a report be issued to me and the boards of management of the schools.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Government had a unique opportunity to deal with the crisis in our education system. Unfortunately this has been squandered, as can be seen by the conditions of the schools, notwithstanding the promises made in 1997. In that year the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, gave a written commitment to the board of management to provide a six classroom extension to the junior school. Nearly five years later there has been little or no progress.</P>
    <P>In a recent reply from the Minister, I was informed that St. Cronan's junior national school is being extended and refurbished as part of the Government's programme and is currently in architectural planning. A proposed building project for St. Cronan's senior national school will proceed to architectural planning as soon as possible under the expanded building programme. Both projects will continue to a preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders <Col N="109" /> as soon as possible under the expanded building programme.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the parents, teachers and pupils of Brackenstown in Swords who feel they have been neglected by the Government, I assert that these empty promises are totally unacceptable to them and I demand the immediate refurbishment of both schools and specific commitments on the time frame of the permanent six classroom extension to these schools. Nothing less is acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>l am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at St. Cronan's junior and senior national schools, Swords, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>At present, St. Cronan's junior national school has a staffing level of principal, twenty mainstream class teachers, two learning support teachers, one resource teacher, and one special additional assistant. St. Cronan's senior national school has a staffing level of principal, eighteen mainstream class teachers, a learning support teacher, a resource teacher and three special additional assistants. The enrolment at both schools on 30 September 2001 was 1,131 pupils.</P>
      <P>The junior school's present facilities consist of 16 permanent classrooms, four temporary classrooms, a general purpose room, shared with the senior school, learning support room, special needs room, staff room, administration office, principal's office, cloakrooms and toilets.</P>
      <P>The senior school's present facilities consist of 16 permanent classrooms, two temporary classrooms, a general purpose room, shared with the junior school, library-medical room, learning support room, staff room, principal's office, cloakrooms and toilets.</P>
      <P>The authorities of both schools' applied to the Department of Education and Science for permanent accommodation to refurbish the existing school and for the provision of an extension of six classrooms plus additional ancillary accommodation at each school. The allocation for primary buildings in 2002 is &euro;153.6 million, which is a record level of funding and demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving accommodation in primary schools, such as St. Cronan's junior and senior national schools, under its expanded school building programme.</P>
      <P>Because of the greatly increased level of activity in the primary buildings area since the Government came into office, there has been a substantial increase in the number of major and minor building projects in construction and this has given rise to a record level of building and refurbishment activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" />Architectural planning is proceeding for the building project at St. Cronan's junior national school.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Minister for Education and Science has recently approved the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning for the proposed major building project at St. Cronan's senior national school. The building unit of his department will be in contact with the school authorities shortly on this matter.</P>
    <P>These projects will proceed through the various stages of the planning process, and to the preparation of tender documents and invitation of tenders, as soon as possible, under the expanded building programme.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Cronan's junior and senior national schools, and I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position on these schools to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter this evening. Two weeks ago today, in response to a priority question, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development informed me that up to 12 February this year 44 flocks had been depopulated and a 45th flock was in the process of being depopulated in the context of the anti-scrapie programme. The Minister said that completed the current phase of the programme. I do not know how many animals are involved in that but it would be quite a substantial number.</P>
      <P>The understanding had been that compensation payments would be made to the farmers concerned within 14 days of the flocks being depopulated. We are now at least 14 days from the end of depopulation of 45 flocks and my information yesterday is that farmers in County Wexford, whose flocks have been depopulated have not yet been paid.</P>
      <P>This is the latest episode in a scheme, which has turned out to be an absolute fiasco, and I do not use the word lightly. There were lengthy negotiations on the scheme itself and there are flock owners in Wexford who have been under notice since last October that their flocks were going to be culled, yet we saw no action on this until well after Christmas. There was an unseemly row in County Wexford over the weighing of sheep for the implementation of the scheme and now although the depopulation has been completed, or at least the first phase has been completed, payments have still not been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State inform me what arrangements are being made to have these payments made and say why payments have not been made up to now? Is the Minister of State at all <Col N="111" /> sensitive to the trauma and disturbance that has been suffered by flock owners and their families who have been living with this major problem and disruption of their activities since last October? Will the Minister of State assure me that these payments will be made immediately so we can put an end to this sorry episode?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív:</NameTxt>
      <P>Increased concern about TSEs generally, in particular because of the public health implications of BSE, and because of concerns about possible links between scrapie and BSE, has increased the focus at European level on the development of measures to establish the incidence of these diseases and eradicate them. When it comes to protecting its animal health status, Ireland has traditionally been proactive in the measures it has adopted. Its approach to dealing with BSE and, more recently, scrapie has been no different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have five minutes to speak and if the Deputy continues in this vein, the time will be up and he will not get the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, my Department has established a programme to control and eradicate scrapie and is implementing a policy which has three components. They are the depopulation of infected flocks, enhanced active surveillance for the disease and evaluation of genotyping. In relation to the depopulation element of this programme, all flocks which have had a case of scrapie since 1 January 1999 have been depopulated. Flocks with cases confirmed prior to 1 January 1999 will be examined on a case by case basis to determine whether similar action is required. This is necessary because scrapie is a disease of flocks, rather than of individual animals and is horizontally <Col N="112" /> transmissible, particularly at lambing time. This is borne out by the fact that of the flocks depopulated to date, 62% have had multiple cases of the disease. In one instance, a flock was found to have contained 29 scrapie positive sheep, including the animal which first tested positive in the flock. It is also the case that the scrapie agent has the capability of surviving on farms for a considerable period following depopulation and, for this reason, the flock owners concerned cannot restock with sheep for a period of two years following depopulation.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the information that is of interest to the Deputy. Against this background, my Department, following a series of negotiations with the IFA on behalf of affected farmers, agreed a framework for compensation of farmers whose flocks have been depopulated. This package includes payment for the capital value of the sheep depopulated on the basis of an agreed framework, payment of income support for the two years during which repopulation is not permitted and payment for the third year in which restocking can commence. In other words, one gets a capital sum as well as compensation for the income loss for three years.</P>
    <P>My Department has also agreed to consider any additional cost to the flock owner arising from the need to restock, subject to a technical assessment to determine the extent of such costs. The payments to which the Deputy refers in his question relate to the capital value of sheep slaughtered, as the first tranche of income support payments will not fall due until later in the year. In this regard, the present position is that of the 46 flocks slaughtered since 14 December 2001, 24 flock owners have been paid, nine claims have been processed and payment will issue in the very near future and the remaining 13 payments are being processed for payment. Of these 13 payments, the earliest depopulation was on 14 January, with the majority removed in late January or early February. Was it not worth the Deputy's while waiting for that?</P>
    <P>My Department has arranged for the payment, on account, of a portion of the sums due to these 13 flock owners and I expect the balance of the payments to be processed over the course of next week. There is good meat in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>I have kept the best to last. Is that not what is always done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite our best efforts, the intervention of the Christmas holiday period combined with the fact that this is a new scheme, the need for differentiation between different weights and categories of sheep for payment purposes and the need for receipt of extremely precise data from the slaughter plant, which must in turn be checked by <Col N="113" /> Department staff, caused the slowing up of the payment process. I am satisfied that matters are now moving more smoothly, as evidenced by the details I have given. They must not be telling the Deputy what is going on.</P>
    <P>It was intended from the very outset that certain features of the scheme would be reviewed at an early date and my Department will shortly be meeting the IFA for that purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this case on the Adjournment on 30 May last. I again draw the Minister's attention to it to support the appeal of the family of the late Dean Lyons to have the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into alleged Garda wrongdoing in County Donegal extended to include this matter. The Minister has already stated he does not wish to extend the tribunal's remit to include any other matter and has also said he does not have any evidence to warrant the establishment of a public inquiry into the Dean Lyons case.</P>
      <P>Despite this ongoing negative response, I put the following points to the Minister. Dean Lyons was charged with the horrific double murder of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan in March 1997. He made two statements of admission to the Garda while being interrogated, one of which was videotaped. We have been told repeatedly in the media, particularly by the respected security editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Jim Cusak, that information was contained in Dean Lyons's statement, made at the Bridewell Garda station, that could only have been known to the murderer and investigating gardaí. Mr. Cusak maintains that the report of an internal Garda inquiry confirms this. The question is, how did Dean Lyons, who had no involvement in the murders, include in his statement of admission details of which he could have no knowledge? The Minister will be aware that there have been other recent, high profile cases before the courts in which gardaí have been found to have interfered with statements made by accused persons. There have also been cases where persons have been convicted in the main on the basis of statements of admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, I put it to the Minister that he must accept that he is has the responsibility to establish if either statement of admission attributed to the late Dean Lyons was in any way interfered with by the investigating gardaí. That is something he has, to date, refused steadfastly to do. If there were specific details of the brutal murders of two defenceless women in the Dean Lyons statement &ndash; details of which he can have had no knowledge &ndash; the gardaí who recorded it must be called to account. If this was an isolated case, it would be bad enough, but in the context of recent cases, the details of which have been widely publicised, I must call <Col N="114" /> again on the Minister to have the facts brought into the open in order that the truth will be known. It is not sufficient or acceptable for him to hide behind the findings of the Garda Commissioner's own internal investigation, as he continues to do, even in reply to a parliamentary question of mine today. I ask him to appoint a member of the Judiciary to examine the statement of admission made by Dean Lyons and all other relevant documentation, including the reports of the internal Garda inquiries. All this could be done expeditiously at minimum financial cost. It is in the interests of public confidence in the Garda that it be done.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if Dean Lyons had been a person of influence and wealth, action would have been taken long ago to establish why he was charged with one of the most appalling murders in the history of the State. There can be little doubt that Dean Lyons's case has been swept under the official carpet because he was a homeless heroin addict, living rough in the centre of Dublin. The questions raised must be answered and changes must be introduced in Garda interrogation procedures, but also into the manner in which Garda malpractice is investigated, to prevent such a miscarriage of justice happening again.</P>

      <P>Tá's agam agus gheobhaidh an Teachta an freagra arís anois. The Minister has dealt with matters relating to this case in the House on a number of occasions, most recently in his reply to the Deputy's parliamentary Question No. 164 today and his more detailed reply to <Col N="115" /> parliamentary Question No. 11 on 21 February 2002.</P>
      <P>The relevant facts are as follows. In July 1997, Mr. Lyons made a full admission to investigating Garda officers of his alleged guilt in a double murder at Grangegorman on 10 March 1997 and this confession was recorded on audio-video tape. Later that same day he made a further detailed admission of his alleged involvement in the murders. This interview was not audio-visually recorded at Mr. Lyons's request.</P>
      <P>Following consultation between the Garda and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the person in question was charged with one of the murders at Grangegorman. Subsequently, another person first made and then retracted a confession in relation to the same murders. As a result, the Garda Commissioner appointed an Assistant Garda Commissioner to carry out an investigation into the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister was informed by the Garda authorities that this investigation indicated that Mr. Lyons did not commit the murders in question. This investigation also established that the manner in which Mr. Lyons had been interviewed in relation to the case was in compliance with the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997, which came into operation on 1 March 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Director of Public Prosecution decided that criminal proceedings against Mr. Lyons should be discon<Col N="116" /> tinued. Having considered the file submitted to him by the Garda in relation to the second individual who confessed to the murders, the DPP decided that no prosecution should take place. As the House will be aware, the DPP is independent in the exercise of his functions and it would not be appropriate to comment on his decisions.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the family of Mr. Lyons, through Deputy Gregory, suggests that this case should be referred to the tribunal of inquiry which will be established to look into and determine the truth of certain allegations made in relation to Garda activities in the Donegal division. I do not need to rehearse in this House the background to the establishment of the proposed tribunal, but it relates to a specific set of circumstances. While the terms of reference of the tribunal have not yet been finalised, the Minister is not disposed towards extending its remit to deal with the case of the late Mr. Lyons or any other matter which has no bearing or relevance to what happened in Donegal. The House will be aware that the terms of reference of this tribunal will be debated in the House in the near future. In addition, the Minister believes that he does not have any evidence available to him which would warrant the holding of an independent inquiry into this case.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 March 2002.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases in which the European Commission has initiated legal action or announced that it intends to take legal action, arising from the failure to implement EU directives for which his Department has responsibility; the steps he is taking to ensure that all of these directives are implemented in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently four cases in respect of which the European Commission has initiated legal action.</P>
      <P>The first case concerns water quality in certain private rural water supplies. My Department is actively pursuing an intensive programme of measures to improve these supplies and achieve high water quality.</P>
      <P>The second concerns the designation of vulnerable zones under the nitrates directive. Ireland has substantively complied with the main provisions of the directive in that we have undertaken the necessary monitoring of water quality, published a code of good agricultural practice, and put in place a wide range of measures to protect water quality from agricultural pollution. Proposals are now being developed for regulations to provide a statutory basis for the application in all areas of established standards of good farming practice. These will give further effect to a number of EU directives on waste and water quality, including the nitrates directive.</P>
      <P>The third case concerns non-compliance with Articles 4 and 11 of the directive on polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls, PCB-PCT, which require Ireland to prepare inventories and a plan for decontamination-disposal of PCB contaminated equipment and PCBs contained therein. The EPA's national hazardous waste management plan largely addresses the requirements of the directive. In addition the EPA has prepared a draft national PCB holdings plan which when completed will facilitate identification and management of PCB holdings.</P>
      <P>The fourth case relates to a number of complaints made to the Commission concerning the carrying on of waste activities allegedly without appropriate authorisation as well as delays in EPA licensing. Ireland is required to lodge its defence by 10 April 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission has announced its intention to take legal action, but no formal notice has issued, in three other cases, in relation to the directives on dangerous substances, quality of <Col N="118" /> shellfish waters and roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the dangerous substances directive water quality standards have been established for phosphorous and 14 other substances. However EPA monitoring indicates that dangerous substances other than phosphorous are not a problem in Irish waters generally.</P>
    <P>Regulations have been made to complete the transposition of the quality of shellfish waters directive into Irish law; responsibility for the implementation of the regulations is a matter for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>Full practical effect has been given to the roadworthiness tests directive since June 2001 and draft regulations providing for transposition of the directive are close to finalisation.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulation EC 2037/2000 requires the recovery and destruction of ozone depleting substances contained in domestic refrigerators and freezers from 1 January 2002. In addition, European Commission Decision 2000/532/EC revised the EU list of hazardous waste to include, with effect from 1 January 2002, equipment which contains CFCs. These changes affect the disposal of fridges and freezers manufactured before 1994 which contain CFCs in insulating foam as well as in fridge coolant. While technology is available in Ireland for the removal of CFCs from the coolants in fridges and freezers, no equipment is yet available for the removal of the insulating foam.</P>
      <P>The effect of these two instruments is that with effect from 1 January 2002 fridges and freezers cannot be dealt with by the traditional method of degassing, recovering the metal and sending the remaining waste to landfill. I understand that in the absence of treatment facilities in Ireland  &ndash; a problem also being experienced in other EU member states &ndash; a number of local authorities have made arrangements for the storage of fridges and freezers or for their export to appropriate recovery facilities in mainland Europe; such arrangements may involve cooperation with private waste companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the issue continues to be examined by my Department with a view to establishing longer term solutions to this matter. Officials from my Department are also in discussion with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to see whether an all-island <Col N="119" /> solution to the problem, with potentially better economies of scale, is feasible.</P>

      <P>The selection of appropriate heating systems for installation in new local authority housing is a matter for the relevant local authority. My Department issued guidelines in relation to the design of social housing to all local authorities in 1999. The guidelines advised local authorities to take account of a number of factors when determining the most appropriate heating system in their houses. These include the expected capital and running costs, servicing and maintenance costs and the preferences of likely occupants. Local authorities were also asked to have regard to aspects such as efficiency in use, ease of operation and expected emissions of smoke, CO2 and other harmful emissions.</P>
      <P>The guidelines also recommend that, where natural gas is available on site, it should generally be the preferred fuel for space and water heating. In addition, local authorities were asked to consider alternatives such as solar panels or other renewable energy technology, where economical and practicable.</P>
      <P>In relation to smoke control areas, local authorities were requested to ensure that open fire and other solid fuel appliances used in such areas are capable of burning smokeless fuels. I am not aware of local authorities failing to follow this guidance.</P>

      <P>Good progress is being maintained with the development of the national roads network as mandated in the national development plan, including the advancement of the five major inter-urban routes.</P>
      <P>The NDP provides for investment of &euro;5.59 billion, at 1999 prices, in national road improvements over the period 2000-2006. This represents a threefold increase on the 1994-1999 period. The NDP also sets out a strategic framework for the development of the national roads network over the plan period.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the NRA, within the NDP framework, to promote detailed programming of the work required and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total 2002 provision for the national roads improvement programme is &euro;958 million. This represents an increase of &euro;50 million on the 2001 out-turn, is more than three times the 1997 level of expenditure and nearly twice that of 1999. The investment of nearly &euro;2.5 billion which will have been made in national road improvements for the first three years of the NDP, which is to end 2002, <Col N="121" /> is already more than &euro;260 million, or some 10%, in excess of the planned NDP profile.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, some 60 major projects on the national road network have either been completed or are under way and 15 new projects were opened to traffic in 1991 alone. The NRA programme will see over 20 projects being taken forward during 2002 including the M50 Dublin Port Tunnel, south eastern motorway, new sections of motorway on the M1 between Dublin Airport and the Balbriggan by-pass and the Drogheda by-pass, N5 Strokestown-Longford, N7 Kildare by-pass, N7 Limerick southern ring road, phase 1, N11 Rathnew-Ashford by-pass, N17 Knock Claremorris, N18 Newmarket-on-Fergus by-pass, N22 Ballincollig by-pass and N25 Youghal by-pass.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I have already taken issue with the recent Construction Industry Federation analysis of the NDP national roads programme, which in my view is unrealistic in not recognising the major progress now being made in national road construction, despite more difficult economic conditions.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to the strong and accelerated promotion of the NDP national roads programme and the pace and volume of the programme in 2002 reflect this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 20 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's national climate change strategy, which I published in November 2000, sets a ten-year framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto protocol. I will bring a motion before the House shortly seeking approval to the terms of the protocol in order that Ireland may ratify it, together with all other member states and the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the national climate change strategy is being co-ordinated by a cross-departmental climate change team, chaired by my Department, which has met 15 times since January 2001. Work is under way on the development of a long-term communications strategy addressing awareness of climate change, and Comhar has prepared proposals for this. The team has established necessary consultative arrangements and <Col N="122" /> will develop a robust set of indicators at sectoral and national level, oversee the quantification of costs and benefits of implementing specific measures, and undertake the biennial review of the strategy, beginning in 2002, in consultation with Comhar. The team is finalising a progress report on implementation of the strategy which I intend to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, since August 2001, regulations require all new passenger cars for sale to be individually labelled with fuel economy and CO2 emissions. This measure is expected to reduce emissions by 380,000 tonnes CO2 per annum by 2010.</P>
    <P>I also published consultation documents on the revision of Part L of the national building regulations in September 2001, relating to the conservation of fuel and energy, which bring forward the operative date for improved standards from 2005 to 2002. The new standards are estimated to reduce requirements for space and water heating by 23% to 33%, depending on the type and size of the dwelling, and, on current patterns of fuel use, a reduction of 300,000 tonnes CO2 per annum for 2012 is anticipated.</P>
    <P>With regard to traffic management, in 2002, approximately &euro;40 million is being provided to the Dublin Transportation Office in respect of traffic management grants, an increase of almost 20% on last year's provision. The year 2001 saw the launch of five new QBCs, with work continuing on further routes. Significant infrastructural provision for cycling is under way, including strategic cycleways and cycle parking spaces. Overall, implementation of the DTO strategy for the greater Dublin area, A Platform for Change, will reduce emissions by over 1 Mt of CO2 per annum by 2016, a 41% reduction on projected emissions.</P>
    <P>Other key measures being advanced by my colleagues in Government include: the significant expansion of renewable energy, with an additional 370 MW under the AER V competition; approval of the first offshore windfarm, with a planned capacity of 520 MW; &euro;3 billion investment in public transport under the NDP and; afforestation grants and premium rates were increased by 30% from January 2000.</P>
    <P>Emissions of greenhouse gases in 1999 were 20.4% above 1990 levels. Preliminary data prepared by the EPA and subject to finalisation following complete analysis indicate a further increase in emissions. I am satisfied that full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade will ensure that our Kyoto obligations will be fully met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has recently agreed to my proposals for the use of the electronic voting and vote counting system in the constituencies of Dublin North, Dublin West and Meath at the forthcoming general election, subject to satisfactory final testing of the software involved. The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, provides for the possibility of such voting subject to a ministerial order which I intend to make in relation to the arrangements now envisaged. The system comprises a voting machine and election management and PR-STV count software. The elections in the three constituencies will be conducted by the respective returning officers.</P>
      <P>Voters will register in the normal way at the polling station and will then record their preferences on a ballot paper displayed on a voting machine by pressing the space beside the candidate's photograph. This replaces the practice of marking the ballot paper with a pencil. When the voter is satisfied with the preferences, he or she presses the Cast Vote button. The votes will be securely stored in vote modules, which will be brought to the count centre after the close of the poll. The votes will be counted electronically using the PR-STV count software and results should be available within two hours of the last vote module being received.</P>
      <P>While the system is simple to use, an information campaign will be undertaken in each of the three constituencies. This will involve the distribution of an information leaflet to each registered elector, a poster campaign, local radio advertising, a travelling roadshow with the voting machine and a number of other measures. In addition, training of returning officers and their election staff will be undertaken in the run up to the polls.</P>
      <P>The system has undergone extensive testing, including independent testing of the voting machine in Germany and Holland and an architectural and code review of the software by an Irish company. The Department and a number of returning officers have tested the voting machines for functionality and the count software has been similarly tested for functionality and accuracy in the implementation of the count rules. However, in the event of difficulties arising on polling day, there will be a range of back-up measures in operation depending on the particular difficulty that may arise. These include the use of spare voting machines should a machine malfunction; battery back-up in the event of a power failure; the availability of a back-up vote module should the original be mislaid in transit to the count centre and comprehensive technical support from the company.</P>

The Bill, which will be published shortly, will provide that non-party candidates at European, Dáil, and local elections will be required to obtain the signatures of 60, 30 and 15 respectively registered electors in the constituency or local electoral area, as assentors to the nomination. Candidates who are nominated by a registered political party and who have a certificate of political affiliation from their political party will not have to obtain signatures on their nomination papers.

      <P>The EU directives relevant to this matter are Directive 91/671/EEC of 16 December 1991 on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to compulsory use of safety belts in vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes and Directive 96/36/EC of 17 June 1996 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 77/541/EEC relating to safety belts and restraint systems of motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 91/671/EEC has been fully transposed into Irish law. As a consequence, passenger vehicles with up to eight seats are required to have seatbelts fitted for each seat and these must <Col N="125" /> be used by the seat occupants. In the case of larger passenger vehicles and goods vehicles with a maximum weight of 3,500 kilograms, the requirements apply to the driver and a passenger in a forward facing front seat only.</P>
    <P>EU Directive 96/36/EC provides the option for member states to require that all seating positions in new passenger vehicles with seating for more than eight persons, excluding the driver, are fitted with seat belts; vehicles designed to accommodate standing passengers are excluded. The question of how best to implement Directive 96/36/EC in respect of large passenger vehicles in general is being addressed in parallel with the development of proposals for the enhancement of school bus safety.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to issue specific guidelines to local authorities in relation to the need for land reservation adjacent to rail tracks. Land is reserved for infrastructure through the relevant planning authority development plan. Under section 10 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, each planning authority is required to include objectives in its development plan to secure the provision or the facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including transport.</P>
      <P>In addition, the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, published on 25 March 1999, set out an integrated land use framework for the sustainable development of the greater Dublin area, comprising the Dublin and mid-east regions. This is designed <i>inter alia</i> to improve the balance between public and private transport. Statutory recognition for the strategic planning guidelines is provided in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The relevant provisions came into force on 1 January 2001 and require planning authorities in the greater Dublin area to have regard to the guidelines when making and adopting a development plan.</P>
      <P>The DTO strategy, A Platform for Change, which updates the original DTI strategy and has a horizon to 2016 has been prepared to support and complement the framework set out in the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area.</P>

      <P>The Government's efforts in support of housing have prioritised adaptation-strengthening of institutions and structures, increasing the funding of housing programmes and redesign of incentives-supports so as to secure the required levels of housing output across all tenures. In relation to strengthening the structures, we have developed a range of administrative arrangements and new initiatives, including: an enhanced role and additional resourcing for the housing unit; the establishment of the voluntary housing and housing supply units in my Department; the setting up of a cross departmental team on housing; the setting up of the housing forum in agreement with the social partners as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; and the establishment of the private residential tenancies board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis pending the necessary legislation arising from the recommendations of the commission on the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>Our approach has delivered consistently higher levels of overall housing output and a major expansion of both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes. Total housing output last year, at more than 52,000 units, was the highest output ever achieved in a single year. In addition, local authority output was at the highest level for 15 years and the voluntary housing sector achieved its highest output ever.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, all planning authorities prepared their housing strategies by the statutory deadline of end July 2001. All development plans, with the exception of those of Buncrana and Nenagh Town Councils and Wexford Borough Council, have been varied to include the housing strategies.</P>
      <P>The majority of the 33 strategies provide for the full 20% maximum provision for social and affordable housing. Kilkenny provides for 18.7%, Laois for 17.5% and the remaining five &ndash; Cavan, Donegal, Fingal, Offaly and South Dublin County Councils &ndash; provide for 15%. Just over half of the strategies specify a split between social and affordable housing. The strategies set out the full range of options available for the provision of social and affordable housing viz. the Multi-Annual Local Authority Housing Programme 2000-2003, casual vacancies, the current affordable housing scheme, the shared ownership scheme, the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, housing provided under Part V, private sites, and public private partnerships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are now mobilising their housing strategies and I am aware that some authorities have recently placed advertisements in the local press inviting people to apply for inclusion in affordable housing schemes under Part V. Potential eligible first time buyers are <Col N="132" /> advised to register with their local authority to ensure that they are considered for affordable housing. The social and affordable housing requirement applies to all relevant residential planning permission applications made after the development plan has been amended to take account of the housing strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>The levy on plastic shopping bags &ndash; which is due to take effect from 4 March 2002 &ndash; will not apply to plastic primary packaging, in the form of bags or otherwise, containing goods or products, regardless of size or contents. Plastic sacks containing farm products are therefore excluded from the levy.</P>
      <P>Apart from the new levy, measures are required to provide for the return and-or collection of used packaging, and for the reuse or recovery &ndash; including recycling &ndash; of the packaging waste collected, to assist in meeting packaging waste recovery and recycling targets. In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, initiatives already operate in Ireland in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste. Repak in the case of packaging waste and Irish farm films producers group in the case of farm plastics, for example, bale wrap. In these cases, producers are required to take steps to recover waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question.</P>
      <P>My Department will keep the use of plastic packaging in the agricultural and other sectors under review, and will consider whether further arrangements are required to improve its collection and recovery. I have no immediate plans, however, to extend the plastic bags levy in this regard.</P>

      <P>Information available from the 1999 assessment of housing need indicates that, at that time, more than two thirds of households assessed as in need of local authority housing were on the local authority waiting list for less than two years. It is, however, the case that some applicants for local authority housing are on waiting lists for longer periods on the basis that their housing need has a relative lower priority compared with the needs of households who have been allocated housing. The relative priority of households on the local authority waiting lists is determined in accordance with the authorities scheme of letting priorities, the making of which is a function reserved to the elected members.</P>
      <P>The next statutory assessment of housing needs is to be undertaken by local authorities at the end of next month. In undertaking the assessment, my Department has asked all local authorities to undertake an age analysis of waiting lists to establish more detailed information on the length of time applicants are waiting on housing lists and it is my intention to publish this information with the results of the assessment.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 15 cent levy on plastic bags, as provided for in the Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations, 2001, which is due to take effect on Monday 4 March, will apply to all plastic bags supplied to customers at the point of sale to them of goods or products to be placed in the bags in any shop, supermarket, service station or other sales outlet. There is an exemption for bags used for non-packaged fresh food products, fish, meat, poultry, fruit and vegetables, etc. The dimensions of these bags must not exceed 225mm in width exclusive of any gussets, by 345mm in depth inclusive of any gussets, by 450mm in length inclusive of any handles. Plastic bags designed for reuse and which are sold to customers for a sum <Col N="135" /> of not less than 70 cent are also exempt as are bags provided to departing passengers in ports or airports, and on board ships or aircraft. The levy will not apply to plastic primary packaging, in the form of bags or otherwise, containing goods or products, regardless of size or contents.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are the responsible authority for enforcing the collection of the levy. In addition, the regulations impose a supplementary requirement on retailers to pass on the full amount of the levy to customers, and this regulatory provision will be enforced by local authorities. The relevant enforcement officers will have extensive powers to enter any retail premises, to conduct any searches or investigations considered necessary, and to inspect or remove any records, books and documents for the purposes of any proceedings in relation to the levy.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners and the local authorities will have the necessary powers &ndash; equivalent to those available in respect of the implementation and enforcement of relevant taxation and other waste management measures &ndash; to ensure that the levy can be successfully applied and that any efforts to evade liability can be detected.</P>
      <P>It is conservatively estimated that some 1.2 billion plastic shopping bags are provided free of charge to customers in Ireland each year. However, the primary purpose of the levy is not to generate revenue &ndash; it is to change consumer behaviour and achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of plastic bags dispensed at retail outlets. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate at this stage what funds will be generated by the levy.</P>
      <P>The proceeds from the levy, together with the proposed levy on land filling, will accrue to a dedicated environment fund. Proceeds from the environment fund may be used to support a wide range of waste management, litter and other environmental initiatives as set out in section 74(9) of the Waste Management Act, 1996, as inserted by section 12 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 293 and 300 of 26 February 2002. The Government has appointed three independent persons, Mr. Kevin Bonner, Mr. Bill Attley and Ms Ann Riordan to form a taxi hardship panel. The panel has been asked to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime on 21 November 2000, including an estimate of the numbers of individual licence holders involved, the likely financial implications and the recommended criteria for assessment of extreme personal financial hardship under any subsequent proposed response by Government. The report of the findings of the panel will then be presented to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has received no information from the Garda authorities or Dublin City Council to suggest that the level of complaints about taxi drivers in Dublin has doubled. Standards and requirements for applicants for the licensing of taxi and hackney drivers continue, as adminis<Col N="138" /> tered by the gardaí, on the same basis as prior to liberalisation.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the publication of a consultation paper prepared by my Department relating to the development of qualitative improvements in taxi services and advertisements inviting submissions from all interested parties by 30 April 2002 were placed in the national newspapers on 12 February 2002. The consultation paper has been prepared against the background of the liberalised regime of taxi licensing, the provisions of the Disability Bill and the stated policy that, by end 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the paper is to set out the general framework and focus for a review of the relevant elements of the public service vehicle regulations for the purpose of supporting the overall process. The review will encompass: consideration of the regulation of taxi services including the standards to be applied to taxi vehicles in the future; the licensing arrangements to be applied to taxi drivers and the operators of taxi services; the provision of services at particular times of the day; how best to secure a high quality cost effective taxi service which meets a wide range of needs including those of disabled passengers.</P>
    <P>The merits of the rationalisation of the current regulatory regime and the roles of various State and local bodies will also be considered in the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>The number of road deaths in 2000 and 2001 was 415 and 411 respectively. The total for 2001 represents a 13% decrease on the 1997 level of 472. There were 1,640 serious injuries on our roads in 2000 representing a decrease of almost 25% on 1997 levels. Figures relating to serious injuries for 2001 are not yet fully analysed and authenticated. They will be set out in the Road Accident Facts, 2001, which will be published by the National Roads Authority later this year.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly pursuing the implementation of its strategy for road safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Government. The strategy has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report &ndash; July 1999, second progress report &ndash; August 2000, and third progress report &ndash; July 2001 &ndash; detail progress with key actions. Copies of all three reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. In addition to the reduced level of road <Col N="140" /> deaths and serious injuries to which I have already referred, the interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been well met.</P>
    <P>Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 365 schemes completed on the national network by end 2001 with a further 32 approved for 2002. On the other hand, recent NRA surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reducing speeding and increasing seat belt wearing.</P>
    <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. Over 345,000 on the spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 2001, compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. A pilot scheme providing for the deployment of fixed speed cameras is in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2001, approximately 149,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. The number of detections for drink driving in 2001 increased by almost 53% over 1998. Evidential breath testing was on target by end of 2001 with 40 instruments in operation.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy also provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was published in March 2001 and passed Committee Stage in the Dáil last week. Report Stage is due to commence shortly. The necessary software amendments to the national driver file to record penalty points and administer the system have been made.</P>
    <P>Ensuring compliance with the targets of the road safety strategy will command the full effort and support of the Government and its agencies. By reference to the estimates set out in the strategy in 1998, over 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998.</P>

      <P>The terms of contracts between main contractors and sub-contrac<Col N="141" /> tors are primarily the responsibility of the parties to the contract. However, I understand that most such contracts contain a standard arbitration clause.</P>
      <P>The report of the strategic review committee on the construction industry recommended that a mandatory and binding alternative dispute resolution mechanism, which would be quicker and cheaper than formal arbitration should be provided for in all construction contracts.</P>
      <P>The forum for the construction industry plans to introduce, by mid-year, a new standard form of contract between clients and main contractors for civil engineering projects, which will include a mandatory and binding conciliation clause. Under this clause, both parties to a dispute would have to invoke a conciliation procedure, prior to invoking arbitration. The conciliator's finding will be binding on both parties, unless and until it is changed at arbitration. The forum hopes that both parties to the contract will generally accept the conciliator's findings and will seldom, if ever, invoke arbitration.</P>
      <P>I understand that, if this new standard form of contract is agreed and adopted, it will then serve as a model for the development, by the forum, of a new standard form of contract between main contractors and sub-contractors.</P>

      <P>We are very much aware of the substantial increases in insurance premiums that many firms are facing and of the problems this is creating for them. The pricing and underwriting of insurance is, however, a matter for individual insurance companies. EU law prevents us from intervening in relation to the matter of premium levels or in respect of what risks they are prepared to underwrite. Insurers make decisions on provision of cover based on their assessment of that particular risk.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry has pointed to a number of factors, both domestic and international, to explain these increases. These include the high cost of settling claims, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions regarding the calculation of compensation losses in personal injury cases and the affects of the 11 September attacks in the United States. The situation has not been helped by the failure of the UK authorised insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, which had a significant presence in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>Increases in insurance costs may be a contributory factor in the trading difficulties being experienced by some businesses at present but there may be other factors specific to particular cases. I encourage consumers and insurers to consider ways of reducing the worst effects of the current circumstances, for example by better management of risks, examination of excess covers and whether the full extent of the covers included in policies is actually required.</P>

      <P>The Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in trade disputes, such as disputes relating to non-statutory redundancy payments. In such cases, the court hears both sides and then issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled. A hearing in relation to the dispute concerning redundancy payments for those affected by the closure of Peerless Rugs, Athy took place on 9 July 2001, following which the court issued its recommendations. While the recommendations of the Labour Court are not binding on the parties concerned, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the court's recommendations. However, responsibility for the settlement of a dispute ultimately rests with the parties themselves. At present there are no plans to make recommendations of the Labour Court in industrial relations disputes legally enforceable.</P>

      <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-2001, all claims received by my Department in respect of entitlement to statutory redundancy payments have been paid to former employees of Irish Ispat Limited. The total paid to date under the scheme is &euro;2,010,629.33. Under the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-2001, the amount owed to the Social Insurance Fund by the company is &euro;804,251.73 and this amount will rank as a preferential claim against any assets in the final winding up of the liquidation proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the insolvency payments scheme, all claims received, with the exception of one on query, in respect of outstanding pay related employee entitlements have been paid under the terms of the scheme. The amounts paid cover wages, holiday pay, minimum notice compensation and some pension contributions claims received to date. The total paid to date under the scheme is &euro;1,548,986.41. Under the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 2001, the total amount paid will rank as a preferential claim against any <Col N="144" /> assets in the final winding up of the liquidation proceedings of the company.</P>
    <P>My Department has also paid matching funds of &euro;3,000 per employee in relation to an application to the European Commission for re-adaptation aid under Article 56(2)(<i>b</i>) of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty. A total amount of &euro;1.362 million has been paid to date in matching funds which also includes payments of matching funds to some permanent on site contract workers. Under this scheme, the State is required to provide the matching funds and these funds are not recoupable.</P>
    <P>At the time of the closure of the company, a State guaranteed loan which had been taken out by the former Irish Steel in 1993 from ACC Bank was still in place. This loan had been due for repayment in 2003 but on liquidation of the company the full amount outstanding became payable. The State has paid the ACC Bank an amount of IR£8.37 million in settlement of their claim under the guarantee. As part of the State aid package at the time of the sale, the State had deposited IR£4.617 million in a joint Escrow account with Ispat on condition that this was to be held on deposit until both the ACC loan and another State guaranteed loan were re-paid. The other State guaranteed loan was repaid by Ispat in 1999. Also a letter of credit for IR£4 million was put in place by Ispat as counter-cover for the guaranteed loans. The State is currently in the process of recouping the amount paid to the ACC Bank from funds in the Escrow account and from the letter of credit and it is expected that the amount paid by the State on foot of the guarantee will be fully recouped in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 60 and 62 dealing with employers' insurance together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for insurance companies themselves. EU <Col N="145" /> law prevents us from intervening in the pricing or underwriting of insurance. Thus, we have no information about premium trends in the past five years. We are aware that premiums have increased in 2001 and 2002. Insurers have attributed these increases to the high cost of settling claims in Ireland, the general reduction in investment returns, recent court decisions that necessitate increased claims reserves and costs to reinsurers of the events of 11 September last. While employer liability insurance is not compulsory in Ireland, the award of State and local authority contracts is dependant on the tenderer having appropriate insurance cover. While there is no authoritative information on the number of employed covered by employers' liability insurance, a report published by IBEC in March 2001 contains a survey indicating that 89% of companies were covered either by commercial or self-insurance.</P>
    <P>While successive reports indicate that employers' liability insurance costs are higher in Ireland than in other member states, this may be attributable to the differences in social provision between Ireland and other EU member states. In many EU countries medical expenses and loss of earnings are largely, if not totally, provided for by the state. Where such arrangements are in place, they may operate through partial recoverability against employers, but they do have implications in relation to the level of taxes on employment.</P>

      <P>We are aware that in the United Kingdom, employers' liability compulsory insurance legislation is in place. As regards other EU countries, the position is somewhat more complex. The Deloitte &amp; Touche Management Consultants Report on Insurance Costs in Ireland (1996) stated that the continental countries differ so much from Ireland and the UK, in these respects, that it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons. While this reference is to comparisons of premium levels, the report pointed out that in some EU countries medical expenses are largely, or even totally, provided for by the state. Where such arrangements are in place, it seems that they may operate through partial recoverability against employers, but they do have implications in relation to the level of taxes on employment.</P>

      <P>The Technology Foresight Ireland report commissioned by the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, ICSTI, in 1999 identified the falling numbers taking physics and chemistry as &ldquo;potentially the biggest long-term threat to Ireland's ability to develop as a knowledge-based society&rdquo;. The expert group on future skills needs, established by Forfás, has been monitoring the supply and demand position for skilled personnel in a number of industrial sectors. Its most recent report stated that there are skills shortages in some areas, including computer scientists and technologists for the information technology sector and graduates for the pharmaceutical and chemicals sectors. The expert group is of the opinion that growth in the high technology business sectors will increase the overall demand of science and engineering graduates. The expert group drew attention to the increased funding being made available through Science Foundation Ireland and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to support advanced research. This will have the effect of increasing the need for researchers with a PhD qualification and the expert group recommended that national policy should aim to increase substantially the output of doctorates, particularly in science and engineering.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for coast protection works rest with the property owner, whether that is a private individual or a local authority. Cork County Council has submitted <Col N="148" /> proposals in relation to coast protection works at the Warren Strand for consideration by my Department. The county council has not communicated with my Department concerning further damage caused at the Warren Strand by the recent storms. I have approved the granting of a foreshore lease to Cork County Council to enable coast protection works to be carried out at the Warren. Cork County Council requested an amendment to the terms of the lease and this is the subject of ongoing discussions between the council and the Chief State Solicitor. It is expected this matter will be resolved shortly. The question of funding coast protection works at the Warren Strand is being given priority by my Department.</P>

      <P>There had been no across the board increase in CIE single standard fares between September 1991 and January 2000, although a number of fares were increased in 1994.</P>
      <P>In December 1999 the Government conveyed sanction for Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath to implement the fare increases, as set out in the attached tables, in respect of standard single journey passenger fares from I January 2000. Although there had been no increase since 1991 and 1994, the changes in the consumer price index since those two dates were 17.9% and 10.3%, respectively. While the CIE group of companies had sought increasingly to reduce its costs through restructuring plans, payroll and other operating costs continued to increase significantly over the period. Also, the increase in fares allowed the companies to contribute towards the cost of the major investment programme in public transport infrastructure as set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals in relation to the development of the three State airports, including Cork Airport, are in the first instance a matter for Aer Rianta, which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers. Aer Rianta informs me that the development programme for Cork Airport consists of a terminal building with capacity for three million passengers per annum, a multi-storey carpark with covered access to the terminal, air-bridges, the provision of hold baggage screening facilities and a control tower which will be equipped by the Irish Aviation Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company also informs me that consultants are currently preparing the detailed design which is planned to be ready to go to tender in May. Based on this timing for tendering and evaluation, the placing of the contract is likely to be completed in August-September with work <Col N="153" /> expected to commence in September-October of this year. This major development programme at Cork Airport, which will cost in excess of &euro;100 million, will take about two years to complete and the new facilities are expected to be operational early in 2005.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the case of ex-servicemen who left the Defence Forces prior to 1990 who have not been paid the full military service allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>This question refers to the issue of having military service allowance, MSA, included in the calculation of the pensions of pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 46 on 13 February 2002, the position is that, arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces &ndash; the Gleeson commission &ndash; MSA, which had been introduced in 1979, was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the MSA, and the consequences for pensioners generally in its final report which was published in January 2001. However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long-standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised in the context of the Government's consideration of the commission's final report.</P>
      <P>The commission, whose report is the first comprehensive examination of public service pension arrangements since the foundation of the State, was an independent body. It had invited submissions from interested parties through an advertisement in the national press in September 1996 and I understand that groups representative of military pensioners were among those who made submissions and were met by the commission.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 29 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. An advance payment for 27 animals issued on 16 November 2001. In processing the application for payment a number of checks are carried out against the CMMS database records. It was found that animal tag number NEA971897 was not on the applicant's herd profile and there was no record of the animal being moved onto his holding. Further clarification was required regarding movement details for this animal and the applicant was advised to contact the mart regarding this matter. A problem also arose regarding animal tag number POA637114, which was not registered with SWS Bandon and this matter, has since been resolved. Issue of balancing payments commenced on 31 January 2002.</P>
      <P>A re-examination of the application showed that three animals, tag numbers UEA411415, UIA158457 and UIA740635, were disposed of before the end of the six months retention period and were not replaced in accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme. The herdowner has been contacted regarding this matter and his application will be processed further on receipt of his reply.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted a special beef premium application in respect of seven animals on 12 June 2001. The 80% advance payment in respect of four animals issued on 31 October 2001. Payment will issue in respect of the remaining three animals when details of the movement of these animals have been input onto the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS.</P>

      <P>The last survey was carried out in 1989 and was the basis for the selection of areas for reclassification in 1991. The survey was conducted from a random sample of farms in each townland. The rate of sampling varied from townland to townland but the overall selection was 57% across the whole surveyed area. Data from the survey on the areas and numbers of animals, etc., can only be supplied on receipt of the written consent of the farmers concerned. I have no plans to carry out a review of disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 277 of 30 January 2002, one of the parcels claimed by the person named in his 2001 area aid application overlapped with a parcel of land claimed by another applicant. Following contact by my Department with both herdowners, the problem was resolved in favour of the person named. His area aid application has now been fully processed with no outstanding errors. The other herdowner in this case has not received any overpayments in respect of 2001 area aid related schemes.</P>
      <P>The person named has made one application for special beef premium 2001 in respect of one animal, and payment will issue within the next two weeks now that the area aid details have been finalised.</P>
      <P>The person named also applied for premium for ten animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. The application has been processed to payment stage and his 100% entitlement will issue as soon as possible. His entitlement under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowances scheme will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for premium for 17 animals under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme. It was found at an on-farm inspection that two animals, tag Nos. CNA565643 and TJCJ0017K, were not recorded on the herd register of bovine animals. It is a requirement under clause 27(<i>b</i>) of the terms and conditions of the scheme that each producer must maintain and keep up to date in the official herd register of bovine animals, accurate and full records of all animals in the herd. A formal notification issued to the applicant informing him that the two non-compliant animals on his suckler cow claim were being rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to non-claimed animals, 11 animals were omitted from the herd register, seven had no passports and one had lost both ear tags. As <Col N="157" /> the level of non-compliance with identification and registration was found to be greater than 20% no aid is payable under 2001 suckler cow or extensification schemes. The person named has since appealed this decision. The person named will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Disabled Drivers' and Disabled Passengers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 provide for repayment of excise duty on fuel used in a vehicle which has qualified under the Regulations, up to an annual maximum of 600 gallons, 2,728 litres. There is no provision for repayment of VAT. The value of the maximum relief available under the Regulations would amount, at current rates of excise duty, to &euro;1,095 per annum in respect of petrol and &euro;825 per annum in respect of diesel. It should be noted that this relief is allowed only in respect of fuel actually used in the course of the transportation of the person with the disability and that fuel used while the vehicle is being used for other purposes does not qualify for the relief. Applications for repayment are required to be supported by appropriate sales documentation <Col N="158" /> and are, of course, subject to audit in the normal way.</P>
      <P>No changes have been made in relation to the provisions governing the fuel repayment scheme since its implementation in 1994. However, the rates of excise duty in respect of unleaded petrol and diesel were reduced in the 2001 Budget, by 2p and 6p per litre respectively, and this would have been reflected in the value of excise refunds during 2001. The relevant figures for the last 3 years are shown in the following table:</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>We have received correspondence from the individual. He has put forward three proposals in respect of the VAT treatment of hairdressing &ndash; to reduce VAT on hairdressing to zero, increase registration thresholds to &euro;63,486.90, or abolish registration thresholds. Under the EU sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates. Since hairdressing was not at a zero rate on 1 January, 1991 I cannot exclude hairdressing from being liable for VAT. The registration thresholds for VAT were last increased in 1994 and are currently &euro;25,500 for services and &euro;51,000 for goods. Ireland has the second highest registration threshold for goods and services in the EU and some member states have no registration threshold for goods and services and require all taxable persons to register irrespective of their turnover.</P>
      <P>EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, determines the rules in respect of any change in the thresholds. This requires that it is possible to increase the thresholds but only in line with maintaining their real value. In effect therefore it would only be possible to increase the threshold to &euro;30,000 for services and &euro;60,000 for goods. Any increases beyond that amount would require EU approval. It would not be possible to increase the thresholds for hairdressing salons only. Any increase in the thresholds would have to apply to all taxable persons. Any change in the thresholds would have a significant Exchequer cost. Although the Directive provides for the option to introduce or increase thresholds, it does not explicitly provide for the removal of thresholds that are already in existence. It would be possible to abolish existing registration thresholds. However, the existence of the thresholds allows for certain small businesses to remain outside the VAT net, to help small new businesses develop and to avoid the administrative difficulties and cost for the Exchequer of including a wide range of small businesses in the VAT system. Therefore, I have no plans to increase or abolish the existing registration thresholds.</P>

      <Quest>if there is a concession available to a person whose income increases by a given amount with the effect that he is 95 cents per week above the threshold for payment of the health levy and resulting in a substantial net loss to the person; if not, his plans to amend legislation to eradicate this discrepancy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no concession available to the category of income <Col N="160" /> earner mentioned by the Deputy to address what is known as the &ldquo;step&rdquo; effect which is experienced by such persons when their incomes increase to just above the health levy threshold. The health contribution levy is charged at a rate of 2% with only a few exceptions, e.g. social welfare payments, including social welfare pensions. The 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levy of &euro;11,428, £9,000, per annum which meant that where a person's income was lower than the threshold he/she was not liable for the health contribution. However, when a person's income rises above the threshold, the levy is payable on the person's total income from the first cent of that income.</P>
      <P>From 6 April 2000, the health contribution threshold was substantially increased by &euro;4,203, £3,310, from &euro;14,285, £11,250 per annum to &euro;18,488, £14,560 per annum, or from &euro;276, £217 per week to &euro;355, £280 per week. This significant increase has exempted even more low income earners from the health contribution. Because of this sizeable increase in the threshold for the levy I decided not to increase it further in the past two budgets. The levy threshold was introduced in order to focus assistance towards those on low incomes. The Government was aware of the &ldquo;step&rdquo; that exists at the levy threshold when the threshold was introduced. I have no plans at present to change the system. Nonetheless, I am aware of the difficulties encountered by persons when their income increases to just above the threshold and its operation will continue to be reviewed on a regular basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is well aware of the services that people require to combat the late effects of polio. Since coming into office, this Government has allocated just over &euro;175 million for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, &euro;29.616 million has been provided specifically for aids and appliances up to the end of 2001. The aids and appliances funding for this year has not yet been allocated. Also, &euro;27.302 million has been allocated for home supports including personal assistant services from 1997 to 2002 inclusive. This level of funding is indicative of this Government's on-going commitment to the development of the broad range of home support services which are required to enable people with disabilities to live as independently as possible and also to provide relief to a significant number of carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, there are no proposals to extend automatic eligibility for medical cards to people suffering the late effects of polio. However, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family <Col N="163" /> members on this basis. In addition, non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long term illness scheme, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;53.33 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to examining the feasibility of introducing a &ldquo;cost of disability&rdquo; payment. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness states that the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance will set up and participate in a working group which will consult with the social partners to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment. The working group has commenced its work. It is being chaired by the Department of Health and Children and also includes representatives of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Department of Finance, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nation-wide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July 2002. The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next fifteen years including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority (HEA). The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.Colour RGB 0,0,128 There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable, &euro;114.28, &euro;152.39, &euro;190.46, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum, which are eligible for subvention. As the Deputy is aware, a health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. This is on foot of the Nursing Homes Subvention) (Amendment Regulations, 1996, introduced in 1996 and which added articles 22.3 and 22.4 to the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permitting health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment)(No. 3) Act, 1996. As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention to develop proposals in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. In the meantime, I remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million or &euro;35.3 million. A sum of £52 million or &euro;66.03 million was made available for 2001 while in 2002, the funding for the scheme has again been substantially increased, amounting to £72 million or &euro;91million. In the case mentioned by the Deputy, as responsibility for the provision of health services in Tipperary South rests with the South Eastern Health Board, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the national children's strategy &ldquo;Our Children &ndash; Their Lives&rdquo; was launched in November 2000. The strategy is a major Government initiative to improve the quality of children's lives. It is a ten year plan, which includes a range of proposed actions such as providing access to play and recreation facilities for children. Approximately 2,500 children participated in a consultation process for the <Col N="169" /> national children's strategy. The main issue raised by children was the lack of play and recreation facilities.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet committee on children has decided that the development of a play and recreation policy is to be a priority for the National Children's Office this year. Funding for the construction of two playgrounds has been provided on a pilot basis and the experience gained in the development of these will inform the development of the national play and recreation policy.</P>
      <P>A working group comprising representatives from government departments and key agencies has been established to develop this policy. Their work includes examination of green space provision, housing estate design, safe walkways and cycleways and the issue of insurance. There will also be a strong focus in the new policy on play facilities. The policy, including the financial implications, will be brought to Government for approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has from time to time been asked to regulate in some way the activities of persons providing body piercing services.</P>
      <P>The approach being adopted is to prepare &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; guidelines for practitioners rather than draw up specific regulations.

      <P>Responsibility for the manufacture and circulation of Irish coins rests with the Central Bank of Ireland. However, the Central Bank has informed me that as a result of the introduction of the euro, there is now far less nickel in coins in circulation than was the case before the euro entered circulation. Nickel is used in only two of the euro coins &ndash; the &euro;1 and &euro;2 coins. By contrast, nickel was used in the 5p, 10p, 20p and £1 coins of Irish currency. This pattern is replicated throughout the euro area. As a result, 92% of euro coins &ndash; in terms of the number of coins in circulation &ndash; are nickel-free as opposed to 25% of the national coins that were in circulation.</P>
      <P>The nickel used in the &euro;1 and &euro;2 coins is essentially contained inside the alloy and not on the surface of the coin, thus limiting skin contact. The Central Bank has also informed me that since the introduction of euro coins into circulation, they have received no reports of nickel allergy problems arising from the coins.</P>

      <P>All of the insurance companies providing public liability cover for hospitals and the mutual defence bodies providing indemnity cover for doctors have been indicating for some time that they are experiencing difficulties in providing cover for medical malpractice. The defence bodies face particular problems given the nature of the unlimited discretionary indemnity which they provide to their members and the basis on which this cover is provided. This is particularly so in the case of obstetric claims where the level of awards is especially high and where the claims do not emerge until several years after the event which gave rise to them. The defence bodies have made me aware of their concerns about these matters and of the possible effect of the introduction of enterprise liability on their Irish operations. I hope to continue my discussions with them so as to ensure a smooth transition from the existing arrangements to the new ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is aware that there are a number of issues surrounding the under-resourcing of the voluntary sector organisations providing health related services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. In response to issues raised, I would like to point out that there have been a number of key developments in the disability sector over the last number of years in relation to the enhancement of services and the development of new services to meet identified needs. This has been made possible by the significant increased investment over the last number of years from an additional £36.82 million in 1997 to approximately £160 million extra funding in 2001.</P>
      <P>With particular reference to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, additional funding of over £175 million has been provided by this Government for the maintenance and development of health related support services, including residential, respite, day, home support, including personal assistance, and therapy services. The ongoing element of this funding more than doubles the previous annual budget available to the sector. In 2002, I have allocated additional funding of almost &euro;40 million, including ongoing funding of &euro;30.53 million as part of my commitment to services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. A further &euro;6.411 million has been targeted at this under-resourcing of the voluntary sector and I am currently considering how this funding should be most effectively distributed across the voluntary organisations concerned. Substantial funding has been targeted at services provided by the major voluntary organisations, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, in the sector for the purpose of meeting their core funding requirements. However, despite significant funding input, some of the organisations concerned have continued to accrue substantial core deficits. This issue, together with staffing levels, has been the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department, the health boards and the voluntary organisations concerned. It is my intention to clarify this issue further in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, to encourage the development of a partnership approach between the voluntary and statutory sectors, my Department and the health boards actively engage with the voluntary sector at various national and local fora and committees, on the allocation of available funding and participation in policy development. Finally, my Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector, is currently developing a national physical and sensory disability database, which when complete, will provide a detailed picture of the service requirements of people with physical and sensory disabilities over a five year period. This database will enable a co-ordinated and planned approach <Col N="175" /> to be taken to what is ultimately most important, the delivery of services to individuals as required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of private health insurance in this country is regulated under the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001. This legislation requires all health insurers to operate on a &ldquo;community rated&rdquo; basis, that is they must charge the same premium for a given level of cover regardless of a person's age, sex or health status. The legislation also provides for open enrolment, which obliges insurers to make cover available to persons under the age of 65 regardless of whether or not they were previously covered, and for lifetime cover, which means that once a person is covered by a registered insurer, he or she cannot be deprived of cover except in limited exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the consumers, the existence of community rating represents a broad protection to the community as a whole in terms of individual insurance rate stability and equitable access to insurance cover. The viability of this system in a voluntary environment is dependent on people joining private health insurance at a young age. The surpluses that young healthy people contribute to the system facilitate the insurance of older, sicker people at premium rates that would not otherwise be affordable. The operation of community rating would not be adequately served by facilitating either the deferral of health insurance cover until aged 65 years or older, or facilitating increases in the level of cover, when <Col N="176" /> the prospect of claiming benefits is greater. Such adverse selection is among identified practices against which community rating must be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Under regulations made pursuant to the 1994 Act, persons who are already insured can increase their level of cover, but are subject to waiting periods in respect of the additional benefits. The maximum waiting period for eligibility for payments under a health insurance contract in respect of an increased level of hospital in-patient services or ancillary health services shall be two years for a person under the age of 65 years when first named under the higher contract or five years for a person of or over the age of 65 years when first named under the higher contract. Current regulations also allow for persons of, or over, the age of 65 who have existing cover with a registered health insurer, or whose cover had lapsed for less then 13 weeks to transfer to another registered health insurer without penalty as regards waiting periods already served. It is a matter for registered insurers to decide whether or not to provide cover to a person over the age of 65 years whose circumstances regarding current or previous cover are outside those laid down in the legislation and regulations.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to the 2001 Act, regulations are to be made which will remove the discretion of insurers to refuse cover to persons of, or over 65, who are not currently insured. This will occur in the context of moving to a system of &ldquo;lifetime community rating&rdquo; which involves additional premium to people who enter health insurance for the first time at older ages. This will therefore strengthen the system by providing that late joiners will be liable to pay sufficient extra premium to make up for the surplus they would have contributed had they joined at a younger age. Having regard to the reasons given in relation to the stability of the system of funding community rating, if a person over the age of 65 wishes to take out an insurance plan, in addition to an existing one, insurers are not obliged to make such supplementary cover available.</P>

      <P>The domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly allowance paid by health boards to eligible children up to the age of 16 years whose disability is so severe that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. <Col N="177" /> DCA is paid in addition to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs child benefit. Recipients of DCA also qualify for the respite care grant which in 2002 will amount to &euro;635 where there is one DCA recipient in a family and &euro;1270 where there are two or more DCA recipients in a family.</P>
      <P>The rate of DCA increases each year in line with social welfare increases. DCA was increased from &euro;164.30, £129.40, to &euro;179.80, effective from 1 January 2002. There are no plans to further increase this rate in 2002.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of dental treatment to eligible persons in Dublin 9 rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. All medical card holders over the age of 16 years are eligible for primary dental care services under the dental treatment services scheme or DTSS. This scheme provides a range of treatments, including the provision of dentures. From 1 July 2001, the scheme was extended to all persons over 70 years of age and in 2002, I made available an additional &euro;6.166 million to the scheme to meet an increased uptake. The question of how much the person concerned would have to pay under the treatment benefits scheme is a matter for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. My Department has asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>Strong and visible enforcement is critical to ensuring that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. A key objective of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, was to bring forward strengthened provisions in relation to planning enforcement. These new provisions come into force on 11 March and will address a variety of issues. The changes in the 2000 Act will encourage increased enforcement and more compliance by developers and include a new streamlined enforcement procedure. Fines <Col N="178" /> under the Act have also been greatly increased and planning authorities will retain the income from such fines. Planning authorities will also be able to recoup their expenses when they prosecute a case. In addition, applications for permission to retain unauthorised development will no longer be a defence to an enforcement action or be a reason for staying a criminal prosecution. I have also provided increased penal fees for applications for such retention permission which will act as a significant deterrent to developers from undertaking unauthorised development. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, will also enable a planning authority to refuse to grant permission to a developer who has not complied with previous permissions, subject to the consent of the High Court.</P>
      <P>I have also been concerned to ensure adequate staffing levels for local authority planning departments. I have approved numerous requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional planning posts, both professional planners and administrative staff. Staffing of local authority planning departments has almost doubled over the last four years from 660 in June 1998 to 1,284 in October 2001 and involves significant recruitment of planners from abroad. I am confident therefore that the resources available to the planning system are increasing and will continue to increase over the next number of years as a significantly expanded number of graduate planners becomes available from the educational institutions.</P>

Entry into force occurs 90 days after these conditions are met. The EU and its member states will take all necessary steps to facilitate entry into force of the protocol by the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in August and September 2002.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the consultation paper RST 20/62 is to elicit comments and submissions from interested parties by 30 April 2002 on a range of issues with a view to the future development of further qualitative improvements in taxi services. The consultation paper has been prepared against the background of the liberalised regime of taxi licensing and the stated policy that, by end 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that my Department will be <Col N="180" /> assisted by other Departments in the examination, assessment and consideration of submissions received arising from this consultation process with a view to making recommendations for the future regulation of taxi services. This will include the method of implementing the stated wheelchair accessible taxi policy and, in this regard, the issues raised in the correspondence referred to will be noted for consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the independent Taxi Hardship Panel, this panel has been asked to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship which may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of entry to the taxi industry on 21 November 2000. Persons who held a taxi licence on that date who consider that they have suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation may now make submissions to the panel by 19 April 2002, including an indication as to how their claim of hardship can be substantiated. It is proposed that the report of the findings of the panel will be presented to Government.</P>

      <P>Irish regulations dealing with spray suppression already require that, subject to certain exemptions, every vehicle and every trailer attached to a vehicle should be equipped with wings or other similar devices to catch, so far as practicable, mud or water thrown up by the rotation of the wheels, unless adequate protection is afforded by the body of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>Directive 91/226/EEC sets out the technical requirements which a spray suppression system must meet in order to obtain EC type approval certification. The Directive does not require member states to make such systems obligatory. However, my Department is finalising regulations, which I intend to introduce shortly, which will ensure that the spray suppression systems that are fitted to Irish heavy goods vehicles, accord with the type approval standards. It is envisaged that these requirements will apply to all new vehicles from a current date and to existing vehicles on a phased basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced a non-national road grant allocation of over &euro;12.143 million in 2002 for South Dublin County Council. This represents an increase of 68% on the council's 2001 allocation, 135% on the 2001 payment and almost 161% on the 1997 payment.</P>
      <P>The council's revised submission for 2002, under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme, included applications for the Greenhills Road realignment scheme and the green route/Ballyboden Road Grange Road scheme. The Knocklyon Road scheme was not included in the council's revised submission.</P>
      <P>These applications, together with all other applications under the EU co-financed specific improvement grants scheme were considered in my Department having regard to compliance with the eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the funding available for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council's 2002 non-national roads grant allocation includes an allocation of &euro;2 million for the Greenhills Road realignment scheme. In the event the Green Route/ Ballyboden Road-<Col N="182" /> Grange Road scheme was not selected for advancement under the scheme in 2002.</P>
    <P>It is open to South Dublin County Council to make an application for funding for these schemes in 2003 in response to my Department's request for applications which will issue later in the year.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 10(2) of the Fire Services Act, 1981, the provision of a fire service is a matter for the local fire authority concerned, in this case Dublin City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department assists fire authorities in the provision of a fire service through a range of functions, including sponsoring the legislation underpinning the fire service, capital funding &ndash; which <Col N="184" /> I have substantially increased during my term of office &ndash; the development and updating of an emergency planning framework and guidelines and the promotion of training and other initiatives.</P>
    <P>During 2001, the council purchased six new fire appliances for which I provided grant aid of more than &euro;1.52 million. In addition, I approved the purchase of a further four fire appliances for which a tender proposal has recently been received in my Department. I also approved the provision of a command control and mobilising system in the new CAMP east region control centre in Townsend Street for which grant aid amounting to &euro;6.86 million is being provided. A new full-time fire station is now nearing completion in Swords, with grant aid of &euro;1.65 million from my Department.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by Dublin City Council in providing a fire and emergency service for Dublin city and county in 2001 was approximately &euro;62.5 million. Having regard to the above and from the information available to my Department, I am satisfied that Dublin Fire Brigade is being appropriately supported in relation to its task of providing an adequate and effective response to fire and other emergencies.</P>

      <P>The primary response to such circumstances rests with the front line emergency services &ndash; the Garda Síochána, local authorities, including the fire brigade, and health boards. If required the front line emergency services can call on the support of the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, other voluntary organisations and relevant Departments.</P>
      <P>Each of the front line emergency services has prepared its own plans and strategies for dealing with major emergencies. These plans set out the responsibilities of each service in an emergency and requirements in relation to co-ordination and testing. Any one of the three main emergency services can activate the plan which will likely involve a collaborative effort on the part of all the agencies.</P>
      <P>At national level responsibility for emergency planning rests with Departments for services within their areas of responsibility. My Department's role is to support the local authority service through a range of functions including capital funding, which I have substantially increased during my term of office, the development and upgrading of an emergency planning framework and guidelines and the provision of training and other initiatives to ensure that the authorities respond promptly and effectively to emergencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department chairs an interdepartmental group, involving the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Defence. This committee is an advisory body which monitors and advises on the preparation, co-ordination and testing of plans by the emergency services as necessary, on the co-ordination arrangements at national level to facilitate the response of the local authorities, health boards and the Garda Síochána to major emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" />More recently the office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence, established following the events of 11 September, is required to exercise an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between the different planning requirements.</P>

      <P>The NDP provides for a total investment of approximately &euro;30 billion at current prices in the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000 to 2006. Of the total planned investment approximately &euro;24 billion is for infrastructure programmes coming within the remit of my <Col N="188" /> Department, including national and non-national roads, water and waste water, housing, waste management and urban and village development.</P>
      <P>Satisfactory progress in implementation is being made by local authorities and the National Roads Authority with which responsibility for programming and management of individual projects rests. Expenditure on these programmes in 2000 amounted to £1.75 billion or &euro;2.222 billion which was in line with NDP targets. Good progress has been maintained in 2001. Provisional figures indicate that combined expenditure to the end of 2001 on national roads, housing and water services amounted to approximately &euro;2.66 billion or 106% of projected expenditure for the year. A Supplementary Estimate benefited national roads by &euro;121 million and water services by &euro;80 million.</P>
      <P>The Abridged Estimates for my Department for 2002, published on 15 November 2001, together with the additional allocations announced in the budget, provide for an increase of over 18% in 2002 in spending by my Department over the 2001 Revised Estimates provision. Taking account of the already unprecedented volume of investment in NDP infrastructure programmes, this level of funding will ensure a continuation of activity at a high level under these programmes.</P>
      <P>This continuing high level of capital investment reflects the Government's commitment to the implementation of the NDP, in particular the infrastructure elements of the plan that are crucial to future competitiveness and social progress.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the protection and improvement of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, exercises general supervision in relation to the performance of these functions by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Water quality in Ireland is generally satisfactory. The EPA report on water quality in Ireland for the period 1998-2000, launched on 24 January 2002, indicates, for the first time since national surveys commenced in 1971, a reversal in the downward trend in water quality with a reported increase in the length of unpolluted river channel, from 67% in 1995-97 period to 70% in 1998-2000 period. In addition lake surface area classified as unpolluted has increased from 65% to 93% over the same periods.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive national strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication over-enrichment, caused mainly by excess inputs of phosphorus. As part of the strategy, major catchment-based projects have been advanced in respect of Loughs Derg, Ree and Leane &ndash; Killarney &ndash; and the Rivers Suir, Boyne and Liffey to establish water quality monitoring and management systems. The catchment based strategy is underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by end 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is now promoting the estab<Col N="192" /> lishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters, and all sources of water pollution. These projects will facilitate implementation of the recently adopted EU water framework directive which requires the achievement of at least good water status, as defined in the directive, generally within a 15-year timeframe, in a co-ordinated programme of measures by all relevant authorities in relation to the management of water quality and quantity. River basin management projects for the east, the south-east, the River Shannon and the west have been approved in principle. Financial support at a rate of 100% will be provided by my department for expenditure incurred by local authorities in relation to these projects.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive approach is being supported by my Department's major investment programme in sewerage infrastructure facilities throughout the country. The national development plan provides for capital investment of &euro;3,700 million on water services, the major portion of which will be devoted to waste water infrastructure. The investment programme places particular emphasis on the provision of phosphorus reduction facilities where a need is indicated in this regard.</P>
    <P>Ten water bodies were designated as sensitive areas under regulations made in 1994, which required the provision of phosphorus reduction facilities in the large urban waste water treatment plants concerned. This work has been completed. In June 2001 I made the Urban Waste Water Treatment Regulations, 2001, which designated a further 30 water bodies as sensitive areas and require the provision of nutrient reduction facilities, phosphorus and-or nitrogen, by 31 May 2008. Comprehensive details of the nutrient reduction programme to be pursued have been finalised. A total of 32 urban areas have been identified of which 11 already have the required nutrient reduction facilities in place. The remaining works will be undertaken as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Facilitated by regulations which I made in 1998 to extend and strengthen their powers, by-laws have been made by certain local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts to protect waters against pollution by agriculture. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has substantial initiatives underway to tackle phosphorus inputs from agriculture, including the rural environment protection scheme and the new farm waste management scheme.</P>
    <P>In December 1999 I signed a voluntary agreement with the Irish Chemical and Detergents Association Detergents, ICDA, then known as the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association, for the effective phasing-out of the marketing by its members of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergents products in Ireland. ICDA members supply some 90% of the domestic laundry detergents marketed in Ireland. These targets <Col N="193" /> set under the agreement are being reached or exceeded. In addition, my Department is liaising with the non-ICDA suppliers in relation to the remaining 10% of the market with a view to obtaining similar commitments for the own-brand sector. Significant progress is being made in this regard.</P>
    <P>An assessment prepared by the EPA, at the request of my Department, in relation to the trophic status of estuaries and bays, identified a total of 17 estuarine water bodies as eutrophic or potentially eutrophic. This assessment became available in March 2001 and indicated a need to reduce nitrates inputs to waters in extensive areas in the east, south east and south which flow into these estuaries. This is of particular significance in the context of the implementation of the nitrates directive.</P>
    <P>Proposals are now being developed in my Department for regulations to provide a statutory basis for the application in all areas of established standards of good farming practice. These will give further effect to a number of EU directives on waste and water quality, including the nitrates directive, and generally strengthen and support measures for the protection of the environment. It would be possible in the context of these regulations for the livestock manure application limits specified in the nitrates directive to be applied in all areas or to certain areas designated as nitrate vulnerable zones. The detailed provisions of the regulations will be developed over the coming months in consultation with the farming bodies and other interests. An information paper from my Department on good agricultural practice and protection of the Environment sets out the background issues involved and responds to queries raised in recent discussions with the main farming organisations and other interested parties. A copy of the paper is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>While other forms of water pollution, such as contamination by metals, synthetic organic chemicals and hydrocarbons are of minor significance in Ireland, reflecting the low level of heavy industry, I made the Water Quality (Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2001 to assist in reducing further the discharges of these contaminants. These set water quality standards for a number of substances, including certain pesticides, solvents and metals, to provide additional protection for waters and give further effect to EU Directive 76/464/EEC, the Dangerous Substances Directive. I will take such additional measures as I consider appropriate from time to time to provide for adequate management and protection of water quality to combat water pollution from all sources.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less &euro;7.62. This &euro;7.62 <Col N="195" /> represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than &euro;7.62 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent. Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full-time employment. However, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years now which allow people on approved schemes such as community employment to retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of &euro;317.43 per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000 substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000.</P>
    <P>The &euro;317.43 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in year three and 25% in year four. As a result, many participants in community employment schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families.</P>
    <P>In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of supplementary welfare allowance. All community employment recipients are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of supplementary welfare allowance, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board was contacted regarding this situation and they have advised that when this issue was brought to their attention they examined their records and identified all cases where a rent supplement was being paid to persons on community employment schemes.</P>
    <P>The board has commenced a review of every case to ensure that the terms of Circular 3/2000 were correctly applied. Persons who may have been affected will be contacted individually and arrangements made for the payment of any arrears due without delay.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have responsibility for the general policy on intoxicating liquor legislation which is essentially concerned with the number and nature of licensed outlets and the persons to be licensed, as well as the times at which, and the persons to whom, liquor may be sold. This is not an easy task, nor is it something which I undertake lightly. Any change in policy requires very careful consideration and deliberation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of extended hours possibly leading to an increase in alcohol-related problems was discussed in the Dáil and Seanad debates leading <Col N="197" /> up to enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. As the Deputy is aware, a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights had completed a review of liquor licensing in 1998 and had made a series of recommendations in relation to various aspects of the licensing code, including longer opening hours. I also engaged in extensive consultations with various interested parties prior to the passage of the 2000 Act at which the issue of extending opening hours was discussed.</P>
    <P>With a view to continuing the important work of reforming the liquor licensing code, I established a Commission on Liquor Licensing in November 2000 with the task of reviewing the liquor licensing system in the light of all relevant factors and making recommendations for a system geared to meeting the needs of consumers in a competitive market environment, while taking due account of the social, health and economic interest of a modern society. I understand that the commission has been examining issues relating to licensing hours and that the conclusions of these deliberations will be set out in a future report. I will, of course, carefully consider any recommendations that the commission will make in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in respect of Drogheda was received in November of last year and is under consideration by the advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications. The advisory committee is also considering applications from other cities and towns throughout the country. When this process is completed, it will submit its recommendations to me and I will then decide on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that I announced late in 2000 that the number of Garda CCTV systems was to be extended. As part of the first tranche of this expansion, CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. It is intended that these ten CCTV systems will be installed and operational by the end of 2002. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tenders have been sought and received in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway <Col N="198" /> and Limerick. The evaluation process is in its final stages and I hope to announce the awarding of the contracts shortly, after which work will commence immediately to put the systems in place.</P>
    <P>The planning in respect of the town centre CCTV systems for Waterford, Athlone, Tallaght and Clondalkin is well advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited via the EU Journal and the national newspapers within the next three months.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to introduce a grant scheme soon to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead on their own with a local CCTV system. While it will be up to the local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes, grant assistance will be provided.</P>
    <P>To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system when and as they require it. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are currently being finalised and full details of the scheme including relevant conditions and grant levels will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>The task group to which the Deputy refers was established, at my request, by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) in Autumn 2000. It reported to me in March 2001.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the report, I authorised the NCCA to proceed with the first phase of the task group's proposal, ie, a research phase designed to provide a critical analysis of current driver provision at senior cycle. This will include, <i>inter alia</i>, carrying out an inventory of the work already being done in the area of driver education in various schools throughout the country. The NCCA has asked Trinity College Dublin to carry out the research project and a preliminary survey has been posted to all post-primary schools. It is expected that the results of the research phase will be presented to the task group in May 2002 and made available to all the bodies involved as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Another recent development in driver education at school level is the issue to all second-level schools in September 2001, of a pack called Staying Alive. This is a road safety resource, produced under the aegis of the National Safety Council. It was produced primarily for transition year students, but can be used at any stage of senior cycle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 to 181, inclusive, 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the overriding need to ensure that the quality of care provided by my Department's centres for young offenders, including the Finglas facility, meets recognised standards. Therefore, it is my intention that each centre will be independently inspected by an external agency as soon as possible. Independent inspection will give reassurance concerning the standard of care being provided, the efficacy of the systems and procedures being followed and the efficiency of each centre's operations. My Department has consulted with the centres and the social services inspectorate on this matter.</P>
      <P>As I have already informed the Deputy, the Finglas centre will be the first centre to be inspected in this manner. Mr. Mike Laxton, an international residential child care expert has been appointed to carry out this task. He commenced the inspection process this week. I am confident that independent inspection will identify any weaknesses that may exist and give confidence that the children concerned are being cared for in a manner that accords with established best practice. Mr. Laxton will have access to recent complaints received concerning the centre and to the recent questions tabled by the Deputy. I would also be pleased to arrange for a meeting between the Deputy and the inspector in order to ensure that he is aware of her concerns regarding the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 January 2001 the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Hanafin, who has responsibility for children, visited the centre where she met the children, staff and management. A wide range of matters were discussed in the course of her visit. Matters raised in this manner are normally followed up routinely by my Department's officials. This would occur through either contact with the centre's management and/or, where <Col N="204" /> appropriate, the relevant Department inspector or the child care advisor would be asked to visit the centre and report on the issues raised. This was the position in this case where the Department requested its child care advisor to examine aspects of the centre's operations. I have arranged for all departmental files containing any relevant submissions, correspondence and reports concerning this centre for the past three years to be made available to the independent inspector as part of the inspection process.</P>
    <P>The detailed operational information requested by the Deputy in relation to the centre is currently being assembled and will be forwarded to her as soon as possible. Much of the information requested is not readily available in my Department and must be provided from the Finglas Children's Centre.</P>
    <P>My Department has sought a report from the centre's board of management in relation to the Deputy's questions concerning its actions and a response is awaited. The board is scheduled to meet next week where the matters raised will be considered. A written response will issue to the Deputy when the Department receives its response.</P>
    <P>Last week my Department sent a copy of the standards and criteria for inspection to the Deputy. When the independent inspection of the Finglas centre is concluded and the report on the inspection is received, my Department will be in a position to consider whether further steps or action might be required in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The school's authorities have since written to my Department to appeal the decision. They indicated that further information will be provided as soon as possible to support their appeal. On receipt of this information the matter of the long-term accommodation requirements of the school will be re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the long-term enrolment figure has been agreed the post-primary building unit will be in touch with the school authorities regarding the completion of an educational worksheet.

      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular: the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998. Its report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. I have asked my officials to forward a copy of the report to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level. One of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants schemes is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, <Col N="208" /> 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, for example, where advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. To date it appears that no such advice or instruction has been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an applicant considers that s/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, s/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance/access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution. It provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from &euro;2.49 million or £1.964 million in respect of the 2000/01 academic year to &euro;7.49 <Col N="209" /> million or £5.9 million in respect of the 2001-02 academic year.</P>

      <P>I have been informed that, since its establishment, a psychological service was provided to this school by a voluntary body under the aegis of the Southern Health Board. This service was withdrawn on a temporary basis, beginning in September 2001, due to the resignation of a member of staff.</P>
      <P>I am aware the children in the school have complex needs and that many of them require support from both clinical and educational psychologists. The National Educational Psychological Service Agency (NEPS) is liaising with the voluntary body with the aim of eventually providing a joint clinical-educational psychological service to the school.</P>
      <P>NEPS is extending its service to further schools as additional psychologists are appointed. At present, the agency does not have a sufficient complement of psychologists in the southern region to be able to offer a full educational psychological service to all schools. However, a recruitment competition for additional psychologists is now nearing completion, and it is expected that a number of appointments will be made to the southern region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, NEPS has taken some preliminary steps towards offering a full service to this school. A NEPS senior psychologist experienced in the area of disability has undertaken a detailed analysis of its needs for educational psychological support. Members of the NEPS management team have arranged a series of visits to the school to discuss the outcomes of the survey with the school principal and with representatives of the parents.</P>
      <P>The school may avail of my Department's scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, full details of which are available from NEPS or from my Department's website.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is a special school catering for children with specific <Col N="210" /> learning disability. Under present arrangements and within the context of Circular 12/96, pupils who function intellectually at specific levels may be granted exemption from the study of Irish.</P>
      <P>Irish is a compulsory subject in all second level schools that come under the jurisdiction of my Department. There are certain circumstances whereby an exemption from the study of Irish may be granted, which have been notified to schools in the form of Circular M10/94. Under the terms of this circular, my Department has delegated authority to the principals of second level schools to grant the exemptions.</P>
      <P>In the case where exemption from Irish has been granted to pupils at primary level, the primary school should forward copies of the primary certificates to the second level school involved. The principal of the second level school will then issue a second level certificate where appropriate.</P>
      <P>If it transpires the pupil is not eligible for an exemption, the second level programme in Irish has the capacity to cater for a wide diversity of ability. The programme currently includes a foundation level Irish syllabus, which is specifically designed for those pupils who are experiencing difficulty with the subject. Options in this area should be discussed with the school.</P>

      <Col N="213" />Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): The home tuition scheme operated by my Department seeks to ensure that a pupil who cannot attend school at a particular juncture continues to receive a certain level of educational provision. The scheme allows for the provision of up to nine hours one-to-one tuition per week, which is generally provided in the child's home. Home tuition was not offered as an alternative to mainstream education for the child referred to by the Deputy, rather it is meant to ensure the continuation of a certain level of education during the period that a suitable full-time school placement is being sought for her.</P>
    <P>In order to progress this case further a questionnaire issued to the child's mother, which has helped identify her educational needs and provide my Department with written permission to contact schools and the National Educational Psychological Service on behalf of her child. The advice of my Department's inspectorate has been sought in this case, and I understand that St. Declan's Community College, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford, has agreed to enrol the child from September 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular: the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but for schools, parents and publishers. I have asked my officials to forward a copy of the report to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could <Col N="214" /> be adopted to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its needs.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department is examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. In relation to second level schools, my Department continues to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools in line with the report's recommendations.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, recent changes in the economy have highlighted the need for a workforce that is scientifically literate. As the National Competitiveness Council points out in its recently published, &ldquo;National Competitiveness Challenge 2001&rdquo;, such an educational base is needed to provide a basis for future growth, to attract increasingly science-based international investment to Ireland, and to encourage successful entrepreneurship and innovation.</P>
      <P>In late 1997, the Government set up the business, education and training partnership to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skills needs, manpower needs estimation, and education and training for business. The expert group on future skills needs is one element of this partnership. In the course of its work, the expert group has examined the skills needs in a number of different sectors. In its second report, published in March 2000, the expert group expressed its concern over the number and quality of students choosing to study science at third level. These concerns were reiterated in the expert group's third report, published in July 2001. In response to such concerns, in October 2000 I established the task force on the physical sciences to address the issues in relation to the uptake of the sciences at both second and third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data on the subsequent employment of graduates is available in the Higher Education Authority's First Destination of Awards Recipients in Higher Education (1999) report. In relation to the employment of science degree recipients, the report notes that of those in employment in Ireland 40.7% of primary degree holders and 52.7% of higher degree holders were employed <Col N="215" /> as scientific technicians or professionals. Science degree recipients were also working in a number of other occupations which could be classified as relevant to their degree, for example in the engineering, medical, agricultural, or environmental sectors or as teachers or lecturers. In all, only 1.6% of 1999 primary science degree recipients and 3.5% of higher science degree recipients were classified as seeking employment.</P>
